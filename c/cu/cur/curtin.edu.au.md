# Curtin University of Technology - Terms and Conditions

At Curtin University of Technology, the privacy of our students, staff and the people we deal with is very important to us. Much of the information that the University collects in order to provide the services that it does, is "personal information".

Under the _Higher Education Support Act 2003 (C'th)_ (HESA) the University must comply with the Information Privacy Principles of the _Privacy Act 1988 (C'th)_ in respect of students' personal information obtained for the purposes of chapters 3 & 4 of the HESA. To help further protect your personal information, the University voluntarily commits to meet the standards set by the National Privacy Principles of the _Privacy Act 1988_ in respect of all personal information that it handles.

The personal information you provide will be accessed by University officers strictly for the purposes stated at time of collection. The information will be disclosed to State and Australian Government agencies where required by law, and to contractors engaged by the University to perform services on its behalf. Where personal information is to be provided to contractors, the University will require that confidentiality agreements be first entered into.

Where necessary, the University may disclose personal information of its students to external organisations such as professional bodies, hospitals and schools in order to enable those students to undertake a practical experience/clinical component of their course.

Under the Guiding Ethical Principles, members of the University community are responsible for respecting an individual's right to privacy. This means the University will not disclose personal information for any purpose other than what has been advised at time of collection, unless:

  * the University has obtained your explicit consent, or
  * the information is required by law, or
  * in the exceptional circumstance that withholding information would likely result in a serious threat to the health, safety or life of yourself, another individual, individuals or the general public.



Staff and students are members of the University community and as such are required to respect each individual's right to privacy.
