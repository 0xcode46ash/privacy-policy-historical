# Curtin University of Technology - Copyright, privacy and legal issues

At Curtin University, the privacy of our students, staff and the people we deal with is very important to us. Much of the information that the University collects in order to provide the services that it does, is "personal information".

## Curtin's level of compliance

Under the _Higher Education Support Act 2003 (C'th)_ (HESA) the University must comply with the Information Privacy Principles of the _Privacy Act 1988 (C'th)_ in respect of students' personal information obtained for the purposes of chapters 3 & 4 of the HESA. To help further protect your personal information, the University voluntarily commits to meet the standards set by the National Privacy Principles of the _Privacy Act 1988_ in respect of all personal information that it handles.

## Personal information

## Updating your personal data

Curtin staff and students can update their personal contact data through the OASIS portal. [Login](http://oasis.curtin.edu.au/) and navigate to 'My employment' (staff), or 'My studies & eValuate' (students) to update your details.

The personal information you provide will be accessed by University officers strictly for the purposes stated at time of collection. The information will be disclosed to State and Australian Government agencies where required by law, and to contractors engaged by the University to perform services on its behalf. Where personal information is to be provided to contractors, the University will require that confidentiality agreements be first entered into.

## Disclosure of personal information to other parties

## About the security of your data.

The University will not pass your information to any third party without your permission other than for the reasons detailed on the left. Curtin IT Services provide detailed information on how they manage [information security](http://cits.curtin.edu.au/global/infosecurity.cfm).

Where necessary, the University may disclose personal information of its students to external organisations such as professional bodies, hospitals and schools in order to enable those students to undertake a practical experience/clinical component of their course.

Under the Guiding Ethical Principles, members of the University community are responsible for respecting an individual's right to privacy. This means the University will not disclose personal information for any purpose other than what has been advised at time of collection, unless:

  * the University has obtained your explicit consent, or
  * the information is required by law, or
  * in the exceptional circumstance that withholding information would likely result in a serious threat to the health, safety or life of yourself, another individual, individuals or the general public.



Staff and students are members of the University community and as such are required to respect each individual's right to privacy.
