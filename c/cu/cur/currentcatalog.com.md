The purpose of this privacy policy is to let you know what kind of information we collect, with whom it may be shared, what choices you have regarding our use of your information, and how you may review and change some of the data you provide to us. 

As we continue to develop our website and take advantage of technologies to improve the services we offer, this policy likely will change. We will not be notifying you directly but will post the changes here in the Privacy Policy. We therefore encourage you to refer to this policy on an ongoing basis so that you understand our current privacy policy.

**Do We Share Your Information?**  
The information gathered may be shared with corporate affiliates of www.CurrentCatalog.com. We also share the information with third parties, including responsible companies with which we have a relationship. For example:

Some of our vendors may work closely with us to create a vendor shop within the www.CurrentCatalog.com site or to ship your order directly to you. In certain instances, we may share certain information about you with that vendor (e.g., if you decide to buy their products).

You also may make a purchase from www.CurrentCatalog.com through a link from another website or search engine and may use their express checkout tool to do so. When you do, please be aware that both www.CurrentCatalog.com and that website or search engine will receive your information.

In some cases, www.CurrentCatalog.com may enter into a co-branding relationship with another website that offers you products or services that supplement www.CurrentCatalog.com's assortment (e.g., flowers). In those cases, you may link from www.CurrentCatalog.com to another site to purchase the item. In that case, both www.CurrentCatalog.com and the other website may receive your information. 

We may retain reliable third party companies to provide order fulfillment and customer service on our behalf and they will have access to your information.

www.CurrentCatalog.com may team with another website to conduct a sweepstakes or other event (e.g., a live web chat). In those cases, each of the participating websites may collect or receive personal information from you. 

For some of our products, www.CurrentCatalog.com may provide you with a link to the supplier of that product so that you may get further information. If you link to the supplier's site, the supplier may collect or receive information about you.

For example, we retain outside companies (i.e. Experian and Cheetah mail) to manage a database containing certain customer information or to create and distribute an e-mail offering. In those situations, the outside party is performing work for www.CurrentCatalog.com, and www.CurrentCatalog.com takes appropriate steps designed to ensure your information is used only to provide the services requested by www.CurrentCatalog.com, and not for other purposes.

Additionally, www.CurrentCatalog.com may share account or other information when we believe it is necessary to comply with law or to protect our interests or property.

And in the event that some or all of the business assets of www.CurrentCatalog.com are sold or transferred, we generally would transfer the corresponding information about our customers.

www.CurrentCatalog.com may share your personal information with unrelated outside companies so that they can directly market their products or services to you if we feel that a company offers products or services that we believe may be of interest. We also may provide you with the opportunity to signup on our website to receive such e-mail offers.

**Security**  
  
---  
  
Is a credit card transaction of this type really safe from fraud? The short answer is "Yes." The long answer is... 

Most consumers do not realize that security protocols and technologies currently exist to protect them. Most of the reported credit card fraud over the internet has involved people emailing their credit card account numbers to merchants, or web sites accepting credit cards without using any security protocols. 

Such potentially insecure methods of data transmission are not used here at Current USA, Inc. We employ the latest in internet security and electronic commerce security:

**Operating System Security.**   
The Current USA, Inc. online store operates under the Windows NT operating system. We have employed the strictest security (secure users, groups and passwords) offered by Microsoft¹s high-end operating system. 

**Database Security.**   
Current USA, Inc. gathers customers, products, and orders in databases. Those databases are secured with passwords set up at the table level. Even someone typing on the computer the database is stored on would have to know the database passwords to gain access to the information. 

**Encoded Credit Card Slips.**   
Credit card transactions (or slips, as they are known in the banking industry) are encoded using the Secure Electronic Commerce (SET) standard pioneered by Visa and MasterCard. Even if someone were to intercept a transaction, they would not be able to gain access to the information. Credit card transactions are handled in real time between your credit card issuer and our bank. 

**SSL Server Certificate.**  
Current USA Inc. uses an SSL server certificate. What¹s a server certificate? A company wanting to do business on the world wide web must prove to a trusted third party, such as VeriSign Inc. or Thawte Consulting, that they really exist and have the right to use a particular domain name (Internet address). An SSL Certificate is then assigned to that business that authenticates their domain. 

When a customer uses a modern web browser (such as Netscape Navigator or Microsoft Internet Explorer), the browser can automatically check the business's authenticity. If the browser can't verify that VeriSign or Thawte vouches for the business, it will refuse to start an encrypted session, or at least pop up a window warning the customer that the browser can't determine authenticity. The encryption mechanism used for SSL certificates is so secure, the U.S. government prohibits its export outside the United States. 

So shopping with us at Current USA Inc. really is safe. In fact, it would be much easier for a thief to steal your credit card information from the carbon copy of a receipt than to intercept an online secure transaction at our web site.

This policy is effective as of July 1, 2004.  
Last revised on February 25, 2005.
