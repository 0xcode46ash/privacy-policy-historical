# About the CCA - Privacy Policy

At the Canadian Curling Association (CCA), we are committed to collecting, using and disclosing your personal information responsibly and to maintaining the accuracy, confidentiality and security of such personal information.

Personal information includes information that tells us specifically who you are, such as your address, telephone number and e mail address. However, publicly available information, such as a public directory listing of your name, address and telephone number is not considered personal information.

We have adopted the following privacy policy that guides how we collect, use and disclose personal information about Members. Our intent is to balance our legitimate business interests in collecting, using and disclosing your personal information against your reasonable expectations of privacy.

**A. Definitions**

1) “Business” means the business of operating the Canadian Curling Association, which includes the Web site;  
2) “Member” means a customer, visitor and electronic member of the Web site.  
3) “we”, “us”, “our” and “CCA” refer to the Canadian Curling Association; and  
4) “Web site” refers to the web site found at www.curling.ca.

 **B. Collection of Personal Information**

Our primary purpose in collecting personal information from you and about you is to ensure the provision of high quality products and/or services. We only collect personal information from and about you that we consider necessary for achieving this purpose and to permit us to conduct the Business diligently.

We may collect personal information that you supply to us by sending us personal correspondence, such as e-mails or letters, or by registering in a secure portion of the Web site.

 **C. Use of Your Personal Information**

We may use the personal information we collect from and about you to:  
1) ensure the provision of high quality products and/or services;  
2) inform you about online and offline offers, products, services, updates and events;

4) establish and maintain communication with you;  
5) assist us in complying with legal and regulatory requirements;  
6) invoice you for products and/or services;  
7) collect unpaid accounts.

We may also use your personal information as may be described to you at the time of collection. We may compare and review your personal information for errors and omissions and for accuracy.

If you choose to provide us with your financial information, we only use that financial information in order to complete the transaction for which it is intended. For example, when making a purchase on the Web site, we ask you to provide information by filling out and submitting a form. This information enables us to process your order. Any financial information collected by us in the context of such a purchase is strictly limited in use to processing your order. Your financial information (i.e. your credit card number) will not be stored electronically. Following the approval of the transaction, the financial information will be deleted from our system.

We may use personal information about you, in a non-personally identifiable manner, to improve our marketing and promotional efforts, to improve our content and product offerings, and to customize our Web site’s content, layout and services. These uses are to enable us to improve the Business and to better tailor the Business to meet your needs.

 **D. Disclosure of Personal Information**

As a matter of policy, we do not sell, rent or lease any of your personal information to third parties without your explicit consent. However, there are a variety of circumstances where we may need to disclose some of your personal information, including the following:  
1) We may disclose your personal information to an individual who, in our reasonable judgement, is seeking the information as your agent. For example, we may provide your personal information to your legal representative if we are satisfied that the individual is requesting the information on your behalf.  
2) We may disclose your personal information as may be required by law.  
3) We may aggregate personal information and disclose such information in a non-personally identifiable manner to advertisers and other third parties for marketing and promotional purposes.

 **E. Control of Your Password**

You are responsible for all actions taken with any user ID and/or password used to access the Web site. Therefore, we recommend that you not disclose your password to any third parties. If you choose to share your user ID, your password or your personal information with a third party, you are responsible for all actions resulting therefrom. If you lose control of your password, you may lose substantial control over certain personal information. Therefore, if your password has been compromised for any reason, you should immediately change your password.

 **F. Shopping On-line - Encryption Technology, Cookies and Web Beacons**

When you order from our on-line catalogue, we offer the use of a secure server. We use Verisign secure server software, which is among the best software available today for secure commerce transactions. Verisign encrypts all information you input before it is sent to us, including credit card number, name and address, so that it cannot be read as the information travels over the Internet. While providing such information online is secure, doing so is voluntary, and you may otherwise choose to order by telephone (1-800-550-2875) or by fax (1-613-834-0716).

To ensure that our Web site is well managed and to facilitate improved navigation within the Web site, we or our service provider(s) may use cookies (small text files stored in a user’s browser) or web beacons (electronic images that allow the Web site to count visitors who have accessed a particular page and to access certain cookies) to collect aggregate data. We may use such devices to track information on our systems and identify categories of visitors by items such as IP address, domain, browser type and pages visited. This information is reported to our webmasters who use the information to analyze the number of visitors to different areas of the Web site and to make sure that our Web site is serving as a useful, effective information source. 

Neither our cookies nor web beacons collect any personal information such as your name or email address. Further, most browsers permit individuals to decline cookies. However, under specific circumstances, visitors may be denied access to some parts of our site if their browsers are set to decline cookies.

 **G. Access, Review, Change and Destruction of Your Personal Information**

You may access, review and/or change the personal information we have in our files by submitting a written request to do so to our Privacy Information Officer at the address below. We ask that you promptly advise us of any changes to your information.

Upon your written request, we will destroy, as soon as reasonably possible and in accordance with our internal policies and applicable law, any and all personal information that we have in our files about you. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we will retain in our files some personal information in order to enable us to collect any unpaid accounts and/or as may be required by law.

 **H. Other Information Collectors**

Except as otherwise expressly included in this Privacy Policy, this document only addresses the collection, use and disclosure of personal information WE collect from and about you. To the extent that you disclose your personal information to other parties, different rules may apply to their collection, use or disclosure of such personal information. Since we do not control the privacy policies of third parties, you are subject to the privacy policies of such third parties.

 **I. Protecting Your Privacy**

The personal information that is retained by us is kept in a secure environment and we use reasonable procedural and technical safeguards to protect your personal information against loss, theft and unauthorized access or disclosure. With regard to the Web site, all personal information is stored on a separate and secure database server that is protected by state-of-the-art firewall technology.

While we employ many different security techniques to protect such data from unauthorized access by users inside and outside the company, we cannot ensure perfect security, particularly in relation to the Web site.

 **J. Amendments to This Policy**

We may amend this Privacy Policy at any time by mailing (including regular mail and email) any amended terms to you or by posting the amended terms on the Web site. All amended terms shall automatically be effective five days (5) days after mailing or on the date of posting.
