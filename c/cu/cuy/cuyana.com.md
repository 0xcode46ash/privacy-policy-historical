## WHAT PERSONAL INFORMATION DOES CUYANA COLLECT?

The information we gather from customers enables us to sell our customers products and personalize and improve our services. We collect the following types of information from our customers:

We may receive and store any information you enter on our website or provide to us in any other way. The types of Personal Information collected may include your full name, gender, email address, mobile phone number, credit card and/or other payment information, IP address, browser information, username, password, time zone and any other information necessary for us to provide sell your products and otherwise provide our services. You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of many of our special features. The Personal Information you provide may be used for such purposes as responding to your requests for certain products and services, customizing the advertising and content you see and communicating with you about specials, sales offers and new products.

  * Registration: In order for you to use our website, you may be required to complete a registration form. As part of this registration form, we require your first and last name, your email address and confirmation that you are 18 years or older; provided that, you should refer to our Terms of Use for additional age restrictions. 
  * Ordering: To process your order for products and services, we require contact information (such as billing address) and credit card information. This information is used for billing purposes and to fill your orders.



Personal Information Collected Automatically:

  * We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with our Site or use our services. Cuyana automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser including your IP address, cookie information and the page you requested.
  * Generally, our service automatically collects usage information, such as the numbers and frequency of visitors to our Site and its components, similar to TV ratings that indicate how many people watched a particular show. Cuyana only uses this data in aggregate form, that is, as a statistical measure, and not in a manner that would identify you personally. This type of aggregate data enables us to figure out how often customers use parts of the Site or services so that we can make the Site appealing to as many customers as possible and improve those services. As part of this use of information, we may provide aggregate information to our partners about how our customers, collectively, use our Site or services. We share this type of statistical data so that our partners also understand how often people use the Site or services, so that they, too, may provide you with an optimal online experience. Again, Cuyana never discloses aggregate information to a partner in a manner that would identify you personally.



E-mail Communications:

We often receive a confirmation when you open an email from Cuyana if your computer supports this type of program. Cuyana uses this confirmation to help make emails more interesting and helpful. We also may compare our customer list to lists received from other companies, in an effort to avoid sending unnecessary messages to our customers. When you receive e-mail from Cuyana, you can opt out of receiving further e-mails by emailing us at info@cuyana.com.

Information from Other Sources:

For purposes such as improving the personalization of our service, we may receive information about you from other sources and add it to our account information. We also sometimes receive updated delivery and address information from our shippers or other sources so that we can correct our records and deliver your next purchase or communication more easily.

What About Cookies?

  * Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer’s hard drive through your browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser and tell us how and when pages in our site are visited and by how many people. We use cookies to enhance visitors’ experiences, to learn more about their use of the Site and to improve quality.

We strongly recommend that you leave the cookies activated, however, because cookies enable you to take advantage of some of our Site’s most attractive features.
  * Ads appearing on the Site may be delivered to users by our advertising partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to compile information about you or others who use your computer.
