FACTS                 WITH YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?
                      Financial companies choose how they share your personal information. Federal law gives
Why?                  consumers the right to limit some but not all sharing. Federal law also requires us to tell you how
                      we collect, share, and protect your personal information. Please read this notice carefully to
                      understand what we do.
What?                 The types of personal information we collect and share depend on the product or service you
                      have with us. This information can include:
                            Social Security number and account balances

                            Credit history and overdraft history
                      When you are no longer our member, we continue to share your information as described in this
                      notice.
How?                  All financial companies need to share members’ personal information to run their everyday
                      business. In the section below, we list the reasons financial companies can share their members’
                      personal information; the reasons Credit Union ONE chooses to share; and whether you can limit
                      this sharing.
