  * How we collect information
    * Information you involuntarily provide
    * Information you voluntarily provide 
    * Information you provide when you send us e-mail 
    * Information you provide on other forms

### Transaction Security 

When you are performing credit card transactions on the Cuesta College Web Site, you are utilizing our secure server, which encrypts all of your personal information, including name, address, and credit card number. Encryption ensures that no one can access or use your personal information. With encryption the information cannot be read as it travels over the Internet. Additionally, credit card numbers are used only for payment processing and are not retained for other purposes. We collect only the information required to process orders. When your credit card information is transmitted to our Merchant Service for validation, it is encrypted and only our Merchant Service has the key that will unencrypt that data. Please keep in mind that e-mail does not use SSL encryption technology and we advise against sending credit card information to us via e-mail. We will not be responsible for the confidentiality of any personal or credit card information transmitted via e-mail.

Our 128-bit encryption is implemented on SSL 3.0 with a certificate from Thawte, the same used by banks and brokerage houses. SSL encryption is active in all areas where credit card transaction information is requested. You can check to see that you have entered an SSL-active area by looking on the bottom of your screen. If you see an unbroken key or a closed lock (depending on your browser), you will know that SSL technology is in place and ready to encrypt your information. How to check if you are on a secure page? Look up at your address line at the top of your browser page for the (http://).  You will notice in the address line, that there is an (https://) rather than an (http://).  The (s) indicates that you are on a secure page. Also, you'll see a key (Netscape) or a closed lock (AOL & Internet Explorer). These symbols tell you that any information you send to us will be "scrambled" using SSL technology. SSL uses "Public-Key Encryption" to exchange a session key between you and our server. This session key is used to encrypt (or scramble) your transaction twice - when it is sent and when it is received. If you are using a security-enabled browser (such as Microsoft Internet Explorer version 2.1 or greater, or Netscape Navigator version 2.0 or greater), your information is secure.
