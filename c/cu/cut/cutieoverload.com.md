### Privacy Policy

Meemio Pty. Ltd. (Meemio) realizes the importance of protecting the privacy of personal information. Personal information includes all of the information provided by the customers or collected by Meemio. Meemio collects information throughout the Meemio web sites, including anonymous site statistics, domain names, and/or IP addresses.

On specific pages, Meemio gives users the option of providing names, addresses, phone numbers, fax numbers, email addresses, and other personal information. This information is gathered only with your knowledge and active permission and participation. When you complete and submit a form requesting additional information, you may be asked for personal information in order to process your request. This information will be retained by Meemio. When you send us an email, we will retain the content of the email, your email address, and our response in order to handle any follow-up questions you may have. 

Meemio has the highest regard for the privacy of its customers and other visitors to our web site. As a result, we safeguard the privacy of users of our online services with the same degree of care we protect our own information. In some instances, Meemio may review personal information (e.g., IP address logs for file transfers), while in other cases we may use the information to generate anonymous statistics. Log file analysis helps us to monitor general trends in our site traffic so that we can determine how our web site can be more effective. We will also use personal information to identify you, communicate with you, help us respond to your questions, and understand which Meemio products and services best meet your needs. 

Under no circumstances will Meemio sell personal information to any third party for any purpose. We may, however, share personal information with our business partners for the sole purpose of delivering products and services that you have requested and in order to communicate with you about Meemio, its products and services. We may also release, to the minimum extent possible, specific personal information to comply with valid legal processes such as search warrants, or court orders. 

Meemio does not store credit card numbers or bank account details of customers.
