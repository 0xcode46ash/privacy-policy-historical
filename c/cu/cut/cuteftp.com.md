# GlobalSCAPE - Privacy Policy

|   |  |    
**Privacy Policy**

GlobalSCAPE takes your privacy very seriously. All data collected is used for internal purposes only and is not provided to any third parties. In order for you to better understand our data collection methods, we have compiled the following list:

**1\. During the Download of Software.**

> When you download a copy of any GlobalSCAPE software product, we require you to provide your e-mail address. We use this address to notify you of new software releases, updates and special offers. For your convenience, each announcement contains instructions on how to be removed from all future mailings. We do not make your e-mail address available to any third parties. 

**2\. During Software Purchase.**

> It is very important for GlobalSCAPE to keep accurate purchase records. During this process, we ask for information such as name, company name, e-mail address, etc. This data is used only to identify you in order to give you the full benefits of registration including free technical support and upgrade eligibility. We do not make this information available to any third parties. 

**3\. During Software Registration.**

> Once you have purchased the software, you will be required to enter a serial number into our software. If you purchased directly from GlobalSCAPE, your information will be on file and you will only need to enter the serial number. If you purchased our software from a reseller, we will not have your information on file, and our software will prompt you for purchase information. This data is used only to identify you in order to give you the full benefits of registration including free technical support and upgrade eligibility. We do not make this information available to any third parties. 

**4\. During Trial Start** (CuteFTP and CuteMX only) 

> When you start your 30-day trial with CuteFTP and CuteMX, you will be prompted for demographic information. This does not include information that would identify you, such as name or e-mail address. This information is used to deliver banner ads that are best tailored to you and your interests. GlobalSCAPE will keep statistics regarding your use of our software, such as average sessions, average session time, daily ad displays and ad click-through. GlobalSCAPE does not monitor the content of your use of the software, such as the sites selected or files used. **Registering these programs will disable all banner ads and demographic data collection.**

**Special Notice**

> CuteFTP versions 3.0.0 and 3.0.1 inadvertently collected usage statistics after the software was registered. This was immediately corrected in 3.0.2. If you have one of these earlier versions, please [download](http://www.cuteftp.com/download/index.html) the latest version and reinstall it into the same directory. Your registration status will remain unchanged.
