We want you to know that we take your privacy seriously. We collect industry standard information to help us provide you with better software and services as described below. 

**Personal Information**   
We may ask you for personal information when you download our software, register for a trial license, purchase a permanent license, or at all of these times. For example, we may ask you for your e-mail address, your name, company name, address, and credit card billing information. 

We use your e-mail address to send registration reminders, to notify you of new software releases, updates, special offers, news, and possibly to send investor communications. For your convenience, each announcement contains instructions on how to be removed from all future mailings. 

We use your name and other personal information to identify you as a registered user in order to give you the full benefits of registration including technical support and upgrade eligibility. 

We use your credit card billing information only to obtain payment for our software. We may use your personal information to enter you in contests, such as sweepstakes, that we hold from time to time. 

You can correct factual errors in your personal information or remove your personal information by submitting a request using this [form](https://web.archive.org/support/customerservice.aspx). 

**Web Visit**  
When you visit our Web site, our server logs your IP address, the time and duration of your visit, and the time and duration of the pages on our Web site that you view. 

We will also place a "cookie" on your computer’s hard drive. A cookie is an alphanumeric identifier that is unique to your browser. This cookie will identify your browser when you visit our site again so that we may customize your visit. If you do not wish to have a cookie on your computer, check the "help" feature of your browser for instructions. Most browsers can be set to refuse cookies. 

Web visit information is used to generate aggregate statistical data that we use to measure interest in our Web pages. We may also tie this information to your personal information. 

**Web Beacons:** A Web beacon is a small image we place in our Web-based e-mail communications. Web beacons allow us to access our cookie to tell us whether you have viewed our e-mail. This information may be tied to personal information we have about you. If you set your browser to refuse cookies, the Web beacon will provide us only with information that an e-mail has been viewed, but we will not be able to identify the visit with your browser. 

**User Surveys:** Your participation in surveys is optional, although we may require your participation as a condition to a trial use of our software. We may ask you to describe the ways in which you and your company manage your IT resources or your experience with our software or Web sites. We may also ask you for demographic information such as age, gender, or areas of interest. We use this information to help us improve our software, plan marketing initiatives, and develop new products that may interest you. We may tie this information to other personal information that we have about you. 

**Shopping Cart:** We use cookies to identify you as a previous visitor to our Web site and keep track of items in your shopping cart. We may tie the cookie to any personal information we have about you. 

**Software Reporting:** The software includes a feature which assigns a unique number to your computer based on system information. The software reports this number to us when you use the Software during the trial period. The Software may also identify and report to us your Windows language identifier setting, IP address, and the date and time of program use. We use this information to count the number of installations, measure frequency of use, detect piracy of our software, and develop rough statistical data regarding the geographic location of our users. If you register our software, we may tie this information to any personal information that we have about you. 

**Purchase:** In addition to obtaining your name and other personal information, we will identify and log your browser type when you purchase our software online. We use this information to help us detect piracy of our software. 

**Web Survey:**   Your Web Survey results are collected and transmitted to you by our server.  The results and certain statistics regarding the results are stored on our server for the purpose of facilitating the reporting features of the software.  We do not view the results or statistics or share that information with any person.

**Sharing of Information with Third Parties**  
We will not disclose your personal information except as follows: 

  * To protect GlobalSCAPE and others. We may release personal information and IP addresses when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law, to enforce our software licenses and other rights, or to protect the rights and safety of others. This may include exchanging information with law enforcement agencies, or with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.
  * To persons who help us provide our products and services to you. We may provide personal and other information to third parties who work for us, such as companies that verify credit card information, process credit card payments, fulfill orders, provide customer service, analyze customer data, remove repetitive information from customer lists, and provide marketing services. We do not permit these persons to use this information for any other purpose.
  * As part of a sale of our assets or a merger of our company. We may in the future sell all or part of our assets or be involved in a merger. It is customary for user information to be included with the transferred assets in these types of transactions.
  * To the Bureau of Export Administration. We are required by law to furnish a report to the United States Bureau of Export Administration stating the names and addresses of all non-U.S. businesses or organizations (but not individual consumers) who purchase online or register any of our software that contains an encryption feature. This includes CuteFTP Pro, the GlobalSCAPE Secure FTP Server, and CuteZIP.



We may send promotional messages on behalf of other companies. If we do this, we will not provide them with your personal information. 

We do not share your personal information with third parties under other circumstances. If we ever wish to share your personal information with third parties under other circumstances, we will give you a chance to opt out before we do so. 

We may share non-personally identifiable aggregate statistical information about our users with third parties. 

**Security**   
Your credit card information is encrypted before transmission over the Internet through the use of a security protocol known as Secure Sockets Layer, and we have security measures in place to protect your personal information that we maintain here. 

**Children's Online Privacy Protection  
**Neither our Web sites nor our products are designed for or directed to children under the age of 13, and we will not intentionally maintain information about anyone under the age of 13.
