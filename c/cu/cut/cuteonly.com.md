# CuteOnly Privacy Policy

  
**Privacy Policy**

At CuteOnly, we are firmly committed to protecting your privacy.

**1\. Automatically Gathered Information**

We use your IP address and cookies. IP is the series of numbers associated with the network you come from. This information does not disclose your personal details!

We need it to maintain our Web site and collect geographical statistics of our visitors. Cookies are small text files that web sites place on your hard drive to identify you when you come back. We use cookies to deliver a content specific to your interests and to measure the effectiveness of CuteOnly advertisements on other Web sites. The use of cookies is a common practice on the Internet. You can disable all cookies through your browser settings. 

**2\. Information We Ask You to Provide for Us**

Any identifying information you give us that is not visible to other visitors, such as your email address or surname, will be kept private. We never share this information with other companies without your permission. Whenever we ask you for information, we make it absolutely clear whether it is visible to other users or not.

**3\. Your Correspondence**

All your interaction with other CuteOnly users as well as with the CuteOnly team is strictly confidential. It will never be used for purposes of research or advertising without your permission.

**4\. Non-Identifying Information**

Non-identifying information is used to help other users find your personal profile. We may also use this information in the future to research any improvements our service may need.

**5\. Financial Security**

Credit card information is processed by [2Checkout.com](http://www.2co.com/), one of the largest and most recognized credit card processing companies on the Web. Card numbers are transmitted directly to the banking network for authorization. 2Checkout.com does not record your card number and our staff has no access to this data. The sensitive information goes to the 2Checkout.com web server. Next, this information is encrypted with secure socket layer technology (SSL). SSL is what ensures complete security during the payment process. 

**6\. Mailings**

CuteOnly uses your email address to send mailings from time to time. The purpose of mailings are: 

* Notifications on new messages sent to you by other community members
* New member profiles, preferrably matching your criteria
* To recover your password and other types of notifications
* Other types of notifications, promotions and service announcements.

Our support team may contact you to assist you with your membership.

Our payment provider, 2Checkout, uses your email address to notify you on operations such as regular credit card charge.

CuteOnly does not sell rent your email address and other personal information for any kind of promotional mailings to third parties.

To access or manage your subscriptions, please visit [www.cuteonly.com/manage_subscriptions](http://www.cuteonly.com/manage_subscriptions)

The instructions to unsubscribe from our mailings are located in the bottom of the messages we send. Usually, these are both a link to unsubscribe with a single click and the email address to send an empty message to.
