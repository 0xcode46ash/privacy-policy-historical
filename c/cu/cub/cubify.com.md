# Privacy policy | Cubify

Last updated: April 7, 2014

Cubify is committed to protecting the privacy of its web site users, and preventing unauthorized use of the information it collects. Below please review an outline of our privacy policy:

We take your privacy very seriously and will never sell, share, or otherwise disclose any of your personal information to anyone except in the three limited situations described below. Information that we collect is used only to enhance your experience on our web site and for troubleshooting purposes. 3D Systems may share certain personal information in the following three situations:

1

If you join the 3D Systems Community at [Cubify.com](http://cubify.com/), other users will be able to view the information that you opt-in to sharing, such as your User ID, photo, zip code, links to the content you have posted, and the like.

2

If you participate in the 3D Systems blog at [Cubify.com/blog](http://cubify.com/blog), other users will be able to view your User ID and your posts. Your User ID may also receive messages directly from other users.

3

If you purchase a 3D printed object, such as a figurine, that includes copyrighted content licensed from a third party, we reserve the right to share, with only the third party content owner, your information (including your name, mailing address, email address, and IP address, but never your credit card or payment information) provided during your purchase. Such third party content owners will not have the right to share your information with any other third party.

The demographic information collected is used to process orders and to provide a more personalized purchasing experience.

Cubify.com may contain links to other sites. 3D Systems is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such web sites.

When an order is placed, Cubify uses the contact information in order to allow us to process and fulfill your order.

We also monitor customer traffic patterns and site usage to help us develop a web site that serves our customers' business needs.

## Google Analytics

This cookie allows us to see information on user website activities including, but not limited to page view, source and time spend on website. The information is depersonalized and is displayed as numbers, meaning it cannot be tracked back to individuals. This will help to protect your privacy. Using Google Analytics we can see what content is popular on our website, and strive to give you more of the things you enjoy reading and watching.

## Google Adwords

Using Google AdWords code we are able to see which pages helped lead to contact form submissions. This allows us to make better use of our paid search budget.

## DoubleClick

We use remarketing codes to log when users view specific pages, allowing us to provide targeted advertising in the future.

## Cookies

If you create a User ID, 3D Systems uses cookies only to store your User ID. This User ID is a string of random characters and contains none of your personal information. We use this so we can allow you to come back to 3D Systems without having to login each and every time. Once you login, we store this cookie on your system for a few days. By selecting Logout from the navigation bar at the top of our site you will have removed the cookie completely from your system, or you can let it expire on its own. 

Some pages on 3D Systems also use cookies from Google Analytics to help us figure out how our members found our website. No personal information is stored in these cookies. 

## Security

Our intent is to provide privacy, integrity, and authentication in regards to our Internet communication. The security measures we have taken are intended to secure and encrypt your data, so that a third party cannot capture, read, or access the information while it is in transit between your computer and our system. Specifically, 3D Systems uses standards-based Internet protocols to safeguard the information that you provide during the purchase, payment, and most information submittal processes. We use a secure server implementing the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol to interact with you when you provide personal information during the purchase and payment processes. These processes use 128 bit encryption.
