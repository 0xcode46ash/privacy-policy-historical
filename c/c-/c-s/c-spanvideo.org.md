                                          The C-SPAN Store Website:
                                    PRIVACY and SECURITY STATEMENT
C-SPAN is sensitive to the privacy concerns of the visitors to the C-SPAN Store website.
This Privacy and Security Statement describes the types of information collected from you, what we do with
it, with whom we share it and how it is kept secure.
Personally Identifying Information
We do not collect personally identifying information about visitors except when that information is voluntarily
offered. For example, when you make a purchase from the C-SPAN Store, we collect the following personal
information submitted by you to manage and deliver your order: (i) your name, (ii) your home and/or
shipping address, and (iii) your telephone and/or fax numbers and e-mail address. We collect additional
information if you wish to make a purchase via credit card. Typically this additional credit card information
includes: (i) your credit card number, (ii) the card's expiration date, (iii) the billing address, and (iv) the name
that appears on the card.
Our agents and contractors who have access to your personally identifiable information are required by us
to protect this information in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy and Security Statement by, for
example, not using the information for any purpose other than to carry out the services they are performing
on our behalf.
Credit Card Information
We do not use your credit card information for any reason other than to handle your purchase. We do
not provide such information to any third party. You should understand, however, that we may disclose
personally identifiable information, including any retained credit card information, in response to legal
process such as a court order or a subpoena. We may also disclose such information in response to a law
enforcement agency's request.
Security
C-SPAN uses a third-party accounting system to process all orders and credit card processing. This
accounting system provides a SAS 70 Type II audit report to its customers prepared by and audited by
a Big Four audit firm. SAS 70 refers to the "Statement on Auditing Standards (SAS) No. 70, Service
Organizations" and is a widely recognized auditing standard developed by the American Institute of Certified
Public Accountants (AICPA). This SAS 70 audit documents that the systems have been through an in-depth
audit of their control environment, including controls over data and network security, backup and restoration
procedures, system availability and application development.
Finally, you should understand that no transmission of data over the Internet is guaranteed to be completely
secure. It may be possible for third parties not under our control to intercept or access transmissions
or private communications unlawfully. While we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot
guarantee or warrant the security of any personal information you transmit to us. Any such transmission is
done at your own risk
Aggregated and Anonymous Information and "Cookies"
You should also be aware that non-personally identifying information that you provide may be automatically
collected through the use of small text files this web site uses to recognize repeat visitors. These files,


called "cookies," also assist your ongoing access to and use of the site. If you do not want information about
your visit collected by a cookie, your browser probably has a feature allowing you to block the cookie's
function. You should understand, however, that if you choose to block the cookie, you will not be able to
make a purchase from the C SPAN Store. Regardless, no information gathered through the use of cookies
will be shared with any unaffiliated third parties.
From time to time we may collect statistics about how this site is being used in an effort to improve our
services to users. That information would be aggregated and would not contain any personally identifying
information about users. Accordingly, we may share this type of aggregated and anonymous information
with a variety of third parties, including our affiliates, agents, and current and prospective business partners.
This Policy Statement is made in the name of National Cable Satellite Corporation and is effective as of
December 17, 2010 and will not be changed without notifying users by means of a revised statement at
this website. This statement does not create an agreement between the C-SPAN Store and users and, as
such, does not create any legal rights for any party. National Cable Satellite Corporation is the non-profit and
tax-exempt educational corporation that owns and operates C-SPAN, C-SPAN2, C-SPAN3, WCSP-FM, C
SPAN.org, and related websites.
