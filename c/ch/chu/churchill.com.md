**Security**

Any personal data saved is held safely on our mainframe computer, with security systems preventing unauthorised access and we always ensure it is treated confidentially. For further information regarding our security provisions please see our note titled Further Security.

  
**Cookies**  


Please note that we use "Cookies" on the Site. A cookie is a software application that tracks our users' navigation of the Site and stores that information on their hard drives. This allows us to understand our users' habits and preferences which enables us to customise our services for our users to provide an enhanced user experience. We may, for example, use cookies to store registration information so that you do not have to provide it to us on subsequent visits.

  
**Further Security**  


We take security very seriously and we use one of the strongest available security systems to protect your communications with us. Whenever you fill in a form, such as a request for a quote, it is automatically protected using something called a Secure Socket Layer (SSL) between your computer and ours. SSL works in the following ways: It prevents impersonation - you can tell that you are using a genuine SSL site by the padlock symbol at the bottom of the screen. Clicking on either the padlock or the image opposite will reveal our Registration Certificate that is issued by Verisign, a leading Internet security company.* It encrypts data - as soon as your computer has recognised our computer they encrypt all information that is passed between them. Data encryption means that no one else can read or change your information as it travels over the Internet. It prevents scrambling - SSL uses a Message Authentication Code (MAC) to prevent anyone tampering with our Internet site. Your computer will always check this code before it takes a message from us. This means that if anyone tried to interfere with a message, your computer would not recognise the code and would alert you.

*There are two minor problems with Microsoft Internet Explorer. Neither problem has any effect on the actual security in force, but may make it appear to you as if it is not fully secure. Internet Explorer 4. The padlock symbol does not always appear at the bottom when it should. A full description of this error, number Q154621, is at <http://support.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/Q154/6/21.asp>.

Internet Explorer 5. If you click on the padlock symbol to view the security certificate the following message may be displayed: "This certificate has failed to verify for all of its intended purposes". The other details of the certificate shown are correct. A full description of this error, number Q233479, is at <http://support.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/Q233/4/79.asp>.
