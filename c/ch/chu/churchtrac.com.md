# Privacy Policy

We are very concerned about your privacy. This privacy statement has been created in order to demonstrate our commitment to your privacy. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for this website.

We gather basic information about you, such as name, church name, email address, mailing address, and telephone when you request information, download software, or request that software be mailed to you. _The contact information you submit is never shared with a third party under any circumstances_. The company that hosts our website may also record your IP address in order to provide us with site statistic information (i.e., the number of people who visit each page of our site).

We use the information you provide to us to send you information about our products and services. From time to time we will use the information we collected from you to supply you with information about program updates, enhancements, new product offerings, or special pricing or promotions. If at any time you wish to be removed from our mailing list, please let us know.

When you purchase a product from our website, we refer you to the Authorize.net site in order to collect payment. Authorize.net does not reveal your credit card information to us, and we never have access to this information. After you have completed the checkout process at the Authorize.net site, Authorize.net sends a receipt of the transaction to you and to us, and we are never privy to the information you provide to them.

From time to time we may ask website or ChurchTrac users to respond voluntarily to a survey in order to help us improve our products and services. Any information collected will be kept confidential and not shared with any third parties. This information is used internally for the sole purpose of providing better products and services to our customers.

Unless you request otherwise within your communication with us, we may extract brief excerpts from complimentary emails that you send for use on our website testimonials on in advertising. Your name may be used in connection with your quote to ensure the testimony's validity. In order to guarantee the authenticity and sincerity of such quotes, we do not compensate anyone for providing testimonies. You may ask us to remove a quote that is attributed to you from our web site or from our advertising at any time, and we will comply with your request voluntarily and remove it as soon as possible.

In general, we do not send email to anyone who has not purchased, downloaded, or requested a CD from us. We currently host our email list through Vertical Response, and they ensure we only send emails to customers who have opted to receive emails from ChurchTrac. To ensure your receipt of emails from us, you should add churchtrac.com to your address book or spam filter white list.

If you provide a phone number, we use this information to contact you only when you require assistance that cannot be provided through email, when you request we contact you by phone, or when we are unable to respond to your support requests via email. We will not call you for any other purpose, including sales calls. We will never share your phone number with third parties.

On rare occasions, you may encounter problems with your ChurchTrac data file that requires you to email your data file to technical support for repair. After your file has been fixed, it will be sent back to you, and any copies or emails containing your data file will be destroyed.

No personally identifiable information is transmitted during this process. If you encounter an error and choose to report this error to us, the your basic contact information is transmitted to us, along with a description of the error. This information is used to contact you to provide support for the error you encountered.

Your purchase information and customer data is not accessible via the internet. Access to your customer information (including contact information) is password protected and only accessible by a small number of senior staff at ChurchTrac. Procedures are in place to limit access to and safeguard your information.
