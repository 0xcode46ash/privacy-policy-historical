# Privacy | Church Online Platform

###  ChurchOnlinePlatform.com Privacy Policy (1/22/2014) 

ChurchOnlinePlatform.com, a website and online service owned and operated by Life.Church, knows that you care how information about you is used and shared. We hope the following statements will help you understand how the ChurchOnlinePlatform.com website will collect, use, and protect the information you provide to us on our site. 

###  What information do we collect? 

  1. **Information you provide.** When you sign up for a ChurchOnlinePlatform.com account or as an end-user of a ChurchOnlinePlatform.com account, or another Life.Church service or promotion that requires registration, we may ask you for personal information (such as your name, email address, and an account password). We may combine the information you submit under your account with information from other Life.Church services or third parties to provide you with a better experience and to improve the quality of our services. For certain services, we may allow you to opt out of combining such information. 
  2. **Life.Church cookies.** When you visit ChurchOnlinePlatform.com , we may send one or more cookies to your computer, so that we may uniquely identify your browser. (A cookie is simply a tiny text file containing a string of characters.) Accepting our cookies allows you to keep your user preferences from session to session. Although most browsers accept cookies by default, you can set your browser to refuse all cookies, or to tell you when you’re being sent a cookie. Some ChurchOnlinePlatform.com features and services may not function properly if you have cookies disabled. 
  3. **Log information.** When you use Life.Church services, our servers automatically record information that your browser sends when you visit one of our websites. These server logs may include information such as your web request, Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request, and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser. 
  4. **Other sites.** This Privacy Policy applies only to web sites and services that are owned and operated by Life.Church. Life.Church cannot regulate other sites linked from within our various web sites and services. These other sites may place their own cookies or other files on your computer, collect data, or solicit personal information from you. You should familiarize yourself with their unique Privacy Policies, should you choose to visit their sites. 



###  How do we use your information? 

When you sign up for a particular service that requires registration, we ask you to provide personal information. You may decline to submit personal information to any of our services, in which case Life.Church may not be able to provide those services to you. 

###  How do we share your information? 

Life.Church does not share your personal information with other institutions outside of Life.Church without your explicit consent. Life.Church may share your personal information only if it has a good faith belief that access, use, preservation, or disclosure of such information is reasonably necessary to (a) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request, (b) enforce applicable Terms Of Service, including investigation of potential violations thereof, (c) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues, or (d) protect against imminent harm to the rights, property or safety of Life.Church, its users or the public as required or permitted by law. 

Life.Church takes commercially reasonable steps to implement appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of data. including internal reviews of our data collection, storage and processing practices and security measures, as well as physical security measures to guard against unauthorized access to systems where we store personal data. Unless explicit permission is obtained from you, Life.Church restricts access to personal information to Life.Church employees, contractors and agents who need to know that information to operate, develop or improve our services. These individuals are bound by confidentiality obligations and may be subject to discipline, including termination and criminal prosecution, if they fail to meet these obligations. Life.Church is not responsible, however, if unauthorized access to information occurs. 

###  Data Integrity 

Life.Church reviews our data collection, storage and processing practices to ensure that we only collect, store and process the personal information needed to provide or improve our services. We take reasonable steps to ensure that the personal information we process is accurate, complete, and current, but we depend on our users to update or correct their personal information whenever necessary. 

###  Accessing and updating personal information 

When you use any Life.Church service, we make good faith efforts to provide you with access to your personal information and either to correct this data if it is inaccurate or to delete such data at your request if it is not otherwise required to be retained by law or for legitimate service purposes. We ask individual users to identify themselves and the information requested to be accessed, corrected or removed before processing such requests, and we may decline to process requests that are unreasonably repetitive or systematic, require disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning information residing on backup tapes), or for which access is not otherwise required. In any case where we provide information access and correction, we perform this service free of charge, except if doing so would require a disproportionate effort. Some of our services have different procedures to access, correct or delete users’ personal information. You are solely responsible for ensuring that any data you provide to Life.Church is complete and accurate. If we determine information you provide is not complete or accurate, we may terminate your access to the Life.Church services. 

###  Enforcement 

Life.Church periodically reviews its compliance with this Privacy Policy. When we receive formal written complaints regarding privacy issues, it is our policy to contact the complaining user regarding his or her concerns. We will cooperate with the appropriate regulatory authorities, including local data protection authorities, to resolve any complaints regarding the transfer of personal data that cannot be resolved between Life.Church and an individual. 

###  Children's privacy 

We are sensitive to the need to protect the privacy of children who use the Internet. We therefore do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13 consistent with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act. If we become aware that a child under the age of 13 has provided personally identifiable information to us through our Site, we will delete it from our files. If you are under the age of 13, please do not attempt to provide any personally identifiable information on our Site. If you are a parent or legal guardian of someone under the age of 13 whom you believe has submitted personal information to us, please contact us and we will take appropriate steps to remove the information from our files.
