# The Chronicle: Privacy Statement

### Privacy Statement

_The Chronicle_ is committed to protecting the privacy of its subscribers and other users of its online services. We follow these policies:

**E-mail addresses**

We ask subscribers who register for our online services to provide us with their e-mail addresses so we can send them a daily e-mail news briefing. We also ask for e-mail addresses from users who want to be notified about job openings in their fields.

These addresses are used only to send news and job updates and account information to those subscribers. **_The Chronicle_ never sells, rents, or lends e-mail addresses of users to anyone.**

Registered subscribers can change the e-mail messages that they receive, or stop receiving them altogether, at any time by visiting our [e-mail settings page.](https://web.archive.org/cgi-bin/circulation/users/mailinglistreset1.cgi)

Instructions for stopping e-mail notification of job openings appear at the end of each e-mail message.

E-mail addresses that we collect as part of our "e-mail this article" service are used only to provide that service. We do not share them with anyone or use them for any other purpose.

**Advertising**

_The Chronicle_ has a contract with an outside company, DoubleClick Inc., to use its technology to deliver ads on our site. This allows us to deliver ads to users according to such factors as domain name and editorial content.

_The Chronicle_ is not a member of the DoubleClick Network. Our agreement with DoubleClick specifies that information about our users may only be used to deliver ads on our site and may not be aggregated with other information collected by DoubleClick. **We do not provide any personal information, such as names, postal addresses, phone numbers, or e-mail addresses, to DoubleClick.** The only information DoubleClick receives is what is automatically passed by a Web browser, such as Internet Protocol number, domain name, and browser type.

**Cookies**

"Cookies" are bits of data sent from a Web server to a user's machine to be retrieved later for purposes of identification. **This Web site does not use cookies.** However, you may encounter cookies when leaving our site to visit an advertiser's site or another site to which we have linked.

**Postal mailing lists**

_The Chronicle_ sometimes rents its postal mailing list (but never e-mail addresses) to organizations that wish to offer products and services to its subscribers. If you do not wish to receive such mailings, please send an e-mail message to [circulation@chronicle.com.](mailto:circulation@chronicle.com) Please include your online account number or your name and address as they appear on your mailing label. That will help us to expedite your request.

**Survey information**

_The Chronicle_ may ask subscribers or other users to provide demographic or other information about themselves. This information is used to help us deliver information and advertising to users of our site. It is not shared with organizations outside _The Chronicle_ except when it is used to compile postal mailing lists for rental. Providing this information is optional.

**Financial information**

_The Chronicle_ collects financial information (usually credit-card numbers) only to bill for subscriptions or other products or services.

**Links to other sites**

This site contains links to other sites. _The Chronicle_ is not responsible for the privacy practices or content of those sites.

**Public forums**

This site makes forums (such as the Colloquy discussions and Letters to the Editor) available to its users. Please remember that any information that is disclosed in those areas becomes public.

**Modifying or canceling services**

You can modify information in our database by visiting our subscriber-services page at [http://chronicle.com/services](https://web.archive.org/services/services.htm)

You can also send an e-mail message to [help-today@chronicle.com](mailto:help-today@chronicle.com)
