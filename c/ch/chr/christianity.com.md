# Privacy Policy - Christianity.com

**PRIVACY STATEMENT**

This privacy statement discloses the privacy practices for the Christianity.com web site. If you feel that this company is not abiding by its posted privacy policy, you should first contact our customer support by writing to Customer Support, Christianity.com, P.O. Box 4876, Hayward, CA 94540 or sending an email to support@christianity.com. 

**Information Collection and Use**  
Christianity.com is the sole owner of the information collected on this site. We will not sell, share, or rent this information to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement. Christianity.com collects information from our users at several different points on our website. 

**Registration**  
In order to use portions of this website, a user must first complete the registration form. During registration a user is required to give their contact information (such as name and email address). This information is used to contact the user about the services on our site for which they have expressed interest. It is optional for the user to provide demographic information (such as religious affiliation and gender), but including such information is encouraged so we can provide a more personalized experience on our site. 

**Cookies**  
A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's hard drive containing information about the user. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on our site. Once the user closes their browser, the cookie simply terminates. For instance, by setting a cookie on our site, the user would not have to log in a password more than once, thereby saving time while on our site. If a user rejects the cookie, they may still use our site. The only drawback to this is that the user will be limited in some areas of our site. For example, the user will not be able to participate in any of our Sweepstakes, Contests or monthly Drawings that take place. Cookies can also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our site. 

Some of our business partners use cookies on our site (for example, advertisers). However, we have no access to or control over these cookies. 

**Log Files**  
We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information. 

**Sharing**  
We may, from time to time, share aggregated demographic information with our partners and advertisers. This is not linked to any personal information that can identify any individual person. 

We partner with other parties to provide specific services. When the user signs up for these services, the customer will be made aware that they are registering with a third party and any information provided to Christianity.com will be subject to this privacy statement. Information retained by the third party will be subject to their privacy statement. Information about the third party privacy policy shall be provided at the time that a user decides to use such third parties' services. 

**Links**  
This web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this site. 

**Surveys & Contests**  
From time-to-time our site requests information from users via surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information. Information requested may include contact information (such as name and address), and demographic information (such as zip code, age level). Contact information will be used to notify the winners and award prizes. Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this site. 

**Security**  
This website takes every precaution to protect our users' information. When users submit sensitive information via the website, your information is protected both online and off-line. 

When our registration form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as your address and contact information) that information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry - SSL. While on a secure page, such as our registration pages, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when you are just 'surfing.' 

While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect user-information off-line. All of our users' information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices or the offices of our contractors who are similarly bound to protect your information. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information. Our employees who have access to your individual information must use password-protected screen-savers when they leave their desk. When they return, they must re-enter their password to re-gain access to your information. Furthermore, All employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. 

Every quarter, as well as any time new policies are added, our employees are notified and/or reminded about the importance we place on privacy, and what they can do to ensure our customers' information is protected. Finally, the servers that we store personally identifiable information on are kept in a secure environment, behind a locked cage. 

If you have any questions about the security at our website, you can send an email to security@christianity.com. 

**Supplementation of Information**  
In order for this website to properly fulfill its obligation to our customers, it is necessary for us to supplement the information we receive with information from third party sources. 

For example, in order for this website to enhance its ability to tailor the site to an individual's preference, we may combine information about the purchasing habits of users with similar information from our partners to create a personalized user profile. When a user makes a purchase from either of these two companies, the companies collect and share that purchase information with us so we can tailor the site to our users' preferences. We do not sell or provide the supplemented information to any third party or to our partners. 

**Special Offers**  
We allow all new members to verify their password and username upon registration. Established members may occasionally receive information on products, services, special deals, or a newsletter. Out of respect for the privacy of our users we present the option to not receive these types of communications. Please see our choice and opt-out below. 

**Site and Service Updates**  
We also send the user site and service announcement updates. Members are not able to un-subscribe from service announcements, which contain important information about the service. We communicate with the user to provide requested services and in regards to issues relating to their account via email or phone. 

**Correction/Updating Personal Information:**  
If a user's personally identifiable information changes (such as your zip code) we will endeavor to provide a way to correct or update that user's personal data provided to us. This can usually be done at the member information page or by emailing us at support@christianity.com. 

**Choice/Opt-out**  
Our users are given the opportunity to 'opt-out' of having their information used for purposes not directly related to our site at the point where we ask for the information. 

Users who no longer wish to receive our newsletter or promotional materials from our partners may opt-out of receiving these communications by replying to unsubscribe in the subject line in the email or email us at support@christianity.com. 

Users of our site are always notified when their information is being collected by any outside parties. We do this so our users can make an informed choice as to whether they should proceed with services that require an outside party, or not. 

**Notification of Changes**  
If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on our Homepage so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If at any point we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify users by posting our intended uses on our website at least 5 days prior to our use of such information for that new purpose. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner. 

**Policies for Children Under 18 Years Old.**

Christianity.com encourages parents and guardians to enjoy the Christianity.com Network with their children. 

Christianity.com does not provide any personally identifying information, regardless of its source, to any third party for any purpose whatsoever from our guests under 18 years of age except as required to provide the third-party services offered to our users on the Christianity.com Network (i.e. those services hosted by a third party) and in such cases, only the information necessary to use such services is provided (i.e. user name and password). When a child under 18 years old registers, he or she is required to provide the e-mail address of his or her parent or guardian. Christianity.com will send each parent or guardian an e-mail alerting them to the child's registration. The parent or guardian must approve the registration (instructions will be provided in the email that is mailed to the parent or guardian) in order for the child to use any part of the Christianity.com site from which any information will be gathered.
