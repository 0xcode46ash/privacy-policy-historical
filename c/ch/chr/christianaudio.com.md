What This Privacy Policy Covers

  * This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that Hovel Audio does not own or control, or to people that Hovel Audio does not employ or manage. 



Information Collection and Use

General

  * Hovel Audio collects personal information when you register with us and when you visit Hovel Audio pages.
  * When you register we ask for information such as your name, email address and zip code. For some financial products and services we may also ask for your address, and Credit Card number. 



Information Sharing and Disclosure

  * Hovel Audio does not rent, sell, or share personal information about you with other people or nonaffiliated companies except when we have your permission, or under the following circumstances: 
    * We provide the information to trusted partners who work on behalf of or with Hovel Audio under confidentiality agreements. These companies may use your personal information to help us communicate with you about offers from us and our marketing partners. However, these companies do not have any independent right to share this information.
    * We respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims;
    * We believe it is necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of Hovel Audio’s terms of use, or as otherwise required by law.
    * We transfer information about you if Hovel Audio is acquired by or merged with another company. In this event, we will notify you before information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy. 
  * Hovel Audio may display targeted advertisements based on personal information. Advertisers (including ad serving companies) may assume that people who interact with, view, or click on targeted ads meet the targeting criteria. 
    * Hovel Audio does not provide any personal information to the advertiser when you interact with or view a targeted ad. However, by interacting with or viewing an ad you are consenting to the possibility that the advertiser will make the assumption that you meet the targeting criteria used to display the ad.



Cookies

  * Hovel Audio may set and access Hovel Audio cookies on your computer.
  * Hovel Audio may let other companies that show advertisements on some of our pages set and access their cookies on your computer. Other companies' use of their cookies is subject to their own privacy policies, not this one. Advertisers or other companies do not have access to Hovel Auido’s cookies.
