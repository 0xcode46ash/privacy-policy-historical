We also describe the measures we take to protect the security of the information and how you can contact us about our privacy practices. Our privacy practices may vary among the countries in which we operate to reflect local practices and legal requirements.

On our Web sites, you may have an opportunity to post user-generated content using social networking tools available on those sites. If you take advantage of this opportunity, remember that the user-generated content you post is available to others who visit the Web site and therefore you should have no expectation of privacy with respect to such content.

We strongly suggest you review the third parties' privacy policies if you use the relevant features.

We may also disclose information about you when we, in good faith, believe disclosure is appropriate to comply with the law, a court order, or a subpoena. We may also disclose information about you to prevent or investigate a possible crime, such as fraud or identity theft; to protect the security of our Web sites; to enforce or apply our Web sites' terms of use or other agreements; or to protect our own rights or property or the rights, property or safety of our users or others.

We also reserve the right to transfer information about you to a successor organization if, for example, we transfer the ownership or operation of one of our Web sites to another organization or if we merge with another organization. If such a transfer occurs, we will use reasonable efforts to direct the transferee to use personal information you have provided to us in a manner consistent with this policy. Following such a sale or transfer, you may contact the entity to which we transferred your personal information with any inquiries concerning the processing of that information.

**Your Rights and Choices**

You may have certain rights regarding the personal information we maintain about you. We offer you certain choices about what personal information we collect from you, how we use that information, and how we communicate with you.

You may refrain from submitting information directly to us, although doing so may impact our ability to provide the products, services, and information you request.

You may elect not to have a unique cookie identification number assigned to your computer to avoid aggregation and analysis of data collected on our Web sites. Generally, if you do not wish to receive cookies, you may set your browser to reject cookies or to alert you when a cookie is placed on your computer. Although you are not required to accept cookies when you visit our Web sites, you may be unable to use all of the functionality of our sites if your browser rejects our cookies.

We typically offer you an opportunity to choose whether you want receive certain communications from us, generally by offering an "opt in" or an "opt out," depending on applicable law, when you first provide contact information through one of our Web sites. In addition, we will include an "unsubscribe" link in each electronic newsletter or promotional e-mail we send you, so that you can inform us that you do not wish to receive such communications from us in the future.

If you are located in the European Economic Area or Switzerland, you may direct us not to share your personal information with third parties, except (i) with service providers we have retained to perform services on our behalf, (ii) in the event we sell or transfer all or a portion of our business or assets, (iii) if disclosure is required by law or legal process, (iv) with law enforcement authorities or other government officials, or (v) when we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to prevent physical harm or financial loss, or in connection with an investigation of suspected or actual fraud or other illegal activity. If you are located in the European Economic Area or Switzerland, we use your personal information only for the purposes indicated in this policy unless we have a legal basis, such as consent, to use it for other purposes. Where required by law, C.H. Robinson obtains your prior opt-in consent at the time of collection for the processing of (i) personal information for marketing purposes and (ii) personal information deemed sensitive pursuant to applicable law.

We will respond to such requests within a reasonable time and, in any case, within the time limits established by applicable law. We may ask you for additional information to verify your identity. In most cases, we will provide access and correct or delete any inaccurate information you discover. In some cases, however, we may limit or deny your request if the law permits or requires us to do so or if we are unable to verify your identify.

To update your preferences, ask us to remove your information from our mailing lists or submit a request, please contact us as specified below.

**Data Transfers**

We may transfer the personal information we collect about you to countries other than the country in which the information was originally collected. Those countries may not have the same data protection laws as the country in which you initially provided the information. When we transfer your information to other countries, we will protect that information as described in this policy.

If you are located in the European Economic Area or Switzerland, we comply with applicable legal requirements providing adequate protection for the transfer of personal information to countries outside of the EEA or Switzerland. C.H. Robinson has certified that it abides by the Safe Harbor privacy principles as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, storage, use, transfer, and other processing of personal data transferred from the EEA or Switzerland to the United States.

For more information about the Safe Harbor privacy principles, visit [export.gov/safeharbor](http://export.gov/safeharbor/).

**How We Protect Personal Information**

We maintain reasonable administrative, physical and technological measures to protect the confidentiality and security of information about you. Unfortunately, no Web site, server or database is completely secure or "hacker proof." We therefore cannot guarantee that information about you will not be disclosed, misused or lost by accident or by the unauthorized acts of others. C.H. Robinson never collects information for third party commercial marketing purposes nor does it create individual profiles or provide your information to any third party organization. C.H. Robinson will only share your information with third parties when and as you request or as otherwise required by law. 

**Use of Our Web Sites by Children Under the Age of Thirteen**

We are proud of our Web sites and we strive to ensure that they do not offend people of any age. However, unless otherwise noted on a particular site, our Web sites are not intended for children under the age of thirteen years without the permission of a parent or guardian. If you believe that a child has submitted personally identifiable information on or through our Web sites without the consent and supervision of a parent or guardian, please contact us using the information provided below so that we can take appropriate action. 

**Links to Other Web sites**

Our Web sites may provide links to other Web sites for your convenience and information. These Web sites may operate independently from C.H. Robinson. Linked sites may have their own privacy notices or policies, which we strongly suggest you review. In addition, a link to a non-C.H. Robinson Web site does not mean that C.H. Robinson endorses or accepts any responsibility for the content, or the use, of such Web site. It is up to you to take precautions to ensure that whatever you select for your use is free of such items as viruses, worms, Trojan horses and other items of a destructive nature. C.H. Robinson is not liable for the privacy practices or the content of other Web sites and to the extent any linked Web sites you visit are not owned or controlled by C.H. Robinson, we are not responsible for the sites' content, any use of the sites, or the privacy practices of the sites.

**Updates to Our Global Privacy Policy**

This Policy describes C.H. Robinson's current data protection policies and practices. We reserve the right to update it periodically and without prior notice to you to reflect changes in those policies and practices. When we do, we will post the revised version behind the link marked "Global Privacy Policy" at the bottom of each page of our Web sites. We will also indicate at the top of the policy when it was most recently updated.
