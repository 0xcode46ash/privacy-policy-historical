# Privacy Policy - The Church of Christ, Scientist

**christianscience.com** respects and protects the privacy of users.

## What information do we collect from our users and how do we collect it?

First: this site does not collect personally identifiable information about individuals except when specifically and knowingly provided by such individuals, for instance, when submitting a request for e-mail updates. We also do not use "cookies" on this site to collect or track data.

In particular, when purchasing an item (like a videocassette), you will be asked to provide contact information (like name, e-mail and shipping address) and may provide financial information (like credit card number, expiration date) to be used for billing purposes and to fill customers’ orders. If the site has trouble processing an order, this contact information is used to get in touch with you.

christianscience.com and its affiliates may use, reproduce, distribute, and display in whole or in part, in any media, with or without name attribution, the statements, questions or comments you submit through the "Contact Us" page.

We do collect anonymous, aggregated data for statistical purposes. We may use such information to help determine ways to improve our site and may share this unattributable information with our affiliates.

We do not sell, trade or rent personally identifiable information to any third parties. To protect site visitors and the general welfare, the site may release personal information when required to comply with the law or regulatory authorities.

If you have any questions or concerns regarding what is done with your information or would like such information deleted from our records, please e-mail us at [ideas@tfccs.com](mailto:ideas@tfccs.com).

## Is the information you collect about me secure?

We take every precaution to protect our visitors' information. When you submit sensitive information via the Web site, your information is protected both online and offline from unauthorized access, improper use or disclosure, unauthorized modification, and unlawful destruction or accidental loss.

When the site asks you to enter sensitive information (such as your credit card number), that information is encrypted and is protected with Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption software. All of the site's employees and data processors, having access to and associated with the processing of personal information, are obliged to respect the confidentiality of your personal information.

## What about children using your site — is their privacy protected?

Yes. In accordance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), this site does not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13 without parental consent. If it is learned that such information has been collected without parental consent, that information will be deleted from the site's database as quickly as practical or the child’s parent(s) will be contacted to obtain consent for the collection of the information.

We strongly encourage parents to get involved with their children's online usage and to be aware of activities in which they are participating.

## What about my privacy on linked sites?

This Web site contains links to other affiliated sites, which have their own privacy policies. This privacy policy applies solely to information collected by this Web site.

By using this Web site, you consent to the collection and usage of information as described in this policy. This privacy policy is subject to change without notice and such changes will be updated and reflected within our privacy statement.

If you have any questions or concerns regarding our privacy policy, please email us at [ideas@tfccs.com](mailto:ideas@tfccs.com).
