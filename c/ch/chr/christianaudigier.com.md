Our Commitment to Privacy

Please be sure to read about our Declined Transaction policies following.

ChristianAudigier.com values its customers and respects their privacy. We collect customer information in an effort to improve your shopping experience and to communicate with you about our products, services, contests and promotions. We do not sell or rent your personal information to third parties. As described in this policy, we do, however, share your information with our affiliates and under certain circumstances, with third parties that provide services on our behalf or with whom we have partnered to offer a particular product or service.

We collect information, such as name, e-mail and postal addresses, phone and credit card numbers from you when you visit our website or one of our stores, place an order online or by phone, make an in-store purchase, save your info with us online, or participate in a contest, promotion or survey. We maintain a record of your product interests and the purchases you make online or by phone and in our stores.

When you place an order or make a purchase from ChristianAudigier.com, we use your personal information to process your order, send you e-mails to confirm your order or to contact you via phone, postal mail or e-mail if we have other questions regarding your order or purchase.

To serve you better, we may combine information you give us and information about your product interest and purchases with information from third parties, including demographic information and information that is publicly available.

We want to communicate with you only if you want to hear from us. If you prefer not to receive promotional information from us, or if you do not want us to use your information to enhance your shopping experience, please let us by sending us an email customerservice@christianaudigier.com. Please be sure to include your full name and the e-mail address you used when you made a purchase from us. If you ask us to remove your name and address from promotional lists, we will maintain your name in a "do not contact" file to ensure that we can honor your request. It may take up to 10 days to process your e-mail request, and 6-8 weeks to process your postal mail request, during which period you may continue to receive communications from Christian Audigier.

Please also note that when you purchase from us, we will continue to confirm your order by e-mail. In addition, we may also need to contact you via phone, e-mail or postal mail with other questions regarding your order.

Protecting your order information is important to us. We use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology to protect your online order information as it is transmitted over the Internet.

Declined Transactions

Unfortunately, some credit card transactions are declined. This is most often due to discrepancies in the information entered on the order. Internet-based transaction systems are very sensitive to the accuracy of the information entered for the transaction. Should your order be declined, be sure to verify the following:

1\. The billing address and shipping address match the billing address on your credit card. Corporate credit card holders may need to inquire about where the credit card statements are billed to;

2\. Be sure that the Security Code (CVV code) on the back of your card has been entered, and that it has been entered correctly;

3\. For international orders, spell out your address explicitly and without abbreviations;

4\. Be sure that you are not missing any information on the form, such as last name or zip code;

5\. Be sure that the zip code you entered is correct;

6\. Be sure that you have enough available credit on your account

If your transaction is still declined, please email us for assistance, at [customerservice@christianaudigier.com](mailto:customerservice@christianaudigier.com) . DO NOT EMAIL YOUR CREDIT CARD NUMBER TO US.

Credit Holds and Releases

When our transaction system requests approval for your order, an electronic request is submitted to the bank that issued your credit card. Often, a bank will issue an approval code for the transaction to our system even though the zip code and/or address or card code you entered is incorrect. When our verification system receives the approval and the status of your address, zip code or card code match, it may decline the order due to a code, address or zip code mismatch. The reason is that the order must pass our Fraud Protection Filters to protect you from unauthorized transactions. The result may be that your bank still is holding funds against your credit limit though your order has been declined by our system. We do not have control over the period of time in which your bank keeps the hold and when they release the hold on your account. This varies greatly between financial institutions. We cannot request that a financial institution release a hold due to the way in which member banks operate. If your transaction has been declined and your bank indicates it is issuing a hold, we recommend waiting two business days before contacting your bank about the status of the hold. By this time, most all holds are released.

Our transaction policies and procedures have been designed to provide you with the best protection against unauthorized transactions on your account. While at times they may inconvenience the cardholder, we would rather protect your safety than risk shipping an unauthorized order against your account without your approval.

We appreciate your patronage and understanding.
