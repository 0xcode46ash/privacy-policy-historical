### What information do we collect?

This website uses [Google Analytics](http://www.google.com/analytics/) to analyze visitor data and traffic to the site. This information helps us better understand our audience, and hence helps us improve the website as a whole. When you visit a page, the assets for that page are sent to you along with a small piece of data called a 'cookie' which tracks interactions with the website. Google Analytics **does not** collect any personal information about website users, we don't share any analytics data with third parties, and we enable the `_anonymizeIp` analytics setting so that your exact location is not stored or tracked.

We may also use Google Adsense on some pages to monetize our content in order to pay for server costs. Third party vendors, including Google, use cookies to serve ads based on a user's prior visits to the website. Google's use of the DoubleClick cookie enables it and its partners to serve ads to users based on visits to this site and/or other sites on the Internet. Visitors can opt-out of DoubleClick cookies for interest-based advertising, if they so wish, using Google's [Ads Settings](https://www.google.com/settings/ads).
