**Our Commitment to Security**.  We believe we have in place the appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and help prevent unauthorized access, maintain data security and correctly use the information we collect online as well as offline. If, based on your opt-in or other election, personal information is passed on to non-affiliated companies, to the extent practical, we endeavor to require that such non-affiliated companies have in place the appropriate safeguards, but we cannot guarantee that they do so.
