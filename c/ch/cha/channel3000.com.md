In such cases, we need to provide your personally identifiable information to them. 

While **Channel 3000** will seek to require such third parties to follow appropriate privacy policies and will not authorize them to use this information except for the express purpose for which it was provided, **Channel 3000** does not bear any responsibility for any actions or policies of any third parties.

**What about kids?**

Naturally, the safety of children is very important to us. Kids should always ask parents for permission before sending personal information to Channel 3000, or to anyone online for that matter. Parents, please keep in mind that the personal information we gather from children under the age of 16 is used for editorial and feedback purposes, or for any purposes specifically described when the information is collected. 

**CHILDREN:** Be sure to ask your parents for permission before you send any information about yourself (your name, address, e-mail address, etc.) to us or anyone else over the Internet, and before making any purchases online. 

**PARENTS:** We encourage you to get involved with your children’s online activities and to be aware of the activities in which they are participating. Any personally identifiable information collected by **Channel 3000** from children (that we are aware are children) will be used only for **Channel 3000** internal purposes such as market research, sweepstakes fulfillment, and for fulfilling requests for information or materials, and may sometimes be included in our database. However, such information will not be posted or published by us, or provided to any third parties, without your prior consent. Additionally, anonymous aggregated data is sometimes provided to other companies with which we do business, for statistical and market research purposes as described above. Finally, you should be aware that if your child voluntarily discloses his name, e-mail address, etc. on various forums or chat areas, such disclosure may result in unsolicited messages from other parties. Accordingly, you should discourage your child from doing so.
