# Privacy Policy - ChargePoint

Privacy Policy

### Effective Date: September 26, 2012 

ChargePoint® has created this privacy policy to demonstrate its commitment to the privacy of its customers and users. This privacy policy applies to this website, including the portion of the website accessed by ChargePoint customers and users (collectively, the "Web Site"), and the service offered by ChargePoint, including through use of the ChargePoint Smart Cards (the "Service"). By using this Web Site and the Service or by transmitting information to us by email or other electronic means, you agree to this privacy policy.

### 1\. Changes to Privacy Policy 

We may change and update this privacy policy from time to time, so you should check back to this page for the updated policy. For any significant changes affecting your personally identifiable information, we will post a more prominent notice to the Web Site of the change. If you disagree with any change, you must stop using the Service. Otherwise, we will consider your continued use to be acceptance of the change.

### 2\. Information Collection and Usage 

ChargePoint collects different kinds of information through the Web Site and the Service, and uses this information in different ways. 

Non-Personally Identifiable Information. When you visit the Web Site we collect certain demographic information (such as your IP address, type of Internet browser and operating system you use, pages viewed, the URL that you visited before you came to our Web Site, and the URL to which you next go) in order to understand how users navigate through the Web Site and to improve your experience using the Web Site.

Personally Identifiable Information. If you sign up for the Service, use the Service, or send email or other communication to ChargePoint, we may retain those communications in order to process your inquiries, respond to your requests and improve our Web Site and Service. In registering for the Service, we need to get some information from you (like name, title, e-mail address, telephone number, credit card or other means of payment, etc.). When using the Service, you may be asked for additional information to help identify you. All of this information used to specifically identify you is called "User Information" in this privacy policy. We only collect User Information that you provide to us or have given us permission to collect.

When you use our Service, we collect certain demographic information (such as your ChargePoint charging station location and charging duration) in order to understand usage patterns and to improve your experience using our Service.   
We use the User Information in order to process the application, to provide the Service to the customer and users and to otherwise communicate with you as a customer or user regarding the Service. Please keep in mind that we reserve the right to send you certain communications relating to your use of the Service, such as service announcements, notices about new features or information on the Service, administrative messages and communications regarding your account, without offering you the opportunity to opt out of receiving them.

We also may use the User Information to provide advertisements from ChargePoint or its partners to you, but you will have the opportunity to opt-out of these communications. From time to time, you may receive offers through ChargePoint from other businesses. These offers may require you to provide information to them if you choose to accept their offers. You should remember that these offers are made by the businesses themselves and not by ChargePoint. You should always be sure to read the terms of service and privacy policies of these businesses before providing any information to them so that you can understand their intended uses for your information. ChargePoint may receive information from these regarding your response to their offers so that ChargePoint may better tailor your user experience.

From time to time, we may also collect information via online surveys or polls. Participation in these surveys or polls is entirely voluntary and you may easily decline to participate.

Aggregated Information. ChargePoint may also analyze and compile information on patterns of usage of the Service. This information is collected in aggregate form, without identifying any user individually. We may use this information to improve the Service and provide this information to third parties for marketing purposes.

Cookies. Like most websites, we also use cookies to provide users an efficient experience in using the Web Site. A cookie is a small data file that certain web sites write to your hard drive when you visit them. A cookie file can contain information such as a user ID that the site uses to track the pages you have visited, but the only personal information a cookie can contain is information you supply yourself. A cookie cannot read data off your hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites. Some parts of the Web Site use cookies to track user traffic patterns. ChargePoint does this in order to determine the usefulness of the Web Site information to our users and to see how effective our navigational structure is in helping users reach that information. ChargePoint does not correlate this information with data about individual users, nor does it share this information or sell it to any third party.

Children’s Privacy. The Web Site and the Service are intended for adult users, and ChargePoint does not knowingly collect personal information from anyone under 13 years of age.

### 3\. Information Sharing

We generally do not share with any third party User Information in a way that would personally identify you. However, we may do so in the following circumstances:

  * (a) as part of a merger, acquisition or any form of sale of some or all of ChargePoint assets or business,
  * (b) to our service providers and other contractors for the purposes of providing Service to us (such contractors are prohibited from using User Information for any other purpose),
  * (c) for bill collection;
  * (d) to resolve customer disputes or inquiries;
  * (e) in the unlikely event of insolvency, bankruptcy or receivership in which your personal information would be transferred as one of ChargePoint’s business assets; and
  * (f) where we are legally obligated to disclose information to the government or third parties for the purposes of national security, law enforcement or other issues of public importance.



We may aggregate information and data about you and your use of the Web Site and Service and provide such aggregated information and data to advertisers and for marketing or promotional purposes. In these circumstances, we do not disclose information that could be used to personally identify you.

Access by ChargePoint, its distributors, ChargePoint charging station owners, or authorized third parties, or their respective employees and consultants to any personal information you provide is limited to only information necessary to provide the business service offered and to allow employees or consultants to perform their duties.

### 4\. Security Measures 

To help protect the privacy of the data you transmit through the Web Site or Service, ChargePoint uses industry-standard; secure server software that encrypts the information you input before it is sent to us. In addition, ChargePoint uses standard industry practice to protect User Information against unauthorized access. However, you should keep in mind that the Web Site and Service are run on software, hardware and networks, any component of which may from time to time require maintenance or experience problems or breaches of security beyond our control and for which we are not responsible.

### 5\. Links to Third-Party Websites

This Web Site may contain links to third party sites. Access to any other Internet site linked to this Web Site is at the user’s own risk and ChargePoint is not responsible for the accuracy or reliability of any information, data, opinions, advice or statements made on these sites. ChargePoint provides these links merely as a convenience and the inclusion of such links does not imply an endorsement.

### 6\. Accessing Your User Information

We will try to update your User Information as we become aware of changes. However, we will be able to serve you best if you update your User Information or notify us of any changes to (or errors in) your User Information. You can update your User Information through the Web Site or if you are unable to access that information for any reason, you may submit a written request for changes to Customer Service at the contact information listed below.
