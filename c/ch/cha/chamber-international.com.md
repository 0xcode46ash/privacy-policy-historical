# Privacy policy

This page explains how [www.chamber-international.com](https://web.archive.org/), uses any information you give to us, and the ways in which we protect your privacy. 

**The Data Protection Act**

Under the Data Protection Act, we have a legal duty to protect any information we collect from you. We use leading technologies and encryption software to safeguard your data, and keep strict security standards to prevent any unauthorised access to it. We do not pass on your details to any third party unless you give us permission to do so.

**What information do we collect?**

We may collect three kinds of information from visitors to [www.chamber-international.com](https://web.archive.org/): registration information, feedback (through emails to the administrator) and site usage information (from log files).

**1 Registration information**

You do not have to register to use [www.chamber-international.com](https://web.archive.org/), but you do need to register to take part in discussion forums and other interactive web media that may appear on the site. The registration information we collect is: your username (which does not need to be your real name), a password, a postcode (if you wish to give us one) and your email address. We store this information securely and keep it so that you do not need to re-register when you come back to the site. This information is also stored on back-up tapes to avoid loss of data. We do not use this information to trace your identity and do not pass it on to any third party.

We welcome your feedback. Contact us by [email](mailto:info@chamber-international.com?subject=Enquiry%20from%20Privacy%20Policy%20%20page%20on%20Chamber%20International%20website). If you send an email or letter to the administrator, asking for information, we may need to contact other departments to find that information. Once we have replied to you, we keep a record of your message(s) for reference purposes.  
We use log files which allow us to record visitors' use of the site. We analyse log file information from all our visitors, which we use to make changes to the layout of the site and to the information in it, based on the way that visitors move around it.  
Log files do not contain any personal information and they are not used to identify any individual patterns of use of the site.

**What happens when I link to another site?**

[www.chamber-international.com](https://web.archive.org/), contains links to other websites. This privacy policy applies only to our site, so you should always be aware when you are moving to another site and read the privacy statement of any site which collects personal information.  
We do not pass on any personal information you have given us to any other site.

**Access to your information and contacting** **[www.chamber-international.com](https://web.archive.org/)**
