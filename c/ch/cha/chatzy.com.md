# Chatzy - Privacy Policy

By using Chatzy's services, you consent to the collection and use of your information as outlined in this policy, as well as to our general [Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/?terms).

### General principles

|   
---|---  
  
We respect the privacy of our users to the fullest:

  * Chat contents is considered confidential and will never be sold or given away to third parties.
  * Email addresses are used only once each time they are entered and only for the purpose of sending out email invitations for a chat.
  * Chat rooms are considered private and are not monitored by moderators.



### What information is collected and why?

|   
---|---  
  
In addition to information required for the functioning of the system, Chatzy saves information such as time of day, browser type and browser language with every chat. This allows us to track the number of users and their characteristics in order to improve our service.

IP addresses are recorded for the purpose of preventing misuse, such as the sending out of chat invitations without the intension to chat with the recipients.

Chatzy uses cookies to store user preferences and to track the number of users. Chatzy is, however, 100% functional without cookies, i.e. you may disable them on your computer and still use Chatzy.

### With whom do we share information?

|   
---|---  
  
As mentioned, chat contents is considered confidential and will never be sold or given away to third parties.

Likewise, information about individual chat users, such as IP address, email address, number of visits, etc. is only used for inhouse analysis.

If, however, we receive complaints from recipients who have been deliberately harassed by email invitations, we will let them know the IP address of the person responsible for these invitations. The decision of whether such a complaint is valid or not will be taken solely at our discretion.

### Changes to the Privacy Policy

|   
---|---  
  
Chatzy may decide to change this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we do, we will post those changes on this page.
