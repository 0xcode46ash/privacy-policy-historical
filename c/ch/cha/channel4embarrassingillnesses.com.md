# Privacy Policy - Channel 4 - 4viewers

**What is this privacy policy for?**

Channel 4 is committed to protecting your personal information, being transparent about what data we hold and giving you control over how we use it.

The purpose of this privacy policy is to give you a clear explanation about how Channel 4 uses personal and behavioural information we collect from you when you use our websites and mobile sites such as channel4.com, mobile applications such as Channel 4 News or applications such as 4oD on any other devices (e.g. PS3 and Xbox) - collectively called our "Digital Products and Services".

This is the main privacy policy for Channel 4's Digital Products and Services. However, some of our Digital Products and Services may have additional privacy policies so you should read these when you register or subscribe to these services. It is important for you to read this policy in full to understand what information we hold about you, how we may use it and how you can access, update and delete your personal information. However, if you don't have time to read the whole policy now, here are the main reasons we collect different types of information about our users:

  * To help us monitor and improve our Digital Products and Services; 


  * To provide you with a more personalised experience, such as making programme recommendations or telling you when a programme you might like is available to watch on 4oD. 


  * To send you details about our Digital Products and Services, where you have signed up to receive such marketing communications. 


  * To help sell online advertising space. Channel 4 is able to put this advertising revenue back into the free services we provide to you. 



  
To be able to do these things, it's important we collect and analyse data including who our viewers are and how they use our Digital Products and Services.

**Should I read any other information or terms?**

Whenever you use our Digital Products and Services, information may be collected through the use of cookies so you should read our [Cookies Policy](http://www.channel4.com/4viewers/cookies) for more information about this. You should also see our [Viewer Promise](http://www.channel4.com/4viewers/viewer-promise), which sets out Channel 4's general approach to data.

If you're interested in the legal stuff, we recommend visiting the Information Commissioner's Office website ([www.ico.gov.uk](http://www.ico.gov.uk/)). The ICO regulates data protection and e-privacy in the UK so there is lots of useful guidance about this on their website.
