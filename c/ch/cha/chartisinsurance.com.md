# Privacy Notice

This website, located at [www.chartisinsurance.com](http://www.chartisinsurance.com/) (the “Website”), provides customers with a gateway to services offered by Chartis Inc.  and its subsidiaries and affiliates ( collectively “Chartis”, “we”, “our” or “us”).   Our address is 175 Water Street, 17th Floor, c/o Chief Privacy Officer,  New York, NY 10038. Our data collection and use policies with respect to visitors to the Website are set forth in this statement (the “Policy”). By using this Website, you signify your acceptance of this Policy. 

What is “personally identifiable information”? When reviewing this Policy you should understand that when we use the term “personally identifiable information”, we mean any information that can be used to identify or contact a specific individual, such as a name, address, telephone number or e-mail address. When we refer to “aggregate information”, we mean information that does not allow us to identify or contact a specific individual, such as demographic information, purchase categories, or visitors using a particular browser to access the Website. 

What types of personally identifiable information does Chartis collect on the Website? We collect various types of personally identifiable information from visitors to the Website.  For instance, visitors may choose to become a member of the Website (the “Member”) in order to receive special e-mail offers and promotions available only to Members. To become a Member, visitors are required to sign up by providing their e-mail address, and other contact and product-related questions we may ask from time to time. We also collect information through Chartis InfoExchange and our “contact us” forms. When you submit questions or comments through the Chartis InfoExchange or such forms, we may collect personally identifiable information such as first name, last name, e-mail address, telephone number, policy number and the question or comment you submitted.  That information is sent to us in the United States. For your convenience, we may allow you to log into your broker account through the Website.  Please be aware that your login information is collected by the particular application to which you are logging in, and not by the Website.  As such, the collection, use and disclosure of your login information is governed by the privacy policy applicable to the particular application to which you are logging in, and not by this Policy.  Please review the privacy policy applicable to such application for more information. We may collect Social Security Numbers in the course of their business.  We maintain privacy and security policies and procedures that protect Social Security Numbers by maintaining their confidentiality, prohibiting their unlawful disclosure, guarding against unauthorized access, establishing proper disposal procedures for them (such as shredding) and limiting their disclosure to third parties, except where required or permitted by law. 

Does Chartis collect any other information about visitors to the Website? We constantly seek to maintain the integrity of, and make improvements to, the Website. As part of these efforts, we collect and analyze certain aggregate information about how visitors use the Website, as stated below. When you visit our Website, we may collect various types of technical data including, but not limited to, domain and/or Web browser information. This data is gathered using cookies and other similar technologies. Cookies are small pieces of information that our server places on a visitor’s computer hard drive to enable that person to more easily communicate and interact with the Website and to provide us with important information on how visitors use the Website. This Website uses cookies to allow you to select a preferred location view and default home page view and to let you access recently visited links more easily. Many Web browsers are automatically set to accept cookies. You may change your browser settings to either reject cookies or notify you when a cookie is about to be placed on your computer. Please note, however, that rejecting cookies while visiting the Website may result in certain parts of the Website not operating correctly or as efficiently as if they were allowed. You will not be able to access a preferred location view, a customized default home page view or your recently visited links. In addition, we may use a service that collects data remotely by using so-called “pixel tags,” “web beacons,” “clear GIFs” or similar means (collectively, “Pixel Tags”) embedded in the Website’s content. A Pixel Tag is an electronic image, often a single-pixel (1x1), that which is ordinarily not visible to Website visitors and may be associated with cookies on the visitors’ hard drives. The data we collect includes which operating system and browser you use, how you navigate to and through our site, and how long you stay on our web pages. This information is anonymous and does not include your name, e-mail address or any other contact information. Please note that certain aggregate information may be linked with personally identifiable information. Any such linked information will be treated as personally identifiable information for the purposes of this Policy as long as it is so linked. 

What does Chartis  do with personally identifiable information collected on the Website? We will use personally identifiable information provided by visitors to fulfill the purpose for which such information was provided, as described in this Policy, or as disclosed at the time the visitor information is collected. We use the information submitted via the Chartis InfoExchange to respond to your inquiry.  We will not use the information submitted to the Chartis InfoExchange for marketing purposes, nor share it with any third party for marketing purposes, unless you consent to this use. We also may use the information submitted to ask you follow-up questions about which products you have purchased or are considering purchasing, in order to improve our services and better understand your needs. We may store the information you submit via the Chartis InfoExchange for such period of time as may be necessary, in our discretion, to resolve your inquiry or as may be needed/helpful to  Chartis. We may also offer visitors the opportunity to receive special promotions. If a visitor elects to receive such offers by becoming a Member, we will use the information provided by that visitor to send those offers. We also may use personally identifiable information or IP addresses to provide you with customized content on our Website or to provide you with information most relevant to you. 

Can I “opt out” of receiving e-mail promotions from  Chartis?  If you change your mind about receiving promotional e-mails or electronic newsletters, you may choose not to receive such communications from us by: (1) following the “unsubscribe” instructions in the specific e-mail from which you wish to opt-out or (2) sending an e-mail to [reply@chartisinsurance.com](mailto:reply@chartisinsurance.com), specifying the particular e-mail list(s) from which you wish to be removed. We will honor your request made pursuant to these methods as promptly as practicable. Even if you elect to stop receiving promotional e-mails from us, we may still contact you to tell you important information about the Website or us. 

Does Chartis share personally identifiable information with other companies? We will not intentionally share your personally identifiable information with unaffiliated entities except: (1) as described in this Policy or as disclosed at the time your personally identifiable information is provided; or (2) with your consent. We work with third parties who provide services to us, and we may share your personally identifiable information with third parties, including without limitation: website hosting or email hosting or information technology consulting services, marketing and promotion services, newsletters, data analysis, legal services, accounting services, and other administrative and back-up and security services. We may also disclose personally identifiable information in order to: (1) comply with applicable laws; (2) respond to inquiries or requests from government or public authorities; (3) comply with valid legal process; (4) protect our rights, privacy, safety or property, Website visitors or the public; (5) permit us to pursue available remedies or limit the damages that we may sustain; and (6) enforce our Terms of Use. In the event there is a change in the corporate structure  Chartis, including, but not limited to, merger, consolidation, sale, liquidation or transfer of substantial assets, we may, in our sole discretion, transfer, sell or assign information collected on and through this Website, including without limitation, personally identifiable information concerning visitors, to one or more affiliated or unaffiliated third parties. 

What does Chartis  do with aggregate information collected on the Website? Because aggregate information collected on the Website does not personally identify you, we may use aggregate information for any purpose, and share aggregate information with third parties for any purpose. We share the information gathered using cookies, Pixel Tags and other similar technologies with our third party vendor, WebSideStory. WebSideStory gives us reports of this aggregated data. We use this data to improve our site by responding to our users’ interests and providing more relevant and useful information. For example, we use aggregate information collected on the Website to evaluate how the Website is being used. In addition, we may collect and analyze information about how many visitors arrived at certain pages of the Website, how long they stayed on those pages, and where they went afterwards. This information allows us to determine which pages might be the most interesting to and popular with visitors and enables us to provide visitors with a better and richer experience on the Website. For example, we may use certain aggregate information to improve the performance of our Website. To learn more about WebSideStory’s privacy standards and use of web beacons, please visit: <http://www.websidestory.com/privacy/privacy-policy.html>. In addition, we may share statistical information derived from the information submitted via the Chartis InfoExchange with third parties; however, such statistical information is not associated with any individual in a personally identifiable manner. 

If I link to another site and provide information to that site, how will that information be handled? This Website may contain links to other websites. The operator of such other website (whether Chartis or a third party) may collect information about you, including through cookies or other technologies. If you link to another site, you will leave this Website and this Policy will not apply to your use of and activity on those other sites. If you provide personally identifiable information through any such site, your transaction will occur on that site (not this Website) and the personally identifiable information you provide will be collected by, and controlled by the privacy policy of, that site’s operator. Links on this Website to other websites are provided only as a convenience, and the inclusion of such links does not imply endorsement of the linked site. We encourage you to read the legal notices posted on those sites, including their privacy policies. We shall have no responsibility or liability for your visitation to, and the data collection and use practices of, such other sites. This Policy applies solely to online information collection and use practices in connection with this Website; it does not apply to any practices conducted offline or in connection with other websites owned or operated by any third parties. 

What information can third parties collect through the Website? We may use third party advertisement-serving companies (“Advertisers”) to serve advertisements on the Website.  Please be advised that such Advertisers may use cookies, Pixel Tags and other technologies to, among other things, enable such Advertisers to monitor which ads have been served to your browser and which Website pages you were viewing when such ads were delivered.  If you would like more information about these practices or your choices regarding the collection and use of this information by Advertisers, please visit: <http://www.networkadvertising.org/>.  PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS POLICY DOES NOT COVER THE COLLECTION AND USE OF INFORMATION BY ADVERTISERS. 

How does Chartis protect the information I provide to the Website? We take reasonable precautions to safeguard the personally identifiable information transmitted between visitors and this Website and the personally identifiable information stored on our servers. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, although we strive to protect your personally identifiable information, we cannot ensure the security of any information you transmit to us through or in connection with the Website. No method of transmitting or storing data is completely secure. If you have reason to believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure, you must immediately notify us of the problem by contacting us at [reply@chartisinsurance.com](mailto:reply@chartisinsurance.com). In the unlikely event that we believe that the security of your personally identifiable information in our possession or control may have been compromised, we may seek to notify you of that development. If a notification is appropriate, we would endeavor to do so as promptly as possible under the circumstances, and, to the extent we have your e-mail address, we may notify you by e-mail. 

Where will  Chartis  store and maintain information about me? We maintain this Website in the United States.  Further, please note that any communication you send to a “chartisinsurance.com” e-mail address will necessarily be routed through the United States.  By providing personally identifiable information and other information to this Website, and/or by sending a communication to a “chartisinsurance.com” e-mail address, you understand and consent to the collection, use, processing disclosure and transfer of such information to the United States and other countries or territories, which may not offer the same level of data protection as the country where you reside, in accordance with the terms of this Policy. 

Can Chartis  change this Policy? Yes. We reserve the right to change this Policy in order to address future developments of  Chartis, the Website or changes in industry or legal trends. Depending on the nature of the change, we will either: (1) announce the change on the home page of the Website or (2) take such other action as we deem appropriate under the circumstances, including without limitation, posting the revised draft of this Policy on the Website. You can determine when this Policy was last revised by referring to the "Last Revised" legend at the bottom of this page. Any changes to this Policy will become effective upon posting of the revised Policy on the Internet, accessible through the Website. By continuing to use the Website following such changes, you will be deemed to have agreed to such changes. If you do not agree with the terms of this Policy, as it may be amended from time to time, in whole or part, please do not continue using this Website.
