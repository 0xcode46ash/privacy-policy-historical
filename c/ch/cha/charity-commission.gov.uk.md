### Database right statement for the Register of Charities

Crown database right 2001. The Central Register of Charities ("The Register") is subject to Crown database right.

**You may:**

1\. access the Register and download insubstantial extracts from it onto electronic, magnetic, optical or similar storage media. The repeated and systematic downloading of insubstantial parts of the contents of the Register may amount to the downloading of a substantial part of those contents

2\. download the contents of the Register for the purpose of illustration for teaching or research, providing there is no commercial purpose

3\. download all or a substantial part of the contents of the Register containing factual information of any description for any purpose which does not involve making all or a substantial part of those contents available to the public by any means

These are the permitted uses. Any other proposed use of the Register and its contents would require a licence. The Director of the Office of Public Sector Information (OPSI) in their role as Queen's Printer has been appointed by Her Majesty the Queen to manage all copyrights owned by the Crown on Her Majesty's behalf. You can apply for a licence to:

The Commission has a statutory obligation to permit the inspection by any member of the public of the information entered on the Register, and to provide, on request, and on payment of any prescribed charge, copies of entries on the Register. The Commission also has a statutory obligation to permit such inspection of the accounts and reports which are sent to it, and of the trusts of charities which are entered on the register. Again, it has to provide copies on request, and on payment of any prescribed charge.

The Commission is not in a position to control the use which people make of information which it is legally required to provide to them.

#### Acceptable use of Charity Commission Searchable Databases

The Charity Commission searchable databases are designed to meet the needs of a wide range of users wishing to interrogate our information on-line.

Due to limitations of equipment and bandwidth, they are not intended to be a source for bulk downloads. Although downloading all or a substantial part of the contents of the register for a purpose which does not involve making the contents available to the public would not be an infringement of Crown database right, it does cause heavy demands upon the system. Persons wishing to obtain an electronic copy of the whole register or a substantial part of it should follow the Commission's procedure for [obtaining an electronic copy](https://web.archive.org/about-the-commission/freedom-of-information/copies-of-the-register-and-other-documents/ "Copyright - Register of Charities").

Individuals, companies, IP addresses or blocks of IP addresses who generate unusually high numbers of daily database accesses, whether generated manually or in an automated fashion, may be denied access to these services without notice. In such cases they should follow the Commission's procedure for [obtaining an electronic copy](https://web.archive.org/about-the-commission/freedom-of-information/copies-of-the-register-and-other-documents/ "Copyright - Register of Charities").

### Disclaimer

We have tried to ensure that all information we provide through this web site is correct at the time we included it. We apologise for any errors. We therefore do not guarantee the accuracy of these pages and any visitor using information contained in them does so entirely at their own risk.

### Privacy Policy

This explains how www.charitycommission.gov.uk, uses any information you give to us via our website, and the ways in which we protect your privacy. (NB It is not intended to be a privacy statement in relation to information submitted to the Commission by any other means.)

#### The Data Protection Act 1998

The Charity Commission is a Data Controller under the Data Protection Act 1998. We hold information for the purposes of maintaining the Register of Charities and certain other statutory functions as assigned by Parliament. The Commission complies with the data protection principles set out in the Data Protection Act 1998 in relation to personal data which you give to us via our website to the extent that the Act requires it to do so. These principles restrict the powers of a data controller to disclose to third parties personal data which it is processing.

#### What information do we collect via the website?

We collect four main types of information from visitors to www.charitycommission.gov.uk:

  * feedback (general questions and specific feedback on the website);
  * notification of changes to entries on the Charity Commission's Register of Charities;
  * representations on Schemes and Orders; and
  * site usage information (from our own and third-party cookies).



#### 1\. Feedback, questions and comments

You can send us your comments to our email feedback address or from our website questionnaire.If you send an email or letter to us or call us for information, once we have replied to you, we keep a record of your messages for three months for reference and audit purposes, after which it is deleted.

#### 2\. Representations on Schemes

You can make comments or representations about a scheme that the Commission is making for a charity by email. A form is available for this purpose. We must take into consideration any representations that we receive within the statutory period of notice. We may decide as a result that the proposals need to be changed.

We will retain a hard copy of your representation. This will be dealt with in accordance with the Commission's record retention policy.

#### 3\. Notification of changes to entries on the Charity Commission's Register of Charities

Email requests to update or correct details displayed on the online Register of Charities are generally dealt with by our Charity Database division. The types of changes they deal with include changes to correspondent and website or e-mail contact details for a charity. The division also deals with amendment of charity financial details, area of operation, classifications etc.

Anything that could indicate a change to the operation of the charity (affecting its governing document, name, objects, area of benefit etc) is forwarded to our Register Maintenance division for them to consider.

All e-mails requiring our action are printed off and a hard copy is retained on the division for internal audit purposes. These are held for 6 months and then destroyed. This is slightly longer than the official retention period of three months for Register Check forms (which updates similar details). E-mails are deleted once the item is actioned.

We will confirm that the requested changes have been made if you specifically request us to do so.

#### 4\. Site usage information

We record traffic to our site using third-party cookies. These place small amounts of information on your computer or mobile phone. The information collected cannot be used to identify you personally. We collect this information to:

  * measure how many people are using our online services, so they can be made easier to use and there's enough capacity to ensure they are fast
  * analyse anonymised data to help us understand how people interact with Charity Commission services so we can make them better



We also use cookies to give you control over the way our site works, for example:

  * enabling a service to recognise your device so you don't have to give the same information several times during one task
  * recognising that you may already have given a username and password so you don't need to do it for every web page requested



You can set up your browser to refuse cookies but this means we will be unable to display certain pages such as the Welsh version of our site and provide other accessibility options. Our cookies policy provides more information on how cookies work and how to manage them.
