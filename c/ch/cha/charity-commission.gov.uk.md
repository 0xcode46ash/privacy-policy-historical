Privacy Policy

This explains how www.charitycommission.gov.uk, uses any information you give to us via our website, and the ways in which we protect your privacy. (NB It is not intended to be a privacy statement in relation to information submitted to the Commission by any other means.)

The Data Protection Act 1998

The Charity Commission is a Data Controller under the Data Protection Act 1998. We hold information for the purposes of maintaining the Register of Charities and certain other statutory functions as assigned by Parliament. The Commission complies with the data protection principles set out in the Data Protection Act 1998 in relation to personal data which you give to us via our website to the extent that the Act requires it to do so. These principles restrict the powers of a data controller to disclose to third parties personal data which it is processing. 

What information do we collect via the website?

We collect four main types of information from visitors to www.charitycommission.gov.uk: 

  * feedback (general questions and specific feedback on the website); 
  * notification of changes to entries on the Charity Commission’s Register of Charities; 
  * representations on Schemes and Orders; and 
  * site usage information (from session cookies and log files). 



1\. Feedback, questions and comments

You can send us your comments to our email feedback address or from our website questionnaire.If you send an email or letter to us or call us for information, once we have replied to you, we keep a record of your messages for three months for reference and audit purposes, after which it is deleted. 

2\. Representations on Schemes 

You can make comments or representations about a scheme that the Commission is making for a charity by email. A form is available for this purpose. We must take into consideration any representations that we receive within the statutory period of notice. We may decide as a result that the proposals need to be changed.

We will retain a hard copy of your representation. This will be dealt with in accordance with the [Commission’s record retention policy.](https://web.archive.org/tcc/ccrecords.asp)

3\. Notification of changes to entries on the Charity Commission’s Register of Charities 

Email requests to update or correct details displayed on the online Register of Charities are generally dealt with by our Charity Database division. The types of changes they deal with include changes to correspondent and website or e-mail contact details for a charity. The division also deals with amendment of charity financial details, area of operation, classifications etc.

Anything that could indicate a change to the operation of the charity (affecting its governing document, name, objects, area of benefit etc) is forwarded to our Register Maintenance division for them to consider.

All e-mails requiring our action are printed off and a hard copy is retained on the division for internal audit purposes. These are held for 6 months and then destroyed. This is slightly longer than the official retention period of three months for Register Check forms (which updates similar details). E-mails are deleted once the item is actioned.

We will confirm that the requested changes have been made if you specifically request us to do so.
