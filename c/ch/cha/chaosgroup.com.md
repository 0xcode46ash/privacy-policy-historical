Please note that some of our sites, products and services include links to sites, products or services of third parties that have privacy practices different from ours. If you submit personal information to any of those sites or services, your information is governed by the privacy statements of those third parties. In addition, the collected personal data may (occasionally) be transferred to selected third parties, which may be located outside of the Economic European Area (“EEA”) in relation to the services provided to you by us or by our agents and distributors. By way of example, this may happen if any of our servers are from time to time located in a country outside of the EEA or one of our service providers is located in a country outside of the EEA. These third parties will not use your personal information for any other purposes than what we have agreed with them. We request those third parties to implement adequate levels of protection in order to safeguard your personal information. We respect your personal information and therefore, we will take steps to ensure that your privacy rights continue to be protected if we transfer your information outside of the EEA in this way.
