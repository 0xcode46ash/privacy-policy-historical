**What information do we collect? How will we use it?**

  * When you sign up for our newsletters, we need to know your e-mail address. This allows us to send the information you requested. After signing up, you will be transferred to a separate page asking for your name, address, phone number, e-mail address and birth date.  We gather this information only to get a better understanding of who you are and better serve you. We may use your name in order to personalize communications we have with you. 
  * When you sign up for a web-based (online) or print subscription online, we collect your name, address, phone number, payment information and e-mail address. This is done so we can send the issues to you by mail or grant you access to our online subscriber’s area.
  * Us or our partners may also use the information collected to occasionally notify you about special promotions, events and products updates, services and special offers you may find valuable. If you would rather not receive this information, please send an email to [custsvc@strang.com](mailto:custsvc@strang.com).
