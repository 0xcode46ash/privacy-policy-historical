# Privacy & Security

## Our Core Principles

Here at Chairish, we want you to be in control of your information and get the most from it. While this privacy policy is specific about how we collect and use your confirmation, we have the following core principles by which we will abide by. Even as the details in the rest of this privacy policy may change, these core principles will remain constant. 

  * Your information on the Chairish service belongs to you.
  * We will help you to control your information.
  * We will tell you what we do with your information.
  * We will never spam you or abuse your information.



## What types of information are we talking about?

  1. Information you provide to us; and
  2. Information that we collect when you use our website and Services (Services are defined in our Terms of Service). 



### Information You Provide to Us

**When you register with Chairish** , you provide us information to register and set up an account, including email, name, and billing and credit card information if you are buying or selling items (“Account Data”). We use this information to provide you the Services, send you Service related notices, including any notices required by law. 

**We also ask your permission to use your email address to send you other messages** , such as newsletters, updates to features of the Service, or special offers. If you later want to opt-out or change your mailing preferences, go to https://www.chairish.com/account/update. 

**If you correspond with Chairish** , we may retain the content of your messages, your email address and our responses. 

**If you invite a friend to try Chairish through our Service** , we will use that friend's email address for the sole purpose of sending your invitation. 

### Information that We Collect When You Use the Website and Services

**When you use the Chairish websites and services (such as this one)** , we use cookies, or similar technologies, to help us improve your experience. Specifically, any information we gather this way will only be used to analyze and improve our Services, diagnose problems, maintain security, remember information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit, and provide custom, personalized content and information. While our Services may not operate properly without these technologies, you can set your web browser to refuse all cookies. Chairish cannot personally identify you with this information alone, but if you do log into your Chairish account, we may associate this information with your account and personally identify you in order to provide you better service. 

## How We Share Your Information

**Personally Identifiable Information** : Chairish will not rent or sell your personally identifiable information to others and will not share it with others, except as follows: 

  * Chairish may disclose such information (a) if we are required to do so by law or subpoena, (b) to enforce our terms and policies; or (c) to exercise or protect the rights, property, or safety of Chairish, our users or others. 
  * We may store information in physical locations outside the direct control of Chairish (for instance, on servers or databases co-located with hosting providers). 
  * Chairish may share your information with third parties who have contracted with Chairish to provide services to Chairish solely for the purpose of providing Services to you. If we do this, such third parties' use of your information will be bound by this Privacy Policy. 
  * Chairish may transfer such information if Chairish is acquired as a business or its assets are sold, as is typical when a business is acquired or merged. 



## How We Protect Your Information

Chairish employs well-established security measures to safeguard our systems and your information. However, we cannot control all the individuals and activities on the internet and elsewhere, and therefore cannot guarantee that such information will never be compromised. 

## Links to External Servers and other Web Sites and Services

When you link to or interact with the External Servers, or other websites or services, our Privacy Policy no longer applies and you are subject to that website's or service’s own rules and policies. Please read over those rules and policies so you understand how they treat your information. 

## Notification Procedures

It is our policy to provide notifications, whether such notifications are required by law or are for marketing or other business related purposes, to you via email notice or through conspicuous posting of such notice on our web page, as determined by Chairish in its sole discretion. We reserve the right to determine the form and means of providing notifications to you. 

## U.S. Based Service

Our center of operation is in the United States. Your data is held in the United States and transactions are processed in US Dollars on servers in the United States. As such, all data is held in accordance with United States laws and procedures which differ from those in other regions of the world, such as the European Union. By using this service, you acknowledge that you understand and agree to these data policies. 

## Changes to Our Privacy Policy

If we change our privacy policies and procedures, we will post those changes on our website to keep you aware of what information we collect, how we use it and under what circumstances we may disclose it. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page. 

If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy or our data practices, please contact us at support@chairish.com. 

Thank you!
