**Privacy Statement**

Champssports.com believes in keeping your confidential information confidential. With this in mind, we have adopted the privacy policy described below, which addresses:

**Registration**  
We encourage you to register when shopping at the Champssports.com site, however it is not required. Our [registration form](https://www.champssports.com/catalog/Account_info.cfm?TID=5555-02080018042002181129787-0&NewAccount=yes) requires users to give us contact information (such as name, age range and password). **You must be 14 years of age or older to register.** Registration helps us to provide you with quick and simple checkout experience. The customer contact information you supply on the registration form will be used to contact you concerning the status of an order or to answer any of your questions. In addition, it will be used to send you e-mail updates about upcoming sales, contests, promotions and product information if you choose to opt-in.

At all times, you have the option of "opting out" of receiving future e-mail updates by sending us an e-mail with "unsubscribe" in the subject line at [customer_service@champssports.com](mailto:customer_service@champssports.com)

If you would like, you can also fill out a customer profile. While it is not required, information obtained from the customer profile questions helps us to learn more about our customers and is used to improve our customers' shopping experience with us.

**Order Information**  
**Champssports.com does not sell products for purchase by children.** We sell children's products for purchase by adults. Customers may use an order form to purchase products. When you place an order, we collect contact information, such as your shipping and e-mail addresses, and financial information, such as your account or credit card numbers. Contact information from the order form is used to send orders and information to our customers and to get in touch with them when necessary. Financial information is used to bill the customer for products. You also have the option of ordering products over the telephone and you may choose to pay by check, credit card or money order.

**Use of Information**  
Information collected by Champssports.com is used by us for three main purposes:

  2. We collect information to contact those visitors that have opted-in to receive information about upcoming sales, contests, promotions, and product information, and to participate in contests and promotions. 
  3. At times, we may share aggregate or summary information, such as statistics about our customers, sales traffic patterns and related site information, with reputable third-party vendors. However, this information will not include any personally identifiable information. 



We do not sell or share any information about our users on the individual customer level.
