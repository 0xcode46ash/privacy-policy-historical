# Terms and Conditions

**Terms and Conditions  
** **  
Your Rights  
** Chain Reaction Cycles (CRC) is a UK based company and complies with UK consumer law including the _Distance Selling Regulations_. This means that shopping with CRC is safe. You won't get ripped off, you’ll get your parts and we’ll sort out any problems you have. Our Terms and Conditions do not affect your statutory rights.

Pricing**   
Prices include VAT (Value Added Tax)* at the standard UK rate of 17.5%. VAT does not apply to orders that are to be shipped outside the E.U. or to Tax Free areas such as the Channel Islands. These areas will be priced and billed with VAT deducted. 

  
If you select a currency or a delivery country outside the E.U., prices will be displayed VAT free, for example, an item which costs 19.99 GBP will be shown and billed as 17.01 GBP when it is VAT free.   
  
While we do our best to ensure prices are up to date and correct, errors may occur and in this case you will be contacted before your order is shipped.  
  
*In the UK helmets are already VAT free, so price is not affected by delivery destination.  
 **  
Payment**   
CRC accept most major credit cards for online orders. You will be asked to enter your card details and the name and the address of the card holder when you place the order. These details will be checked and we may hold an order until we receive the correct details. You will be contacted if we find the card or address details to be incorrect. We only bill your card when your order is ready to be dispatched. 

For offline orders CRC accept (£) Sterling Postal Orders, Personal Cheques, (£) Sterling Bank Drafts and (£) Sterling Bank Transfers. We recommend that you do not send cash through the post. Due to varying Exchange Rates all payments made to CRC must be in UK Pounds (£) Sterling.   
**  
Credit Card Security  
** We take online security extremely seriously and have taken several steps to ensure that your payment information is processed confidentially and accurately. 

Chain Reaction Cycles offer the use of secure servers where information is protected by Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), the industry standard encryption technology. SSL works with Netscape Navigator, Microsoft Internet Explorer, AOL and other browsers. This encryption makes it virtually impossible for unauthorised parties to read any information that you send us. 

When your order is processed your encrypted credit card number is removed from the web server. 

This means that there is no way that someone can obtain your credit card number from CRC so you can order with confidence!

 **  
Privacy Policy**   
Chain Reaction Cycles are committed to protecting your privacy. When you make an online order, we need to know your name, e-mail address, credit card billing address, delivery address, credit or debit card number and associated details. This allows us to process and fulfil your orders and to notify you about your order status. We will also require a land line telephone number in case we need to contact you and for international orders this number may be given to our couriers in order to help with the delivery of your goods. You have trusted us by giving us these details and CRC promise not to use these details for any other reason other than processing your order or informing you about the products and services of CRC. We will not pass any of your details on to third parties for profit or otherwise.

**  
Product Availability**    
CRC updates the availability of the entire stock list on a daily basis. Items that are 'Out Of Stock' will be displayed as such. In the rare event of a problem with availability of a product marked 'In Stock', we will contact you. You may then wish to cancel the order or wait until the item becomes available.   
**  
Out of Stock Orders**   
There are times when items become temporarily 'Out Of Stock', and these items are marked as such in the site. If you order an 'Out Of Stock' product, we will send out the order to you as soon as the product becomes available again. If we cannot source the item we will contact you to inform you. Your credit card will not be debited until we dispatch the product.   
**  
Accuracy of information**   
We put a lot of time and effort into describing and photographing the products we sell using manufacturer's websites, catalogues, our own photography studio and often our own descriptions of the products. Although we aim that every picture and description is 100% accurate, mistakes do occur so let us know if you see or read something that isn’t correct. If you have purchased something based on a picture or description on the website which turns out to be incorrect we will be happy to replace or refund the product (unused).
