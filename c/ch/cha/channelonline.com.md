|  **User Data** **Collection of information**  
CNET Channel is committed to keeping your personal and organizational information private and abides by [CNET Networks Privacy Policy](http://www.cnet.com/aboutcnet/0-13611-7-811039.html?tag=st.cn.ros.ft.13611-7-811039). To provide its users with personalized services and custom data, CNET Channel collects registration information and distributors' access information from its users. **Registration information**  
When creating a new account on ChannelOnline, you are required to disclose certain customer registration information. This information includes customer contact information (name, address, phone, fax, e-mail, website, and password) and billing information (credit card information). This information is not disclosed to third parties without your consent. It is used to notify you of any system upgrades, technical support issues or other relevant information. **Distributor's access information**  
ChannelOnline requires you to provide relevant distributor information in order to display custom pricing and availability such as usernames and passwords. Any such distributor information that is particular to you is kept confidential. The information you enter about your customers while using CNET Channel's services is also kept confidential. **Sharing of information**  
CNET Channel takes the privacy of its users seriously. As a consequence, CNET Channel has a strict policy against sharing individual user data with third parties, except in certain select instances. CNET Channel may disclose or exchange user information when you have given your consent, when it is required by law, or, if necessary, to protect the rights or property of CNET Channel or its users. In certain other instances, CNET Channel will share user data with a closely integrated partner, like a distributor, in order to provide a service that a user has specifically requested, or provide limited user contact information to potential suppliers who require it in order to make their products available on ChannelOnline. CNET Channel may also obtain user consent in order to share information with individual third parties so as to generally improve its services or allow the promotion of services that may be of interest to you.  
CNET Channel reserves the right to use aggregated data to report user demographics, track sales and traffic patterns and monitor other related trends.

Any and all of your confidential transactions, between you and CNET Channel, are protected within Secure Socket Layer (SSL), the industry standard protocol for maintaining security.
