# Privacy Policy - CHALLONGE!

Your privacy is our top priority. We added the following privacy policy for some legal protection and for those who want to know the specifics regarding the use of their private information. It's a modified version of [Automattic](http://automattic.com/)'s policy which is available under a Creative Commons Sharealike license. The gist of the following is that we will only collect information that is required for the operation of Challonge.com (email address for password recovery, for example), and we will not share this information unless law requires us to do so.

  
Challonge! operates the website [Challonge.com](http://challonge.com/) and respects your privacy regarding any information it may collect.

### Website Visitors

Like most website operators, Challonge! collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Challonge!'s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how visitors use Challonge.com. From time to time, Challonge! may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of Challonge.com.

Challonge! also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. It does not use such information to identify website visitors, however, and does not disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information, as described below.

### Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information

Certain visitors to Challonge.com choose to interact with the website in ways that require Challonge! to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Challonge! gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, visitors who sign up for an account at Challonge.com provide a name and email address. Those who engage in transactions with Challonge! – by purchasing the use of tournament bracket modules, for example – are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, Challonge! collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor's interaction with Challonge.com. Challonge! does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.

### Aggregated Statistics

Challonge! may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to Challonge.com. For instance, it may monitor tournaments on Challonge.com to better understand the applications (sports, games, contests, etc.) for its tournament brackets. Challonge! may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, it does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.

### Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information

Challonge! does not disclose potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone, except when required to do so by law, or when it believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of itself or the public at large. If you are a registered user of Challonge.com and have supplied your email address, Challonge! will not send you an email unless it feels it has information specific to your account which will resolve problems you may have encountered or enhance the value of products or services you paid for. If you send Challonge! a request (for example via a support email or other feedback mechanisms), it reserves the right to publish it in order to help it clarify or respond to your request or to help support other users. Challonge! takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.
