## ChaCha Privacy Policy

We know that ChaCha users care about privacy. ChaCha shares your concern and wants you to know what information we gather and how we use it.

This notice describes the ChaCha privacy policies and practices that we use in connection with our site. For this purpose, the "site" includes all the ChaCha pages and functions that are available to the general public. By using the site, you agree to the practices and policies described in this privacy policy.

This privacy policy does not relate to ChaCha's relationship with Guides, who are the independent contractors that assist you with searches when you click the "Search with Guide" button on our site.

#### ChaCha Search Does Not Require Personally Identifiable Information

ChaCha does not require that you provide personally identifiable information in order for you to use our search service. You do not have to register to use the ChaCha search service. We do not ask search users for their name, mailing address, email address or phone numbers.

When you use our site, you can choose automated search or you can obtain search guidance and search results from a Guide. If you select use of a Guide, you can communicate in text directly with the Guide via our real time messaging functionality. Regardless of which option you choose, you are not required to identify yourself to carry out the search.

We do not encourage you to include personally identifiable information about yourself in your search queries, but you can do so if you wish.

#### Use of Anonymous Data

We use anonymous data regarding our search users. For example, to responding to your search queries, we use your IP address, browser type, and anonymous information contained in cookies. (See discussion below about cookies.)

ChaCha is supported by advertising. We aim to supply advertisements to you that are relevant to your interests. Advertisements may be selected wholly or in part on the basis of keywords that you use in searches or based on your geographic region.

We may monitor anonymous data to check for any abuse or misuse of our service.

Third party suppliers provide some of the sponsored links and unsponsored links in ChaCha automated search results. When you submit a query to us, we may pass your query on to one or more of these suppliers. We do not pass personally identifiable information about you (except such information as you might choose to include in your query). We do not control such third parties and are not responsible for their use of any information.

#### Cookies

Cookies are a commonly used technology on the Web, and they are used in ChaCha's search functionality.

ChaCha's service writes a cookie to your PC. A cookie is a small text file sent by our computer system that is stored on your PC for record-keeping purposes. The cookie remains on your hard drive until you remove it.

ChaCha does not link the information stored in cookies to any personally identifiable information. Nor do we include any personally identifiable information in the cookie on your PC. We do include in the cookie a unique number or identifier ("Anonymous ID"). The Anonymous ID serves as a tracker that allows our system to know about repeated use on an anonymous basis. ChaCha also uses cookies to track each session on our site and to determine if you are logged in.

Our suppliers of sponsored and unsponsored links and advertising may use their own cookies. In addition, when you click on a link and view a third party site, that site may also use cookies. This privacy statement covers ChaCha's use of cookies only and does not cover the use of cookies by any third parties.

Your browser has functionality that will allow you to prevent the use of cookies or to remove cookies. See your browser's "Help" file for details. Note however that disabling cookies may adversely affect your ability to use ChaCha search.

#### Query and Session Logging

Our search service automatically records (or "logs") all queries and results of all search users, including your automated search queries and your interactive sessions with Guides. Our logs do not include any personally identifying information unless you choose to include such information in your queries or your communications with the Guides. As noted above, do not require that you provide any personally identifying information.

We treat these logs as part of our anonymous data. Search log information may be used and analyzed for the same purposes as other anonymous data referred to above.

#### Your Interaction with Guides

We value Guides greatly and they are essential to ChaCha, but they are not our employees. Guides are independent contractors, and we are not legally responsible for their actions.

We instruct the Guides not to ask users for identifiable information and not to save any information from their sessions with users. We also instruct Guides to act in accordance with ChaCha's privacy policy.

We do not recommend that you provide personally identifiable information to Guides. If any Guide does ask you for any personally identifiable information or does anything else that raises a privacy concern, we urge you to report the incident to ChaCha by use of the "Contact Us" link on the ChaCha home page.

#### The ChaCha Toolbar

ChaCha has released a software ChaCha Toolbar that functions as an add-in to certain web browsers. We think you will find that the ChaCha Toolbar makes ChaCha search more convenient for you. You can download and install the ChaCha Toolbar software if you like. There are a number of sites on the web that offer the ChaCha Toolbar.

You are not required to register with us or provide any personally identifying information to download, install, or use the ChaCha Toolbar.

When you use the ChaCha Toolbar, its software will send us a ChaCha search query. It also sends us, with each search query, an identifier for the web site from which you downloaded the ChaCha Toolbar or an identifier of the ChaCha Guide who referred you to download the toolbar. We use this information to credit or provide rewards to the various Web sites or ChaCha Guides that supply our Toolbar to the public.

#### Links to Other Sites

Our Web site contains links to other sites. You may find these links in advertisements, in search results, and in other areas of our site. These links take you away from the ChaCha site. Please be aware that ChaCha is not responsible for the privacy practices of any third party sites.

#### ChaCha's Blog

ChaCha may allow you to contribute to our weblog or "blog" known as "Cha-Blog." While most postings on Cha-Blog come from Guides, our blog functionality allows members of the public to contribute. To post on Cha-Blog, our site requires that you give your name. (We suggest you supply your first name only.) The Cha-Blog functionality also allows you to link your name to a web site.

Each item of content and any link you provide for Cha-Blog is your "Public Content" and will be open to anyone that uses the Web. If you chose to provide personal identifying information in Public Content, you do so at your own risk.

#### Guide Sign-Up

There is a "ChaCha Guide Signup" page on our site, where we ask persons who want to be Guides for their email address. We may use this email address information in recruiting Guides.

#### Release of Information for Legal Reasons

ChaCha may release information concerning your use of ChaCha whenever we believe in good faith that such release is appropriate to comply with the law, to protect against fraudulent or unlawful use of the ChaCha site, to protect ChaCha's rights, systems, or property, or if ChaCha believes in good faith that there is a situation involving any abuse, threat, or harmful conduct.

#### Access from Outside the United States

Our system stores and processes information in the United States of America. The data protection and privacy laws the United States may not be as protective as those in other countries, including, in particular, those in the European Union. By use of our service, you expressly consent to the transfer of any information you provide to the United States for use in accordance with this policy.

#### Changes in Our Privacy Policy

If ChaCha decides to change its privacy policy, ChaCha will post the changed version on ChaCha's site. We cannot provide any other notification of change, so please check back from time to time.

#### Feedback Form

ChaCha has feedback functionality on our site that allows you to submit comments, suggestions, bugs found or any other information. ChaCha asks for your name, and email address in order to follow up with you or thank you for a suggestion. It is not our policy to use this information for other purposes. We do keep this information so that we can track whether problems or issues recur.

#### Business or Asset Transfer or Sale

As ChaCha continues to develop its business, ChaCha might sell or buy businesses or assets of businesses or ChaCha might merge with another business. In such transactions, stored data and information generally is one of the transferred business assets. Also, in the event that ChaCha, a product or product line of ChaCha or if substantially all the assets of ChaCha are acquired, stored data and information may well be one of the transferred assets. If ChaCha decides to undergo such a transaction, ChaCha will post information regarding the change of possession on ChaCha's web site.

#### Children Under 13

In accordance with the Federal Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 ("COPPA"), ChaCha will not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13. If you are under 13, you should not use any function or service of our site that allows you to provide any personally identifiable information.

#### Security

We have a firewall and other security measures. However we do not warrant or guarantee our information security.
