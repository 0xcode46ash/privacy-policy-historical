# Privacy and Cookie Policies | Chatham House

## Who we are

Chatham House, the Royal Institute of International Affairs, is an independent policy institute based in London. Our mission is to help build a sustainably secure, prosperous and just world.

Chatham House is comprised of both a charity and a trading company. In this policy wherever you see the words ‘ **we** ’, ‘ **us** ’ or ‘ **our** ’, it refers to both our charity and/or our trading company.

Our trading company is wholly owned and controlled by our charity. Any information we collect may be used by both our entities. Our trading company exists as a separate legal entity so that we can hold our conferences and provide some limited consulting services.

  * Chatham House (The Royal Institute of International Affairs), registered charity no. **208223**. Our main trading address is 10 St James’s Square, London SW1Y 4LE. Our VAT number is **653 2181 53**.
  * Chatham House Enterprises Limited, registered company no. **2979061**. Our main trading address is 10 St James’s Square, London SW1Y 4LE. Our VAT number is **653 2181 53**.



Both our charity and our trading company are registered as data controllers with the Information Commissioners’ Office under the Data Protection Act 1998:

  * Chatham House Enterprises Limited: registration number **Z1808673**.

## Where we store your personal data/Transferring your data outside the EEA

We aim to ensure that there are appropriate physical, technical and managerial controls in place to protect your Data. Within our offices, all of our staff receive training on handling data security.

Where we use external companies to collect or process data on our behalf, your Data may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the European Economic Area (" **EEA** "). It may also be processed by staff operating outside the EEA who work for us or for one of our suppliers. Such staff may be engaged in, among other things, the provision of support services.

The purpose for such transfers can be a combination of a number of things: the costs of data storage may be lower in countries based outside the EEA; our support teams may be based there (again, usually for reasons of cost; or one of our subsidiary companies which deal with your Data may be based outside of the EEA.

However, we will meet our obligations under the legislation by ensuring that the information has the same protection as if it were being held within the EEA because our hosting company either benefits from the Privacy Shield or has entered into model EU clauses with any sub-processor it uses and based outside the EEA or has established a set of binding corporate rules with its foreign subsidiaries who are based outside the EEA or the Information Commissioner has made a positive finding of adequacy in relation to the territory in which the sub-processor is based and to which your Data may be transferred .

We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your Data is treated securely as we do and in accordance with this privacy policy.

Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access certain parts of our Site, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share a password with anyone.

Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our Site; any transmission is at your own risk.

Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access.

## Sharing your personal information with third parties

We may share your personal information to any member of our group, which means our subsidiaries, our ultimate holding company and its subsidiaries, as defined in section 736 of the **UK Companies Act 1985**.

We may also share your Personal Information with third parties in the following circumstances:

  * In the event that we sell or buy any business or assets, in which case we may disclose your Personal Data to the prospective seller or buyer of such business or assets. In that event, we will attempt to notify you prior to the event and offer you the chance to cease use of the Services and remove your information from our database where we are able to contact you and you require its deletion. In any event, we will endeavour to ensure that your rights and freedoms in respect of the processing of your personal data are adequately and appropriately protected
  * If we or substantially all of our assets are acquired by a third party, in which case Personal Data held by us about you will be one of the transferred assets
  * If we are under a duty to disclose or share your personal data in order to comply with any legal obligation, or in order to enforce or apply our terms of use and other agreements; or to protect the rights, property, or safety of Chatham House (The Royal Institute of International Affairs), our customers, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organisations for the purposes of terrorism, fraud protection and credit risk reduction
  * When acting as agents and data processors carrying out work on our behalf such as fulfilment companies, event partners or program funders. Where we enter into a relationship with an external party, any such arrangements will be subject to a formal agreement between Chatham House and that organization to protect the security of your data
  * Hotels, airlines and travel agencies should Chatham House arrange your travel and accommodation, for example if you are an invited guest speaker for one of our events
  * Subject to prior consent, we may use third party wealth screening and insight companies to provide information about your net worth and your potential level of donation.



The Purposes of transfer of your Data (save in the case of Sensitive Data, where we will have obtained your specific consent to do so for one or more of the Purposes) are lawful because it is necessary for us to hold and use your Personal Data so that we can perform our obligations under the contract we have entered into with you for the Purpose(s).

In the event of any of the above scenarios occurring, we will endeavour to ensure that your rights and freedoms in respect of the processing of your personal data are adequately and appropriately protected.

We will not sell your data to any third party.

## Your rights

 **Withdrawing your consent**

You have the right to ask us not to process your personal data for marketing and donation request purposes. We will usually inform you (before collecting your data) if we intend to use your data for such purposes.
