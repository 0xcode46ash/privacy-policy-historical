# Charlie App | Privacy Policy

_Effective as of October 22, 2014_

Your privacy and data security are important to us. As users of countless applications ourselves, we know how important it is to trust the apps and websites we all use. As a result, we abide by strict internal processes developed to maintain your data in a secure environment.

Charlie uses social data to provide you with information (a “briefing”) on people and companies. We pull information from LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook, Google, and other sources to give you the best possible user experience. Where data is unreachable without user authorization, we ask users to grant us limited access to their accounts.

The purpose of this Privacy Policy is to explain (1) what data we collect from you, (2) how we use your data, and (3) who we share your data with.

## What and Why

We collect and use the following information to provide, improve and protect our Services:

#### Personal Information

We may collect, and associate with your account, information like your name and email address.

#### Connected Accounts

When you use Charlie, you may grant us access to third-party applications like Gmail or LinkedIn. We query, store, process, and transmit information related to your Connected Accounts. When using data from connected accounts, we distinguish between

  *  **Public data,** which is information that users have chosen to make public on the Internet, and which anyone can find using one of the major search engines. We aggregate public data, take into account corrections and feedback, and show this information to everyone who uses Charlie.
  *  **Private data,** which is privileged information to which only you have access. In order to provide users briefings, we may need to process this data (only as listed in the “With Whom” section; however, the private data itself will never be displayed to any other Charlie user unless you explicitly ask us to.



#### Usage

We collect information from and about the devices you use to access the Services. This includes things like IP addresses, the type of browser and device you use, the web page you visited before coming to our sites, and identifiers associated with your devices. Your devices (depending on their settings) may also transmit location information to the Services.

#### Cookies and Pixel Tags

We use cookies and pixel tags to provide, improve, protect and promote our Services. For example, cookies help us with things like remembering your username for your next visit, understanding how you are interacting with our Services, and improving them based on that information. You can set your browser to not accept cookies, but this may limit your ability to use the Services.

## How

#### Research

We access your Connected Accounts to research the people and companies you meet with. For example, we use your LinkedIn account to lookup and show any common connections you have with a person.

#### Deletion

If you delete your account, we will delete all of your personal information and private data. This includes information associated with your account, your calendar information, emails, and your briefings. Please note: (1) there might be some latency in deleting this information from our servers and back-up storage; and (2) we may retain this information if necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, or enforce our agreements. To delete your account, contact us at [support@charlieapp.com](mailto:support@charlieapp.com).

#### Security

We have team members dedicated to keeping your information secure and testing for vulnerabilities. We also continue to work on features to keep your information safe. However, while we attempt to protect all information you send to us and we maintain to provide Charlie to you, please note that no connection through the Internet and data storage facilities are entirely immune from unauthorized hacking and access, and so you should use Charlie with discretion. You can help us by protecting your username and password and using Charlie only through secure networks.

## With Whom

Your private data will be kept secure and private as detailed above. It may need to be processed by other people or third party purposes. We will only share such information for the following purposes.

#### Others working for Charlie

For quality and technical support purposes, select Charlie employees may review your data. These employees will access your information only to perform tasks on behalf of and in compliance with this Privacy Policy.

#### Service Providers

Charlie uses trusted third party cloud service providers to help us provide, improve, protect, and promote our Services (for example, Google Analytics uses cookies to help us understand how users interact with the Charlie website). These third parties will access your information only to perform tasks on our behalf and in compliance with this Privacy Policy.

#### To others you explicitly ask us to share to

Upon your request to share briefings with other people, we can send briefing information to the people you specified on your behalf.

#### Anonymized & Aggregated Data

We may share aggregated or otherwise non-identifiable information, like Charlie usage statistics. For example, we may write a blog post using statistics like “The average engineer takes most meetings in the morning.”

#### Law & Order

We may disclose your information to third parties if we determine that such disclosure is reasonably necessary to (a) comply with the law; (b) protect any person from death or serious bodily injury; (c) prevent fraud or abuse of Charlie or our users; or (d) protect Charlie's property rights.

Stewardship of your data is critical to us and a responsibility that we embrace. We believe that our users' data should receive the same legal protections regardless of whether it's stored on our services or on their home computer's hard drive. We'll abide by the following principles when receiving, scrutinizing and responding to government requests for our users' data:

  * Be transparent,
  * Fight blanket requests,
  * Protect all users, and
  * Provide trusted services.



## Changes

If we are involved in a reorganization, merger, acquisition or sale of our assets, your information may be transferred as part of that deal. We will notify you (for example, via a message to the email address associated with your account) of any such deal and outline your choices in that event.

We may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time, and will post the most current version on our website. If a revision meaningfully reduces your rights, we will notify you.

## International

If you use or access Charlie from a country outside the United States, you understand and agree that your information will be collected, maintained and processed on servers located both in and outside the United States.

## Children

Charlies is not intended for or directed to children under the age of 13. If we become aware that someone under the age of 13 has provided their personally identifiable information, we will promptly delete that information.
