ChannelAdvisor will take reasonable steps to ensure that such information is relevant to its intended use, accurate, complete and current.  ChannelAdvisor will offer Users the opportunity to choose (opt-out) whether their personally identifiable information is to be disclosed to a third party or used for a purpose other than the purpose for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized by the User.  For sensitive personally identifiable information as described in the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles (as defined herein), ChannelAdvisor will provide Users the opportunity to affirmatively and explicitly (opt-in) consent to such use.

We use this information to understand how the Services are being configured and used, how they can be improved for the benefit of Users, and to develop new Services.

**Other Disclosures.**  ChannelAdvisor may disclose a User’s personally identifiable information if required to do so by law or if ChannelAdvisor has a good faith belief that such disclosure is necessary to protect and/or defend the rights and interests of ChannelAdvisor or others. ChannelAdvisor may, as permitted by applicable law, disclose your personally identifiable information to ChannelAdvisor Clients, other Users or third parties in connection with an investigation of fraud, infringement, piracy or other unlawful activity and you expressly authorize ChannelAdvisor to make such disclosures.

**Domestic and International Use.**  All personally identifiable information collected by ChannelAdvisor may be: (1) used in the United States; (2) transferred to the United States for use of the Services by a foreign ChannelAdvisor Clientif the Services are undertaken by ChannelAdvisor for a Client; or (3) transferred to a ChannelAdvisor location or Client outside of the United States.

**V.   USE AND DISCLOSURE OF PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION FROM SHOPPERS AND CHANNELADVISOR CLIENTS**

**Bidding and Buying Process.  **If you are a Shopper, we share personally identifiable information about you with that ChannelAdvisor Client in order to assist you with the bidding and buying process as well as to assist ChannelAdvisor Clients with the selling process. ChannelAdvisor will retain your information at ChannelAdvisor to support the transaction. To the extent that ChannelAdvisor Clients or ChannelAdvisor’s agents have access to a Shopper’s personally identifiable information, these entities will treat this information in no less a secure manner than they treat the personally identifiable information of customers who purchase directly through the website of that ChannelAdvisor Client. If you are a Shopper, you are encouraged to review the privacy policies of the ChannelAdvisor Clients and/or websites that provide the products or services related to your bid or purchase. Shoppers should contact these ChannelAdvisor Clients and/or websites directly and review their privacy policies should you have questions concerning their use of your information such as, for example, communications you may or may not wish to receive.

**Customer Support.**  Contact information provided by a Shopper in connection with problems, comments or requests is used only to respond to those problems, comments or requests and may be provided to ChannelAdvisor Clients or third parties as necessary to respond to the comment, problem or request.

**Marketing/Special Offers/Solicitation from ChannelAdvisor.  **ChannelAdvisor may use a Shopper’s information to provide updates and for other business purposes related to making available the features and functions of Services. ChannelAdvisor also may use information a Shopper provides to make a Shopper aware of new products or special offers or promotions. ChannelAdvisor will abide by requests from you to discontinue such use.  As a Shopper, if you receive communications directly from a ChannelAdvisor Client, you should contact the ChannelAdvisor Client directly concerning such communications and review their privacy policies.  A Shopper will receive such information as described in this Section unless a Shopper has opted out of receiving such information from ChannelAdvisor as part of the checkout process.  Outside of the checkout process, Shoppers may also opt out of receiving such information (if you have not already opted out of receiving it) by sending a request as described below.

**Providing Your Information to Third Parties for Marketing/Solicitation (Shoppers).  **If you are a Shopper, Channel Advisor does not sell your personally identifiable information to third parties for purposes of marketing or soliciting you, provided however, we may share personally identifiable information with a third party upon your prior consent (opt-out).  To the extent that ChannelAdvisor Clients (for example, a seller of an item you purchased) have access to your personally identifiable information as a result of your bidding or buying, where ChannelAdvisor provides your information to ChannelAdvisor Clients as part of a transaction you may be involved in with such ChannelAdvisor Client, these entities may solicit or market to you in accordance with their policies. As a Shopper, you are encouraged to review the privacy policies of the ChannelAdvisor Clients that provide the products or services related to your bid or purchase. You should contact ChannelAdvisor Clients directly and review their privacy policies should you have questions concerning their use of your personally identifiable information such as, for example, communications you may or may not wish to receive.

**Providing Your Information to Third Parties for Marketing/Solicitation (ChannelAdvisor Clients).  **If you are a ChannelAdvisor Client, ChannelAdvisor may provide certain of your registration information to third parties for use in marketing and in designing or providing their own services, to send you information about its products and to notify you if you win a contest. You may opt out of ChannelAdvisor providing such information to third parties at any time by updating your Personal Account Settings or by contacting ChannelAdvisor. You should contact the third party directly who may already be sending you messages in order to request that these communications stop, and to review their privacy policies.

ChannelAdvisor may retain transactional history in order to document a transaction you may have had with a ChannelAdvisor Client. You should contact the ChannelAdvisor Client (for example, the seller of an item you have purchased) directly in order to access, modify or update your personal information with them.
