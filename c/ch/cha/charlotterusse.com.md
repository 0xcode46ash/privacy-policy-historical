**Information We Collect**

When you visit the Charlotte Russe, Inc. Website, we collect customer information to improve the content of our Website for marketing and promotional purposes. Each time you visit our Website, our Web server automatically recognizes your IP address, monitor resolution and what type of browser you are using. We collect the e-mail addresses of those who communicate with us via e-mail, and collect customer information gathered in the course of joining our online member base and/or processing sales transactions. We do not gather any personally identifying information about you when you visit this Website, unless you choose to provide such information to us.

We may use third-party advertising companies to serve ads on our behalf. These companies may employ cookies and action tags (also known as single pixel gifs or web beacons) to measure advertising effectiveness. Any information that these third parties collect via cookies and action tags is completely anonymous.

**Children**

We do not knowingly collect or use any personal information from children (minors younger than 13 years old). If you are a parent and believe we may have inadvertently collected such information from your child, please notify us immediately by sending an e-mail to customersupport@charlotterusse.com or phoning us toll free at 1-866-896-7568.

**Cookies**

When you view our Website, we may store some information on your computer's hard drive. This information will be in the form of a "Cookie." Cookies enable us to establish the shopping cart session and allow you to purchase items on-line at our Website. Most web browsers automatically accept Cookies, but you can usually change your browser to prevent that. Without accepting a Cookie, you can browse through our Website, but you will be unable to establish a shopping cart session and make a purchase on-line. For further information, please view our Terms of Use.

**Security**

The Website makes every effort to protect your online order information by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology. SSL encrypts your order information to ensure it remains private and secure. To check the security of your connection, look at the lower left-hand corner of your browser window after accessing the server. If you see an unbroken key or a closed lock (depending on your browser), then SSL is active. You can also check by looking at the URL line of your browser. When accessing a secure server, the first characters of the Website will change from "http" to "https".

Some browsers and firewalls do not permit communication through secure servers. In that case, you will be unable to connect to our server so you will not have to worry about mistakenly placing an order through an unsecured connection. If you can't access the server, you can place your order by calling our Customer Service Representatives at 1-866-896-7568.
