2 - COLLECTION AND USE OF NON-PERSONAL INFORMATION

The ads.chartboost.com and www.chartboost.com websites (Chartboost Sites) use cookies. A "cookie" is a small text fle that contains a string of alphanumeric characters. There are two types of cookies that may be used at the Chartboost Sites: a persistent cookie and a session cookie. A persistent cookie gets entered by your Web browser into the "Cookies" folder on your computer and remains in this "Cookies" folder after you close your browser. Persistent cookies may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the site. A session cookie is held temporarily in your computer?s memory and disappears after you close your browser or shut off your computer. Chartboost Sites may also use Web beacons (also called "clear GIFs" or "pixel tags") in conjunction with cookies. Web beacons are small strings of code that are placed in a Web page.

If you have arrived at this website by clicking on a banner ad for one of our products or services, a session cookie may be used. This cookie will contain an identifcation number for the ad that you clicked on, or will contain an identifcation number for the site that you were visiting when you clicked on the banner ad. This session cookie helps Chartboost's Marketing Department determine which of our ads attract the most visitors. If, after you arrive at our site, you choose to request further information from us about our products and services, the personal information that you provide in that request will be linked to the information in the session cookie. This also helps Chartboost's Marketing Department measure the effectiveness of our advertising. This "linking" will not be used to target future advertisements to you or to send you emails about future goods and services. You will receive emails about our products only if you tell us on the product request page that you want us to send them to you. Because this is a session cookie, it will disappear once you have closed your browser. If you return to our site via another one of our ads, you will appear as a new visitor unless and until you provide further personal information.

Chartboost Sites may use persistent cookies, Web beacons and information collected in our log fles (such as Internet Protocol Address, referring URLs, etc.) about your activity at this site to better understand how the website is used, resolve technical problems, and enhance your experience at this site. Information from website analysis cookies or about website usage is not combined with information from any other Chartboost cookie. We use a third-party email technology to send emails that you have agreed to receive. Web beacons are used in those email messages to measure the effectiveness of our advertising.

In addition, Chartboost may serve ads on this and other websites using our own ad serving technology. In doing so, one of our ad servers will place or read a unique ad-serving cookie on your computer and will use non-personal information about your browser and your activity at this site to serve ads on this and other sites. The ad serving cookie is a persistent cookie.

3 - INFORMATION SHARING OR DISCLOSURE

In the event that we contract with a third party to provide some part of the information or service that you have requested, Chartboost may provide your information to such third party, or such third party may collect information from you on our behalf.

When we serve text and display ads on certain Chartboost services and Chartboost partner sites and apps, those ads may be served based on a variety of factors including: the content, domain, and language of the page or app where the ad is displayed; and the standard log information described above. To serve ads that are relevant and tailored to your interests, we may use information about your activity on Chartboost partner sites and apps or Chartboost services that use the Chartboost system. Some of these sites, apps and services also may use non-personally identifying information, such as demographic data, to provide relevant advertising. Our Chartboost partners and Chartboost services may display ads from both Chartboost advertisers and other third-party ad serving companies, including other ad networks, provided they comply with Chartboost's third-party ad serving requirements.

When we serve an ad to you, we may generate a cookie based on your mobile device?s unique identifer, which is a permanent number assigned to your device by its manufacturer or carrier partner. A cookie is a text fle, consisting of a series of random numbers and letters that serves as a pseudonymous identifer for your browser, but does not identify you. We use cookies or other technologies to record information about what ads you are shown, as well as what ads you click and other actions you take on our sites, apps and services. Cookies allow us to serve more relevant and useful ads to you. The following describes how our cookies work to support our advertising services and conversion tracking, and how you can opt out of generating these cookies.

5 - ADVERTISING COOKIES

The Chartboost Cookie

Chartboost uses the Chartboost cookie on Chartboost partner sites and apps and certain Chartboost services to help advertisers and publishers serve and manage ads across the web. When you use an app and view or click on an ad served through these apps, we may generate the Chartboost cookie and associate it with your device.

You may view and manage your advertising preferences or opt out of the generation of the Chartboost cookie at any time, as described below.

How we use the Chartboost cookie information

We use the advertising cookie information collected on Chartboost partner sites and apps and certain Chartboost sites and apps to:

  * Enable the following ad serving features: 
    * Frequency Capping: Prevents users from seeing the same ad over and over again;
    * Spam fltration: Uses cookies as one of many signals that allow us to identify invalid clicks (or ad queries) and to protect our advertisers from fraudulent behavior;
    * View-Through Conversions: Provides insight to advertisers on how many people who were exposed to an ad, didn?t click, but subsequently visited the advertiser?s website;
    * Interest-Based Advertising: Allows advertisers (including Chartboost) to serve ads to users on Chartboost partner apps and certain Chartboost apps and services based on online activity and interests associated with the Chartboost cookie and to serve subsequent ads to you after you leave that advertiser?s website.
  * Audit, research, and analyze the data in order to maintain, protect, and improve our services;
  * Ensure that our ad-serving technologies function properly; and
  * Develop new services.



The advertising cookie information described above is provided to advertisers and publishers who use our advertising services. In addition, Chartboost or our advertising and publishing customers may use web beacons in conjunction with the Chartboost cookie to collect information about your exposure to a particular advertisement.

Chartboost will not combine Chartboost cookie information from Chartboost partner apps or Chartboost services that use the Chartboost cookie with:

  * Your personally-identifying information without your opt-in consent; or
  * Information collected by Chartboost's advertising customers without their explicit permission. With such permission, Chartboost may use and combine that information only in accordance with the Chartboost Privacy Policy.



6 - MANAGING YOUR ADS PREFERENCES

Chartboost strives to provide you with relevant and useful advertising. Based on activity on our Chartboost partner sites and apps and Chartboost services that use the Chartboost cookie, we may associate the cookie with relevant interest categories. Chartboost then uses these categories to show interest-based ads on these sites and apps. Chartboost will not associate sensitive interest categories with the Chartboost cookie (such as those based on race, religion, sexual orientation, health, or sensitive fnancial categories) and will not use these categories when showing you interest-based ads.

7 - CONVERSION TRACKING

Chartboost also uses a cookie to measure advertising performance for advertisers who have opted-in to conversion tracking on Chartboost and its Chartboost partners. The conversion tracking cookie is generated when a user clicks on an ad delivered by Chartboost where the advertiser has opted-in to tracking. These cookies expire within 30 days and are not personally-identifable. If this cookie has not yet expired when the user visits certain pages of the advertiser?s website, Chartboost and the advertiser will be able to tell that the user clicked the ad and proceeded to that page. Each advertiser gets a different cookie, so no cookie can be tracked across advertiser websites and apps.

How we use the conversion cookie information

We use the information collected by the conversion cookie to provide aggregate conversion stats to advertisers who have opted-in to conversion tracking. Advertisers are able to see the total number of users who have clicked on their ad and proceeded to a page tagged with a conversion tracking tag, but they do not have access to personally identifying information.

8 - PRIVACY POLICIES OF OTHER ADVERTISERS AND PUBLISHERS

Chartboost requires customers that display Chartboost ads to comply with all applicable laws, including data protection laws that require posting a privacy policy. We encourage all users to review the privacy policies of sites and apps they visit for information about those sites? data practices.

Chartboost has implemented reasonable security measures in order to protect both personal and non- personal information from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration or destruction. While we cannot guarantee that loss, misuse or alteration to data will not occur; we make every effort to prevent such occurrences.

10 - COMPROMISE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION

In the event that your personally identifable information is compromised as a result of a known or suspected breach of security, we will promptly notify those persons whose personal information has been compromised, in accordance with the notifcation procedures set forth in this privacy policy, or as otherwise required by applicable law.
