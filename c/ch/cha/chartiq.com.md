### We only collect anonymous information.

We utilize technologies such as cookies (small files stored by your browser), browser "local storage," web beacons, or unique device identifiers to anonymously identify your computer or device so we can deliver a better experience. Our systems also log information such as your browser, operating system and IP address.

We do not collect personally identifiable information (name, address, email, etc.) about you except if and when you supply it specifically to us to obtain one of our services (for instance providing us an email address in order to receive newsletters or supplying us with your credit card information in order to receive a subscription service).

We do not knowingly contact or collect personal information from children under 13. If you believe we have inadvertently collected such information, please contact us so we can promptly obtain parental consent or remove the information.

### We do not store or share your precise location.

We do not use or collect your precise geographic location.

### We do not share your data with other companies.

We generally do not share collected information with other companiesâ€”it is used for our own analysis to understand usage patterns, better optimize the user experience/user interface, and to plan for feature development or improvement. We will never sell your personal information to another company.

### You can ask privacy questions.

If you have any questions or concerns about our privacy policies, please [contact us](http://www.chartiq.com/contact/ "Contact Us").

### Analytics providers access data on our behalf.

Analytics companies may access anonymous data (such as your IP address or device ID) to help us understand how our services are used. They use this data solely on our behalf. They do not share it except in aggregate form; no data is shared as to any individual user.

We use Google Analytics to collect anonymous information about which features our users are utilizing in our software and how. Google Analytics collects information anonymously. It reports application trends without identifying individual visitors. Users may choose to prevent any of this anonymous data from being used by modifying your Google ad settings associated with your Google account, modifying your Google ad settings for mobile apps, using this [Google Analytics Opt-Out Browser Add-On](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/), or using any other means to opt-out of Google Ads.

We may collect demographic, interest, and location information in order to determine what kind of people visit our properties and use our products, how they found us, and why they might be interested in our products. We may participate in advertising and analytics services, such as those provided by Google and other search engines, including: Remarketing with Google Analytics, Google Display Network Impression Reporting, DoubleClick Platform integrations, and Google Analytics Demographic and Interest Reporting. The information collected through these programs is anonymous, aggregated, and not tied to personally identifiable information.

### We take steps to protect personal information

We take reasonable steps to secure your personally identifiable information against unauthorized access or disclosure. However, no security or encryption method can be guaranteed to protect information from hackers or human error.

Information we collect may be stored or processed on computers located in any country where we do business.

### Special situations may require disclosure of your data.

To operate the service, we also may make collected information available to third parties in these limited circumstances: (1) with your express consent, (2) when we have a good faith belief it is required by law, (3) when we have a good faith belief it is necessary to protect our rights or property, or (4) to any successor or purchaser in a merger, acquisition, liquidation, dissolution or sale of assets. Your consent will not be required for disclosure in these cases, but we will attempt to notify you, to the extent permitted by law to do so.

### You can review more privacy-related information.

This privacy policy was last updated on February 6, 2015. Our privacy policy may change from time to time. If we make any material changes to our policies, we will place a prominent notice on our website or application.
