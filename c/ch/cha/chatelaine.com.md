** Chatelaine.com Privacy Statement  
**

### Our promise...

Chatelaine.com will not sell, distribute, barter or transfer any personally identifiable information obtained about our users to a third party, without giving the user the opportunity to opt-out.

For more detailed information, please see our [Rogers Media Publishing privacy policy](http://www.rogersmagazines.com/privacy.htm).

DoubleClick Privacy Statement

Internet user privacy is of paramount importance to DoubleClick, our advertisers and our Web publishers. The success of our business depends upon our ability to maintain the trust of our users. Below is information regarding DoubleClick's commitment to protect the privacy of users and to ensure the integrity of the Internet. 

### User Information

All users who receive an ad targeted by DoubleClick's technology remain completely anonymous to DoubleClick. In the course of delivering an ad to you, DoubleClick does not collect any personally-identifiable information about you, such as your name, address, phone number or email address. DoubleClick does, however, collect certain non-personally-identifiable information about you, such as the server your computer is logged onto or your browser type (for example, Netscape or Internet Explorer). The information collected by DoubleClick is used for the purpose of targeting ads and measuring ad effectiveness on behalf of DoubleClick's advertisers and Web publishers who specifically request it. 

To enable DoubleClick to compile meaningful reports for its client Web sites and advertisers and to better target advertising to you, DoubleClick collects the following types of non-personally-identifiable information about users who are served ads via DoubleClick technology: 

Your IP address (a unique number assigned to every computer on the Internet). Information which DoubleClick can infer from the IP address includes the user's geographic location, company, and type and size of organization. Your domain type (i.e., .com, .net, or .edu.). 

Standard information included with every communication sent on the Internet. Information which DoubleClick can infer from this standard information includes your browser version and type (i.e., Netscape or Internet Explorer), operating system (i.e., windows or DOS), browser language (i.e., Java or Unix), service provider (i.e., MindSpring or AOL), your local time, etc. Clickstream information (i.e., DoubleClick can measure how you utilize the pages you visit within a site). 

On occasion, affiliated advertisers or Web publishers may provide DoubleClick with anonymous demographic information so that you may receive ads that more closely match your interests. This information is afforded the same stringent privacy protections as the DoubleClick-generated non-personally-identifiable data. 

DoubleClick believes that its limited use of the non-personally-identifiable data benefits you because it enhances the functionality and effectiveness of the advertisements you view which are delivered through the DoubleClick technology. 

There are some cases when a user voluntarily provides personal information in response to an ad (a survey or purchase form, for example). In these situations, DoubleClick (or a third party engaged by DoubleClick) collects the information on behalf of the advertiser and/or Web site. This information is used by the advertiser and/or Web site so that you can receive the goods, services or information that you requested. Where indicated in some requests, DoubleClick may use this information in aggregate form to get a more precise profile of the type of individuals viewing ads or visiting the Web sites. 

### Cookies and Opt Out

DoubleClick, along with thousands of other Web sites, uses cookies to enhance your Web viewing experience. DoubleClick's cookies cannot be used to determine any personally-identifiable information about you and do not damage your system or files in any way. 

Here's how it works. When you are first served an ad by DoubleClick, DoubleClick assigns you a unique number and records that number in the cookie file of your computer. Then, when you visit a Web site on which DoubleClick serves ads, DoubleClick reads this number to help target ads to you. The cookie can help ensure that you do not see the same ad over and over again. Cookies can also help advertisers measure how you utilize an advertiser's site. This information helps our advertisers cater their ads to your needs. 

While we believe that cookies enhance your Web experience by limiting the repetitiveness of advertising and increasing the level of relevant content on the Web, they are not essential for us to continue our leadership position in Web advertising. 

If you do not want the benefits of cookies, there is a simple procedure that allows you to deny or accept this feature. To find out more about this procedure, please click here. 

### Accepting/Declining Cookies

To eliminate cookies you may have currently accepted, and to deny cookies in the future, please follow this procedure: 

If you are using Netscape Navigator 3.0, go to the Options Menu, to Network Preferences and then to Protocols. Check the box that says "Show an alert before accepting a cookie." Then go into your Netscape folder (usually c:\program files\netspace\navigator) and delete the file which is called "cookies.txt." Under Windows 95, you could also use the Find feature on the start menu to simply find the file called Cookies.txt. 

In Internet Explorer 3.0, go to the View menu, then to Options, then to Advanced. Check the box that says "Warn before accepting cookies." Then go into your cookies directory (usually c:\windows\cookies) and delete all the files you have there. Once you delete these files, you will have no more cookies, and you will be prompted each time a Web site attempts to send a cookie to your system. At that time, you can choose to either Accept or Cancel the cookie. 

If you are using Netscape 4.0+, go to "Edit" in the menu bar, click on "Preferences", click on "Advanced", and check the box that says "Warn me before accepting a cookie". Now go to your "Start" button, click on "Find", click on "Files and Folders", type "cookies.txt" into the search box that appears, and click "Find Now". When the search results appear, drag all files listed, into the "Recycle Bin". Now shut down and restart your Netscape. 

### Disclosure

DoubleClick makes available all of our information practices at www.doubleclick.net, including in-depth descriptions of our targeting capabilities, this stance on privacy, and full disclosure on the use of cookies (above). In addition, we provide all users with the option to contact us at info@doubleclick.net with any further questions or concerns. 

### Honesty

DoubleClick has voluntarily opened its practices and systems for third party auditing. We are committed to shaping privacy policies and standards with industry organizations and are active members of the Internet Advertising Bureau, Online Privacy Alliance, New York New Media Association, and the American Advertising Federation. DoubleClick's policy on privacy is also in accordance with the Direct Marketing Association's Marketing Online Privacy Principles, which were agreed upon by the Interactive Services Association. |  |
