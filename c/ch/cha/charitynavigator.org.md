# Charity Navigator - Privacy

**Normal website usage:  
** Charity Navigator has a strong commitment to internet privacy. You can visit most portions of charitynavigator.org without telling us who you are and without revealing any personal information. The only information we collect from a normal web site visit is the name of your internet service provider, the browser and type of machine you are using, the web site that referred you to us, the pages you request and the date and time you request them. We use this information to generate statistics and measure site activity to improve the usefulness of the Charity Navigator site to our visitors.

 **Collection of personally identifiable information:**  
Charity Navigator may collect email addresses and other personally identifiable data about visitors when such data is voluntarily submitted to charitynavigator.org. For example, our site uses information collection forms for visitors to request information, sign up for the My Charities section, or to subscribe to our free newsletter. Contact information from these sign-up forms is used to send information and data about Charity Navigator to our visitors. We never request financial information from any of our visitors.

To become a member at the Charity Navigator site, we require registration of personal information. We use this information to make this function more effective and provide participants with additional information about charitable issues. All such information is collected and stored in a manner appropriate to the nature of the data.

Charity Navigator makes every effort to insure the secure collection and transmission of sensitive user information using industry accepted data collection and encryption methodologies.

 _Charity Navigator does not sell or otherwise disclose user information outside the organization.   This policy has no exceptions.  We do not sell or exchange your information with any other organization, public, private, or non-profit._ 

**Cookies:  
** Like most websites, Charity Navigator may place a "cookie," or small file, in the browser files of a visitor's computer. We use cookies to save information you give us so you don't have to re-enter it each time you visit our site. This allows us to personalize the site to your taste and provide the best web experience possible to our visitors. We do not use cookies to track your movement among different web sites and do not exchange cookies with other entities.

 **Amendment:  
** Charity Navigator may amend this policy from time to time.  If we make substantial changes in the way we use your name, address, or other information about you that you have disclosed to us, we will notify you by posting announcements on our web site.
