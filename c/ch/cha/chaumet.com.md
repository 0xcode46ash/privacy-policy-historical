Unless otherwise stated, all graphic and text features on the Website, such as brands and photographs, including the models shown, texts, videos, and animations, are protected throughout the world by copyright law, trademark law and the provisions of international treaties.

Personal data includes data such as your name and address, and electronic identification data available on or from your computer (such as “cookies”, “IP addresses” or your browser personal settings).
