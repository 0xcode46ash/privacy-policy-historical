# Privacy Policy - Charlotte Tilbury

**Your information**

The personal information about yourself which you give us – your name and email address – will be private to us and I promise we won’t give it away or sell it to anyone else. Obviously, on occasion, you may share certain details about yourself with other people, for example, when you post messages or other stuff to the site, when others can see things about you and who you are. If you do this, that is your choice and nothing to do with us or our own duty to protect the information you give us ourselves directly. Our duty is in relation to the information you give us in confidence and which we won’t share with others.

(Of course, if this informationis required as part of some legal process, or if we reasonably need to disclose it to somehow protect ourselves or the public, then that’s different.)

Obviously I don’t do everything on this website myself – sometimes my team and I rely on third party providers to do things for us. If this involves these third parties having access to any personal information, our arrangements with them will always mean this is done in total confidence and only for the purpose for which we enlist their help with the site, and that they will not be entitled to use that information themselves or to share it with anyone else.

In using the site, we may learn other things about our users, for example about the operating systems they use, their browser versions, domain names and IP addresses and the details of any website they are referred to us from.

You have the right to see the personal information we hold about you. You may do this at any time by requesting that information from us (by writing to us or by emailing or calling us). We may ask you questions to ensure we are dealing with the right person before responding to such a request and we also have the right to charge a processing fee in so doing. In addition, if you want to change or delete any of your personal information which you have given us previously, you can, whenever you like. Just get in touch via the [Contact](http://www.charlottetilbury.com/blog/contact/ "Contact") form or by post to 18 Lonsdale Road, London NW6 6RD.

On occasion, we may contact you to make sure our records are up to date and accurate or we may ask users update their own registered details by notice on the site itself. ****

**The Internet**

In giving us information, you are obviously submitting it to us via the internet. Whilst we will do everything (within reason) to protect the privacy of that information once it is received by us, the actual transmission of the information across the Internet is not our responsibility and no-one can guarantee to you that that part of the process is entirely secure, and so we can’t be responsible for that part of the process either. ****

**Things we may do with your information**

Once we have your information, unless you request otherwise we may email you with ideas we have or goods or services or events (ours or those of other organisations) we think you might be interested in, because of what we know about you. We may also on occasion ask you to participate in surveys we are running or things like that. If at any time you don’t wish to receive any more of these messages, you may opt-out of receiving them and we will tell you how to do this in any such message we do send you.

**Other websites**

When this site links to another website, we’re not responsible for that site’s contents or privacy policy and you should check these yourself where relevant.

**Changes to this policy**

We reserve the right to change this privacy policy at any time. If you’re worried about this, please keep checking back on this page. ****

This site uses cookies. Find out more about our [Cookies Policy](http://www.charlottetilbury.com/blog/cookies). ****
