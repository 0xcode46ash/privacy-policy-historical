This is the privacy policy that applies to our Sites and our services. MicroNet, Inc. has a strong commitment to safeguarding the privacy of our customers' personal information. Personal information is information about an identifiable individual. Publicly available information, such as a public directory listing of your name, address, telephone number, or electronic address, is not considered to be personal information.

### COLLECTION, USE AND DISCLOSURE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION

When you become a customer, we ask for information such as your name, organization name, and email address. We also collect the e-mail addresses and other personal information provided during account registration and data integration. Additionally we access other lists generated from advertising, email inquiries, trade shows and conferences. Information we collect is stored on computer servers that we use to operate the Site. These servers are located in the U.S. Personal information of contacts processed through and/or stored via our Site will also be held by us in accordance with this Privacy Policy. From time-to-time, we use these lists to promote our services. If you do not wish to receive such contact in the future, please click the “unsubscribe” link on any promotional email you receive from us.

The personal information we collect is used to provide our products and services, for billing, for identification and authentication, for the general operation and improvement of our service, and to respond to inquiries, and is not used, shared with or sold to other organizations, except: to our service providers, as required to operate the Site and provide the products or services you've requested; to the applicable customer of the account in respect of which contact information is submitted to us; for collection purposes; to law enforcement agencies, in emergencies, for internal security matters, or where required by court order or search warrant; or when we have your permission. We do not contact our customers' contacts except as related to operating the Site (for example: event notifications and reminders, membership renewals, security and other notifications).

We may also disclose personal information in connection with the transfer to the acquirer upon the change of control.

We may also record your computer's IP address with your order to help us identify fraudulent credit card use. We may share this information with the financial institution that issued the credit card with which an order was placed or with law enforcement authorities if we determine, or are notified, that the use of the credit card was fraudulent.

Your personal information is not used or disclosed by us for any other purpose.
