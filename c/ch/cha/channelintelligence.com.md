# Privacy Policy - CIBoost

**Marketing Products & Services**

_Last modified and effective as of May 18, 2011._

Channel Intelligence, Inc. (“CI” or “We”) provides services and technology to companies (“CI Clients”) that make it easier for online shoppers to find and buy products. CI performs most of its services behind the scenes on the websites of CI Clients and on other websites that direct web traffic to or receive web traffic from CI Clients. In the course of performing its services, CI may collect user information, on an anonymous basis, when a user views or interacts with a CI Client webpage or the product offerings or advertisements of a CI Client presented through a third party’s webpage (collectively, “CI Collection Points”). This Privacy Policy will apply to the collection and treatment of user information in connection with CI’s Marketing Products & Services .

### COLLECTION OF INFORMATION

**What types of user information does CI collect?**

CI receives and stores certain types of information whenever you interact with us through a CI Collection Point. The information collected by CI though a CI Collection Point in the course of providing services to CI Clients is Non-Personally Identifiable Information (“Non-PII”). Non-PII is information that cannot by itself be used to identify a particular person or entity, and may include a user’s IP host address, pages viewed, browser type, Internet browsing and usage habits, Internet Service Provider, domain name, the time/date of site visit, the referring URL and computer operating system. In other words, the user remains anonymous throughout CI’s collection, use and storage of the user’s information.

**What types of user information is not collected by CI?**

CI does not collect Personally Identifiable Information (“PII”) through any CI Collection Point or other means. PII is any information that can be used to identify or locate a particular person or entity, such as name, address, telephone number, mobile number, or email address. CI Collection Points may operate in the context of websites, and CI’s services may direct users to third party websites, that do collect PII, though CI does not collect PII.

**Why does CI collect user information?**

CI wants to make it easy for consumers to shop online for the products they are looking for. This requires the collection of information to help us identify and present purchasing opportunities for products that might be of interest to you.

**How does CI collect user information?**

CI collects anonymous information from visitors to the websites on which it operates CI Collection Points in the following ways:

  * **Information You Provide Directly**  We collect the information, if any, you knowingly and voluntarily provide (excluding PII) when you use a website on which a CI Collection Point is in operation.
  * **Information You Provide Through Your Browser**  We collect information that is made visible to one of the CI Collection Points automatically by your web browser. The information provided by your web browser does not identify you personally. This information typically includes your IP address, the address of the web page you were visiting when you interacted with a CI Collection Point, the name of your computer operating system, the name and version of your Internet browser, and the date and time of your visit. The information may also include information concerning your interaction with the website. The information we receive depends on the settings on your web browser. Please check your browser if you want to learn what information your browser sends or how to change your settings.
  * **Information Collected Through Cookies**  We use “cookies,” and similar technologies, such as web beacons (also referred to as “tracking pixels,” or “action tags”), to collect user information and support the functionality of our services and the CI Collection Points. For more information about our use of cookies and web beacons, see below.



**What are “cookies” and “web beacons” and how does CI use them to collect user information?**

CI collects anonymous information through “cookies.” A cookie is a small piece of data containing a unique identification number that is sent to your browser from a web server and is stored on your computer’s hard drive. The unique ID number identifies your browser to CI’s computers whenever you interact with a CI Collection Point. Cookies do not enable anyone to access personally identifiable information that you have not already given them. CI primarily uses cookies to identify selling opportunities. A selling opportunity represents a unique user, product or service, and date combination. The selling opportunity information helps CI Clients better present selling opportunities to prospective customers.

If you choose to not accept cookies, you will not be able to make use of the services we provide.

In operating the CI Collection Points, we sometimes employ a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. web beacons). Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies. These clear gifs are invisible on the page and about the size of the period at the end of this sentence.

### USE OF INFORMATION

**How does CI use user information?**

We use the anonymous information collected through the CI Collection Points to improve the experience of visitors to CI Clients’ websites, to identify and present purchase opportunities, offers and coupons tailored to individual users and for security and fraud prevention purposes. In addition, we may review server logs from time to time for security purposes, such as detecting intrusions into our network. If we suspect criminal activity, we might share our server logs — which contain visitors’ IP addresses — with the appropriate investigative authorities who might be able to use that information to trace and identify individuals.

**Who has access to the user information that CI collects?**

When you submit information to CI, it is generally collected, processed and maintained solely by CI. Sometimes, CI will provide anonymous information about a website visitor to the owner of the website or to the CI Client for whom CI deployed a CI Collection Point on such website with the permission of the owner of the website. CI shares user information only as described below. CI does not resell the collected information.

  * **CI Clients and Website Owners**  We perform services for the benefit of CI Clients and share user information collected in the course of performing such services with CI Clients and with the owners of the websites visited by the user, if a CI Collection Point is in operation.
  * **Third-Party Service Providers**  We and CI Clients employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our and their behalf. Examples include analyzing data and providing marketing assistance. Such third party service providers have limited access to user information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes.
  * **Business Transfers**  As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy certain products or business units. In such transactions, user information generally is one of the transferred business assets but remains subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Policy.
  * **Protection of CI and Others**  We release user information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law; enforce or apply our Terms of Service and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of CI, CI Clients, our users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction. However, this does not include selling, renting, sharing, or otherwise disclosing personally identifiable information from users for commercial purposes in violation of the commitments set forth in this Privacy Policy.
  * **With Your Consent**  Other than as set out in this Privacy Policy, you will receive notice when information about you might go to third parties, and you will have an opportunity to choose not to share the information



**Is the user information collected by CI maintained securely?**

CI stores the information it collects from users securely. To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the appropriate use of information, CI uses physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information it collects. However, you should consider any communication that you transmit over the Internet as non-confidential, and you agree that CI will not be liable or responsible if information that belongs to you is intercepted and used by an unintended recipient.

**How long does CI keep user information?**

CI keeps behavioral advertising information for 2 years and to preserve the  
integrity of its databases, CI retains the anonymized information it  
collects for 10 years.

**How is user information protected at third party websites and services to which users are directed by CI services?**

CI services operate from within and links to third party websites and services, including those operated by CI Clients. We do not have access to or control over cookies or other features that they may use, and the information practices of those services and third-party websites are not covered by this Privacy Policy. Please contact them directly for more information about their privacy practices.

### POLICY CHOICES AND CHANGES

**How can I opt out of the use of my information for behavioral advertising?**

The Networking Advertising Initiative (NAI) offers useful information about Internet advertising companies, including information about how to opt out of their information collection. You may opt out of receiving behavioral targeted advertisements controlled by CI by clicking [here](http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp). Opting out does not prohibit CI or its advertisers from serving advertisement to you, but it does eliminate our ability to display relevant ads, offers and coupons based on your personal interests. If you delete or restrict cookies, you will need to re-register your opt out preferences.

**Will this policy change?**

Our business changes constantly, and our Privacy Policy will change also. You should check our Website frequently to see recent changes. Unless stated otherwise, our current Privacy Policy applies to all information that we have about you. We will never materially change our policies and practices to make them less protective of user information collected in the past without the consent of affected users.

**What should I do if I have concerns about CI’s privacy practices?**
