# Chalk.com - About us

  
**Chalk Privacy Policy**

Thank you for visiting the Chalk.com Network website. Your privacy is important to us and we are committed to respecting and protecting your privacy. We provide this notice to explain our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is used at Chalk.com Network.

**Principles:**

  * Chalk.com Network collects personally identifiable information about certain customers exclusively to provide specific information and services requested by you such as newsletters, online contests or surveys.
  * Chalk.com Network uses your personalized information to provide the most unique and valuable visitor experience possible.
  * Chalk.com Network will not release your personal data to anyone without your explicit consent.
  * Chalk.com Network does not monitor individual traffic patterns on our site, instead only aggregate user behavior is collected for various areas of the site.
  * You may change the status of whether you wish to receive communications from us at any time.
  * Aggregate information is provided to our advertisers and partners, but individual user information is not shared. 

**Collecting Information:**

The Chalk.com Network collects only personally identifying information about users when it is specifically and knowingly provided by the user. In the case of optional email registration and contests, users are required to supply a username and e-mail address. Also, in some circumstances the user must answer additional questions relating to such topics as age, gender, zip code and employment status in order to participate. Consequently, the Chalk.com Network may collect information from children under the age of 13 but does not retain this information. The Chalk.com Network ensures that this information is effectively removed. This information is only used in aggregate and the security and integrity of this information is maintained.

The Chalk.com Network gathers e-mail addresses of users who voluntarily subscribe to its newsletters. Users may remove themselves from this mailing list by simply sending an email to the unsubscribe@chalk.com address that is provided in every newsletter or by unsubscribing in the Newsletter Subscription area of our website. 

  * **Send to a Friend**  
Chalk.com Network offers users the ability to mail certain video and text materials to someone else. The user must provide their e-mail address and that of the recipient. The information is used only in the case of transmission errors, and, of course, to let the recipient know who sent the story. These e-mail addresses are not used for any other purposes.
  *  **Chalk PC Support Center**  
Chalk.com Network collects additional information about users' computer systems and usage habits necessary to fully utilize the Chalk PC Support Center. This information is shared with our partner, PC Support in order to provide these services. Chalk.com Network will not sell or transfer any user specific information to any third party other than PC Support. We may use this information in aggregate to determine general information about our users in order to offer more specifically valuable services or provide aggregate information to our advertising partners. For more information on how PC Support may use this information, please refer to their privacy policy directly at [www.pcsupport.com](http://www.pcsupport.com/). 
  * **Cookies**  
A cookie is a small data file that certain Web sites write to your hard drive when you visit them. A cookie can contain information such as a user ID that the site uses to track the pages you have visited and to allow easy and repeated access to restricted areas of the website. The only information a cookie can contain is the information you supply yourself. A cookie cannot read off your hard drive or read cookie files created by other sites. Chalk.com Network uses cookies to simplify access to restricted areas, to track aggregate user traffic, and to remember user preferences set during prior visits to Chalk.com.

If you've set your browser to warn you before accepting cookies, you will receive the warning message with each cookie.

You can refuse cookies by turning them off in your browser. You do not need to have cookies turned on to use the Chalk.com Network website.


**Use of Information**

Chalk.com Network uses information voluntarily provided by our users to enhance their experience, whether to personalize elements on the site or better prepare future content based on the interest of our users. 

Chalk.com Network uses information users voluntarily provide in order to send out newsletters on a regular basis as well as periodic special information summaries we believe might be of particular interest to our visitors.

Chalk.com Network uses tracking information to determine which areas of our site are most popular based on traffic flow. We do not use individual tracking information to track specific user behavior or use of our site features. Usage information is only collected in the aggregate to help identify the interest of our visitors and improve our overall offering.

Chalk.com Network uses cookies to allow our advertisers to present advertisements we believe will be of particular interest to you. Cookies may contain information about areas of our site you have visited frequently and other usage trends, but will never correlate that information with any personally identifiable information you may provide us. Further, aggregate information about our users may be sold, rented, or shared; however individual information will never be passed to any third party without your prior explicit consent.

Chalk.com Network creates aggregate reports on user demographics, IP addresses, and traffic patterns for advertisers and partners. This allows advertisers to advertise more effectively, and allows our users to receive advertisements that are pertinent to their needs. Because Chalk.com Network does not track usage of specific users, an advertiser will not know that a specific user clicked their ad.

Chalk.com Network may allow select advertisers to e-mail promotions to registrants and newsletter recipients who have given their consent for such communication. All communications are pre-approved by Chalk.com Network and conducted by a reputable third party to ensure proper use of the e-mail lists. Users are asked at the time their information is collected if they would prefer to not receive this type of communication. Users may change this designation at any time.

**Maintenance Policy**

Chalk.com Network gives users several options regarding their personal information including: 

  * Choosing to receive electronic newsletters and special electronic correspondence from Chalk.com Network.
  * Choosing not to receive information from third party advertisers and partners
  * Choosing not to provide personal information other than e-mail addresses when subscribing to our newsletter service or participating in contests.

Chalk.com Network offers users the ability to correct or change the information collected during registration for free e-mail. Users may change this information at any time and as often as necessary by logging on to our website at [http://www.chalktv.com](http://www.chalktv.com/) and changing their user preferences under the options directory.

Users may unsubscribe from our electronic newsletter and periodic communications at anytime by following the instructions contained in each item of correspondence.

Currently, Chalk.com Network does not allow users the ability to completely delete personal information provided at the time of registration.

We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our Web site. Our third-party advertising company also separately places or recognizes a cookie file on your browser in the course of delivering advertisements to this Site. These companies may use information (not including your name, address email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, please click [here](http://www.sonar.com/content/privacy.htm).
