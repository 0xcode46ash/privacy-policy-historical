# Privacy Statement | ChargeSmart(tm)

When you visit the ChargeSmart™ website, we collect your IP address and standard web log information, such as your browser type and the pages you accessed on our website. 

If you open an account, we collect the following types of information from you: 

  * Contact information - your name, address, phone, email, and other similar information.
  * Credit Card information - the credit card numbers that you link to your ChargeSmart™ account.



Before permitting you to use our Service, we may require you to provide additional information we can use to verify your identity or address or manage risk, such as your date of birth, social security number or other information. We may also obtain information about you from third parties such as credit bureaus and identity verification services. 

Finally, we may collect additional information from or about you in other ways not specifically described here. For example, we may collect information related to your contact with our customer support team or store results when you respond to a survey. 

## Cookies

When you access our website, we, or companies we hire to track how our website is used, may place small data files called "cookies" on your computer. 

We send a "session cookie" to your computer when you log in to your account. This type of cookie helps us to recognize you if you visit multiple pages on our site during the same session, so that we don't need to ask you for your password on each page. Once you log out or close your browser, this cookie expires and no longer has any effect. 

## Personal Information

Throughout this policy, we use the term "personal information" to describe information that can be associated with a specific person and can be used to identify that person. We do not consider personal information to include information that has been anonymized so that it does not identify a specific user. 

We store and process your personal information on our computers in the US, and we protect it by maintaining physical, electronic and procedural safeguards that both meet and exceed applicable US federal and state regulations. We use computer safeguards such as firewalls and data encryption, we enforce physical access controls to our buildings and files, and we authorize access to personal information only for those employees who require it to fulfill their job responsibilities. 

Our primary purpose in collecting personal information is to provide you with a safe, smooth, efficient, and customized experience. We may use your personal information to: 

  * Provide the services and customer support you request;
  * Process transactions and send notices about your transactions
  * Resolve disputes, collect fees, and troubleshoot problems;
  * Prevent potentially prohibited or illegal activities;
  * Customize, measure, and improve our services and the content and layout of our website;
  * Compare information for accuracy and verify it with third parties.



To process your payments, we need to share some of your personal information with the person or company that you are paying. 

We work with merchants to enable them to accept payments from you using ChargeSmart™. In doing so, a merchant may share information about you with us, such as your email address, when you attempt to pay that merchant. We use this information to confirm to that merchant that you are a ChargeSmart™ customer and that the merchant should enable ChargeSmart™ as a form of payment for your purchase. 

Regardless, we will not disclose your credit card number or bank account number to anyone you have paid through ChargeSmart™, except with your express permission or if we are required to do so to comply with a subpoena or other legal process. 

## Sharing Personal Information

We may share your personal information with: 

  * Service providers under contract who help with parts of our business operations; (fraud prevention, bill collection, marketing, technology services). Our contracts dictate that these service providers only use your information in connection with the services they perform for us and not for their own benefit.
  * Financial institutions that we partner with to jointly create and offer products or services.
  * Credit bureaus to report outstanding negative balance accounts, as allowed by law.
  * Companies that we plan to merge with or be acquired by. (Should such a combination occur, we will require that the new combined entity follow this privacy policy with respect to your personal information. If your personal information could be used contrary to this policy, you will receive prior notice.)
  * Law enforcement, government officials, or other third parties when: 
    * we are compelled to do so by a subpoena, court order or similar legal procedure
    * we need to do so to comply with law
    * we believe in good faith that the disclosure of personal information is necessary to prevent physical harm or financial loss, to report suspected illegal activity, or to investigate violations of our User Agreement.
  * Other third parties with your consent or direction to do so.
