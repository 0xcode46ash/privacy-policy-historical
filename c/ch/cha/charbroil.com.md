 **Sharing Your Information**

Your personally identifiable information will not be rented or sold to any third party. Char-Broil may share your personal information as follows:



  1.  **Companies who work on our behalf:** We contract with other companies to perform business support functions on our behalf, which may involve limited access to your personal information. We require these companies to use the information only to provide the contracted services; they are prohibited from transferring the information to another party except as needed to provide those services. Some examples of these business support functions include coupon fulfillment, customer survey execution, and customer support.
  2.  **Parent corporation and sister companies:** WC Bradley Co. is the "parent corporation" to Char-Broil, LLC.  W.C. Bradley Co. has several other affiliated companies or business units. We may share your information with a WC Bradley affiliated company or business unit, with the requirement that they not transfer your information to another party for marketing purposes, or use your information contrary to your expressed choices.
  3.  **Business Transfers:** Char-Broil reserves the right to disclose or transfer your personal information in connection with the sale or transfer of all or a portion of our business or assets. If the business is sold or transferred, Char-Broil will give you an opportunity to tell us not to transfer your personal information. In some cases, this may mean that the new organization will not be able to continue providing to you the services or products that Char-Broil provided.
  4.  **Law Enforcement:** Char-Broil may disclose personal information to third parties without your consent for any of the following reasons: to comply with any law, regulation or court order, to cooperate with Government investigations, to help prevent fraud or when reasonably necessary to enforce or protect the rights of Char-Broil, third parties or the public at large.  If you are located outside of the United States, please note that personal information you provide may be transferred to and stored in servers located in the United States and may be accessible to U.S. law enforcement and security authorities.
  5.  **With Your Consent:** In all other cases, Char-Broil will obtain your express consent before sharing your information with third parties. For example, Char-Broil may conduct a joint offer or contest with a third party and you will be asked whether your personal information should be shared with that third party.




 **Your Choices about Receiving E-mail**



  1. We will give you an opportunity to let us know your preference regarding the receiving of promotional e-mail when you provide us with your personal information or when we send you e-mail. Promotional e-mail that you receive from Char-Broil or its affiliates will tell you how to decline receiving future promotional e-mails.
  2. Char-Broil or its affiliates may also send you e-mail with information and/or special offers about products and services that may be of interest to you, unless you indicate you do not want to receive them.
  3. Finally, Char-Broil may send you e-mail about your orders or your account. These are transactional in nature—rather than promotional—and do not contain unsubscribe capability as we need to communicate to fulfill our business obligation with you.




 **Protecting Your Information**

Char-Broil implements a variety of administrative, managerial, and technical security measures to help protect your personal information.  While we strive to protect your personal information, you should safeguard and take steps to protect yourself on the Internet.
