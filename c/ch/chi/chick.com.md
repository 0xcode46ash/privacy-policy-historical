When you place an order with chick.com, it is necessary for us to collect personal information from you, such as your name, address, etc. We do not share this information with anyone other than those people who must process your order. We use that information to fill your request, and we will mail free samples and announcements of new products to you. 

We do not provide our mailing list to any other party, by any means. We respect your privacy. We do not participate in information-sharing marketing schemes, nor do we send unsolicited "spam" email. Our periodic email announcements go only to those people who have requested them.
