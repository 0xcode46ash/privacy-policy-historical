**1\. Information We Collect On The Website:** "Personal Identifiable Information" or "Personal Information" is information that can be used to identify you as an individual or allow someone to contact you. When other information, such as a favorite team or player, is associated with personal information, it also becomes Personal Information for purposes of this Policy. We collect Personal Information such as your full name, telephone number, street address, email address, unique identifiers (like your Message Board User ID and password), demographic information (like your date of birth, age, gender, ticket holder status, game attendance, marital status, or number of children), and financial information (like your credit or debit card number) in various ways and for various reasons.

Web site operators cannot condition participation in an activity on the user providing more personal information than is reasonably necessary for the activity. Users can review their personal information, have it deleted and refuse to permit any further collection by visiting the My Chicago Bears Preference Center or by contacting the Chicago Bears at [fanservices@chicagobears.com](mailto:fanservices@chicagobears.com) .

**Email Communications:** When you open emails from us, we may receive a confirmation noting you opened the email, if your computer supports such capabilities. We also may keep track of what emails we send you and what emails you may be receiving from our subsidiaries and affiliates. Additionally, we keep a record of what communications you have opted to receive or not to receive.

We may collect information from you in several different areas on the Website, including but not limited to those described below:

**Registration:**

We may collect information from you in several different areas on the Website, including but not limited to those described below:

**Registration:** You may be asked to complete a registration form and provide personally identifiable information; you may also be asked to choose a user ID and password in order to take advantage of certain features the Website may choose to offer, such as newsletters or contests. Participation in registration is voluntary and you will have the opportunity to decide whether or not to disclose information to the Website.

**Newsletters and Website Emails:** We offer free newsletters to share information with you about the Website, about us and our affiliates and subsidiaries, or about our marketing partners and advertisers and sponsors. You may receive a newsletter either by registering for a particular newsletter or in conjunction with a special feature or membership for which you have registered on the Website. Participation is voluntary and you will have the opportunity to decide whether or not to disclose information to the Website. You may also cancel your free email subscription by emailing [fanservices@chicagobears.com](mailto:fanservices@chicagobears.com) or by following the instructions provided on the Website or in the newsletter or email.

**Send To A Friend:** If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about our site, we will ask you for your friends email address. We will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the site. The Chicago Bears do not store this information after sending this one-time email.

**Contests or Sweepstakes:** We periodically operate contests and sweepstakes through the Website that may require registration or the submission of personal information. Participation is voluntary and you will have the opportunity to decide whether or not to disclose information to the Website. Your personally identifiable information may be used to contact you for winner notification, prize delivery confirmation or other related purposes, (see the rules of each contest for details about how your personal information will be used).

We may also ask your permission to allow us to publicly post some of your information on the Website, such as on a winner's page, in the event you win a contest or sweepstakes. Except as required by applicable law, we will not post your information without your permission. In some instances, a third party advertiser or sponsor may operate or host a contest or sweepstakes on the Website, and collect your information. In those cases, where we are not the operator or host of the contest or sweepstakes, we do not collect your information and we have no control over the information collected from you. Accordingly, we urge you to review the advertiser's or sponsor's privacy policy applicable to the contest or sweepstakes before participating.

**Surveys or Voting:** From time-to-time we may request personally identifiable information from you in conjunction with a survey or voting poll. Participation is voluntary and you will have the opportunity to decide whether or not to disclose information to the Website.

**Games:** When you register to play games or trivia on our Website, you may be asked to provide personally identifiable information.

**Cookies:** As with many Websites, our Website uses a technology called "cookies." A cookie is a unique, random number that is stored in the browser on your computer. The cookie doesn't actually identify you, just the computer that is used to visit the site.

Cookies automatically identify your browser to the Website whenever your computer is used to visit the Website. Cookies also let us know how many people visit our website and where visitors go on the site. In addition, cookies can let us know non-personally identifiable information, like what web browser is being used to access the website. For registered users, cookies can make using the Website easier for you by saving information such as your passwords or preferences. By tracking how and when you use the Website, cookies help us determine which areas are popular and which are not. Many improvements and updates to the Website are based on data obtained from cookies. Accepting cookies allows you, among other things, to personalize your experience on the Website. Cookies may also allow the Website to present to you advertising which may be of interest to you. If you do not want information collected through the use of cookies, your browser should contain an option that allows you to disable or delete cookie data at any time. Some areas of the Website, however, may not provide you with a personalized experience if you have disabled the use of cookies. Cookies, log files and web-beacons are not tied to a user's personally identifiable information.

Some of our business partners, sponsors or advertisers, use cookies on our site. We have no access to or control over these cookies.

This privacy statement covers the use of cookies by [www.ChicagoBears.com](https://web.archive.org/) only and does not cover the use of cookies by any third parties.

**Web Beacons and Other Tracking Technology:** Our Website uses a variety of technical methods for tracking purposes, including Web beacons. Web beacons are small pieces of data that are embedded in images on the pages of Web sites. We also use these technical methods to analyze the traffic patterns on our Web sites, such as the frequency with which our users visit various parts of our Web sites. These technical methods may involve the transmission of information either directly to us or to another party authorized by us to collect information on our behalf. We also use these technical methods in HTML e-mails that we send our guests to determine whether our guests have opened those e-mails and/or clicked on links in those e-mails. The information from use of these technical methods may be collected in a form that is personally identifiable.

**IP Addresses and Click-Stream Data:** We may collect IP addresses and/or click-stream data. An IP address is a number associated with the service through which you access the internet, like your ISP (Internet Service Provider), your company, or your university. Standing alone, your IP address is not personally identifiable. At times, we also use IP addresses for purposes of system administration and to report aggregate information to our advertisers and sponsors, for example regarding the frequency with which our guests visit various parts of our sites. We may combine this information with personally identifiable information. Click-stream data is information as the page served, the time, the source of the request, and other such non-personal information. When analyzed, this data helps us analyze how visitors arrive at the Website, what type of content is most popular, what type of visitors in the aggregate are interested in particular kinds of content and advertising, and the like.

**Transaction Information:** If you conduct a financial transaction with our Website, such as order information from our Website, buy our merchandise, or subscribe to services offered on our Website, we will ask you to complete an order form that will request certain information from you, including contact information, demographic information and financial information. We will use this information to complete the transaction that you have requested, i.e., to deliver the information, products or other services that you order, and to invoice you. For your protection, such information is collected and stored through encrypted means.

These other Websites may send their own cookies to you, independently collect data or solicit personal information and may or may not have their own published privacy policies.
