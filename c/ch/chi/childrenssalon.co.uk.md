# Privacy policy | Childrensalon

**Personal information**

We value our customers, and our priority is to ensure your personal information is secure and your privacy is respected. We collect customer information when you place an order online, in an effort to improve your shopping experience and to communicate with you about our products and promotions. In addition, you may elect to sign up to receive email updates about our products and promotions.

We collect personal information only when you voluntarily submit the information and we most definitely do not sell or rent the information you provide to us to third parties. When you make an online purchase from us, we use your information to process your order. We will also send you emails to confirm your order, and we may need to contact you by telephone, email or regular post if we have other questions regarding your order.

If at any time you would like us to remove you from our email mailing list or registration database, please contact us via email, including your full name and the email address used when accessing or ordering from our site.

We use the SagePay Payment Service Provider system. All transaction information passed between merchant sites and the SagePay systems are encrypted using 128-bit SSL certificates. Sounds complicated, we know.

Your details are not disclosed to any third parties without your consent. For more information please visit [www.sagepay.com](http://www.sagepay.com/).
