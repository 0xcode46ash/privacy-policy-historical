## [Privacy Policy](http://www.chicagoibusiness.com/privacy-policy "Privacy Policy")

Your privacy is critically important to us. At www.chicagoibusiness.com we have a few fundamental principles:

•We don’t ask you for personal information unless we truly need it. (We can’t stand services that ask you for things like your gender or income level for no apparent reason.)  
•We don’t share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop our products, or protect our rights.  
•We don’t store personal information on our servers unless required for the on-going operation of one of our services.  
•In our blogging products, we aim to make it as simple as possible for you to control what’s visible to the public, seen by search engines, kept private, and permanently deleted.  
Below is our privacy policy which incorporates these goals: (Note, we’ve decided to make this privacy policy available under a Creative Commons Sharealike license, which means you’re more than welcome to steal it and repurpose it for your own use, just make sure to replace references to us with ones to you, and if you want we’d appreciate a link to www.chicagoibusiness.com somewhere on your site. We spent a lot of money and time on the below, and other people shouldn’t need to do the same.)
