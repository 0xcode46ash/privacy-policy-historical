While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also protect user-information off-line.  All of our users' information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices.  Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information.  Finally, the servers that store personally identifiable information are in a secure environment, in a locked facility.
