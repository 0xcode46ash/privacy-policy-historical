## Privacy Policy

#### The Effective Date of this Agreement is on September 10, 2007.

ChineseYe is an online application that helps people who are interested in China and Chinese find useful information they can trust by soliciting and aggregating experience. To accomplish this, our users share their experiences about Chinese things that are posted to the ChineseYe Site. These experiences can then be accessed and read by other ChineseYe users. For the purposes of this Privacy Policy, a "user" is defined as someone using the ChineseYe Site, and a "friend" is defined as someone you have explicitly invited to share reviews with you. To fulfill the purpose of our site, we need to display a limited amount of personal information, so that users are able to evaluate the trustworthiness of a particular review. By using ChineseYe, you permit the collection and use of your personal information as outlined below in our Privacy Policy. You should visit this page periodically to review any changes to the Privacy Policy. 

#### (1) Information We Collect

ChineseYe collects user submitted account information such as name and email address to identify you and send you notifications related to the use of the service. ChineseYe also collects user submitted location information such as city, state or zip. ChineseYe also collects user submitted photos, experiences, and ratings of local service and service providers. 

Some information collected is not explicitly submitted by the user; we log your browser-type related information, IP address, requested URL, referring URL, and timestamp 

#### (2) How We Use Your Information

Information such as your full name, profile photo and any personally identifiable information you have included in your experiences may be shown to friends or other users primarily in conjunction with reviews you have contributed. If a person is a friend they can also see your name or email address in their list of friends. In addition, we may sell your experiences to third parties, in which case your first name and last initial and any personally identifiable information you have included in your reviews may be shown to users of such third party web sites. 

Your full name and email address may also be used when you send an email notification to a friend (such as in an invitation, or when sharing a experience).

Additionally, we use your email address to contact you on behalf of your friends (such as when someone sends you a personal message). 

Browser-type related information, IP address, requested URL, referring URL, and timestamp data help us diagnose problems with our server, administer ChineseYe, and otherwise provide the highest possible level of service to you. In addition, we use this information to perform statistical analyses of user behavior and characteristics in order to measure interest in and use of the various areas of the site and to inform advertisers of such information as well as the number of users that have been exposed to, or clicked on, their advertising banners. 

#### (3) Transfer of Information

We may share your experiences with third parties. Your first name and last initial, profile photo, any submitted photos of businesses, and any personally identifiable information you have included in your experiences may be transferred to such third parties and displayed on their websites in connection with such third parties' publication of your experiences.

In such an event, ChineseYe will notify you before information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
