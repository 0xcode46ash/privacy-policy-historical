### WE USE VARIOUS TECHNOLOGIES TO COLLECT INFORMATION: 

### COOKIES

A cookie is a small data file stored in your browser when you visit a website or access an application. Chicago Booth sends cookies when you visit any of our sites or sites where our ads appear. Accepting the cookies used on our site, or sites on which our ads appear, may give us access to information about your browsing behavior, which we may use to personalize your experience. Cookies are typically classified as either “session” cookies or “persistent” cookies.

  * Session cookies do not stay on your computer after you close your browser.
  * Persistent cookies remain on your computer until you delete them or they expire. 



Most browsers automatically accept cookies by default, but you can usually refuse cookies or selectively accept cookies by adjusting the preferences in your browser (please refer to your browser’s help function to learn more about cookie controls). If you turn off cookies, there may be some features of our site that will not be available to you, and some web pages may not display properly.

### WEB BEACONS

Web beacons (also known as pixel tags, internet tags, clear GIFs, or single-pixel GIFs) and embedded scripts are other technologies that we use on our websites and in our applications, as well as in some of our emails and ads. 

Web beacons (or “tags”) are bits of programming code included in web pages, emails, and ads that notify us (or the companies that help us run our business) when those web pages, emails, or ads have been viewed or clicked on. Embedded scripts are bits of programming code included within some of our web pages that measure how you use those web pages, such as which links you click on. We use this information to improve our websites and online services, tailor our websites and online services to your likely interests, and conduct market research. You may be able to turn off scripting functionality, such as JavaScript, within your browser (please refer to your browser’s help function). Note that if you disable scripting functionality, some of our websites and applications may not function properly.

### ADVERTISING AND RETARGETING ON THIRD-PARTY WEBSITES

Chicago Booth and the University contract with service providers to place ads on websites owned by third parties. These service providers may send third-party cookies from—and use web beacons on—their websites, as well as on chicagobooth.edu. These cookies and web beacons may enable Chicago Booth to collect information about the pages you viewed and the links you clicked on. At times, these third-party websites may advertise to previous visitors that visited a Chicago Booth site but did not complete a task on our site, for example, finishing a contact form to make an enquiry. 

Most web browsers include a “Do Not Track” feature that offers you the ability to inform websites and ad networks that you do not want your online activities tracked.
