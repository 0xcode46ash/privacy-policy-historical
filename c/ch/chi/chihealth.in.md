**ChiHealth Privacy Policy**

ChiHealth understands how important the privacy of personal information is to our users. This Privacy Policy will tell you what information we collect about you and about your use of ChiHealth and its services. It will explain the choices you have about how your personal information is used and how we protect that information. We urge you to read this Privacy Policy carefully.

This Privacy Policy applies to Web sites owned and operated by ChiHealth that are intended for use by consumers (non-professionals) for non-commercial personal, family or household purposes, including ChiHealth.in, StepUpToLife.com, and others including the mobile optimized versions of these sites (we refer to these sites collectively as the "ChiHealth Web Sites"). However, if you are an employee or health plan member who has enabled access to your health record at ChiHealth.in by registering at your employer’s or health plan’s website, the privacy policy applicable to your information at your employer’s or health plan’s website remains applicable to your personal health record at ChiHealth.in. If your employer or health plan account is no longer made available to you by your employer or health plan, you will continue to have access to your health information from ChiHealth.in, using the same username and password, but will be subject to this Privacy Policy. Except where noted, statements in this Privacy Policy with respect to the ChiHealth Web Sites also apply to the ChiHealth Mobile Device Application (or "App") for the iOS, Android, Windows and Blackberry operating systems.

References to "ChiHealth" mean ChiHealth and Workplace Wellness Solutions Pvt. Ltd., including any company that it controls.

**Information Collected About You**

Some of our interactive tools and services may request you to submit health information, which would also be considered Personal Information. You are responsible for ensuring the accuracy of the Personal Information that you submit to ChiHealth. Inaccurate information will affect your experience when using the ChiHealth Web Sites and tools and our ability to contact you as described in this Privacy Policy.

**Registration**

Access to some ChiHealth interactive tools and services may be limited to users who have registered. Some of our tools (such as certain quizzes or calculators) do not retain your Personal Information, while others store your Personal Information in accordance with this Privacy Policy and the authorization you provide at the time you submit Personal Information in order to use the tool. ChiHealth Personal Health Records, which allows you a secure place to gather, store, manage and share your Personal Information and provides tools and services to better manage your health and the health of your family, requires additional registration.

When our market research surveys collect Personal Information we will not knowingly accept participants who are under the age of 13.

**Community, Health Communities, Blogs and Other Public Forums**

ChiHealth features several community areas and other public forums where users with similar interests or medical conditions can share information and support one another or where users can post questions for experts to answer. We also offer online discussions moderated by healthcare experts. Our communities are open to the public and should not be considered private.

**Any information (including Personal Information) you share in any online community area including a chat room, Health Community, Ask Our Expert posting or online discussion is by design open to the public and is not private. You should think carefully before posting any Personal Information in any public forum. What you post can be seen, disclosed to or collected by third parties and may be used by others in ways we cannot control or predict, including to contact you for unauthorized purposes. As with any public forum on any site, the information you post may also show up in third-party search engines.**

**If you mistakenly post Personal Information in our Community areas and would like it removed, you can send us an email to request that we remove it by using the _Contact Us_ link on the ChiHealth Web Sites. In some cases, we may not be able to remove your Personal Information.

This Privacy Policy does not apply to information, content, business information, ideas, concepts or inventions that you send to ChiHealth by email. If you want to keep content or business information, ideas, concepts or inventions private or proprietary, do not send them in an email to ChiHealth.

**Non-Personal Information**

Even if you do not register with or provide any Personal Information to ChiHealth, we collect Non-Personal Information about your use of the ChiHealth Web Sites. "Non-Personal Information" means information that we cannot use to identify or contact you. We may also acquire Non-Personal Information about our users from external sources. While you may use some of the functionality of ChiHealth without registration, many of the specific tools and services on the ChiHealth Web Sites require that you register with ChiHealth.

**Cookies and Web Beacons**

We collect Non-Personal Information about your use of the ChiHealth Web Sites and your use of other web sites through the use of Cookies and Web Beacons. "Cookies" are small data files that are stored on the hard drive of the computer you use to view a web site. Every computer that accesses the ChiHealth Web Sites is assigned a different cookie by ChiHealth. "Web Beacons" are graphic image files imbedded in a web page typically used to monitor activity on a web page and send back to its home server (which can belong to the host site, a network advertiser or some other third party) information from your browser, such as the IP address, the URL of the page on which the beacon is located, the type browser that is accessing the site and the ID number of any Cookies on your computer previously placed by that server.

Third parties under contract with ChiHealth may use Cookies or Web Beacons to collect Non-Personal Information about your usage of the ChiHealth Web Sites, including which health topics you have viewed. These third party advertising service providers may use this information, on our behalf, to help ChiHealth deliver advertising on the ChiHealth Web Sites as well as on other sites on the Internet based on your browsing activity on our sites. ChiHealth may further tailor the advertising on these third party sites based on additional Non-Personal Information to the extent known by ChiHealth or these third parties.

**Mobile Device Applications ("Apps")**

When you download and install one of our ChiHealth Mobile Apps onto your mobile device we assign a random number to your App installation. This number cannot be used to identify you personally, and we cannot identify you personally unless you choose to become a registered user of the App. We use this random number in a manner similar to our use of Cookies as described in this Privacy Policy. Unlike Cookies, the random number is assigned to your installation of the App itself and not a browser, because the App does not work through your browser. Therefore the random number cannot be removed through settings. If you do not want us to use the random number for the purposes for which we use Cookies, please do not use the Mobile Device App, and please use your mobile device browser to access the ChiHealth Web Sites or our mobile optimized sites. We do not obtain any information about your mobile device, other than the brand, make and model and type of operating software your device uses. Please note that certain ChiHealth Mobile Apps require registration either to use the App or to use certain functionality in the App.

**Non-Personal Information Collected by Third Parties Not Acting on ChiHealth’s Behalf**

We work with third parties to display advertising that reflects the interests and preferences of our user community. Sponsors or advertisers on the ChiHealth Web Sites may use their own Cookies, Web Beacons or other online tracking technologies in the banner advertisements served on the ChiHealth Web Sites and in emails, special promotions or newsletters we send you. Their advertisements may be displayed on the ChiHealth Web Sites or on other sites that you visit after you visit the ChiHealth Web Sites. Some advertisers use companies other than ChiHealth to serve their ads and to monitor users' responses to ads, and these companies ("Ad Servers") may also collect Non-Personal Information through the use of Cookies or Web Beacons on the ChiHealth Web Sites.

We do not control how third parties use Cookies or Web Beacons or how they manage the Non-Personal Information they gather through the use of these technologies on the ChiHealth Web Sites.

**What Choices Do I Have?**

**Cookies**

Most browser software can be set to reject Cookies. Most browsers offer instructions on how to reset the browser to reject Cookies in the "Help" section of the toolbar.

Certain Ad Servers allow you to prevent them from collecting data through the use of Cookies. In order to do so, you must Opt-out of such data collection with each individual site.

ChiHealth may combine Personal and Non-Personal Information collected by ChiHealth about you, and may combine this information with information from external sources.

**Disclosures to ChiHealth Operations and Maintenance Contractor**

ChiHealth contractors sometimes have limited access to your Personal and Non-Personal Information in the course of providing products or services to ChiHealth. These contractors include vendors and suppliers that provide us with technology, services, data analysis, research, advertising and marketing assistance and/or content for the operation and maintenance of the ChiHealth Web Sites. We contractually require that our operations and maintenance contractors: 1) protect the privacy of your Personal and Non-Personal Information consistent with this Privacy Policy and 2) not use or disclose your Personal or Non-Personal Information for any purpose other than providing the limited service or function for ChiHealth.

**Disclosures to Third Party Web Sites**

We will retain your Personal Information as long as your account is active or needed to provide you services. At any time you can remove your Personal Information or instruct us to remove it, but you should be aware that it is not technologically possible to remove each and every record of the information you have provided to ChiHealth from our servers. ChiHealth tools that collect and store Personal Information allow you to correct, update or review information you have submitted by going back to the specific tool, logging-in and making the desired changes. We will also retain your Personal Information as necessary to comply with legal obligations, resolve disputes and enforce our agreements.
