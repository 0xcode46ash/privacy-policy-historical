# Privacy Policy

### Privacy Policy

Effective October 1, 2001 

Chicago Reader, Inc. respects your privacy and will never release any personal information about you without your consent. 

When you visit one of our Web pages, our server automatically logs your Internet domain or address (IP address) and the Web location you clicked from, so we can tell how many people visit each page and how they find us. If you click on an ad, your "click-through" is recorded so we can tell advertisers how many people are responding to their ads. Neither of these procedures identifies you personally or collects any personal information about you. We do not and will not collect your name, E-mail address, or any other personal information without your consent. We do not knowingly collect any personal information from children under age 13. 

We use a third-party advertising company to serve most of the ads you see on our site. This company may use information (not including your name, address, E-mail address, or telephone number) about your visits to our and other Web sites, in combination with non-personally-identifiable information about your purchases and interests from other online and offline sources, in order to provide ads that may be of interest to you. In addition, we share information with this company about visitors' use of our Web site and others, for the purpose of managing and targeting ads and for market research analysis on our site and others. Accordingly we and our third-party advertising company may note some of the pages you visit on our site through the use of pixel tags (also called clear gifs). In the course of serving ads to our site, the advertising company may place or recognize a unique "cookie" on your computer. If you would like to learn more about the information-gathering practices of our third-party advertising company, or prevent their cookies from being set on your computer, click here for the [ DoubleClick privacy policy](http://www.doubleclick.net/us/corporate/privacy). 

On certain pages, if you choose to register for a contest, newsletter, message board, or some other purpose, we may ask for personal information such as street and/or E-mail address, phone number, consumer preferences, etc. We do not and will not release any such information unless we have your consent, or we believe in good faith that we are legally required to do so or that there is an emergency involving personal danger. Nor will we use this information to contact you in any way other than what is expressly stated in the registration. 

If you place a classified ad or make a purchase, we keep the information you give us and may use it to contact you in the future. If you use our Matches system, we may collect information about what features you use or how you move through the site, but we use this information in aggregate form only; we do not associate it with individual user names or identities. 

On some of our pages we offer content or services by providing hyperlinks to other Web sites -- for example, TicketMaster and Amazon.com. Of course these sites are not subject to our policies; we advise you to read their privacy statements. 

Given the nature of Web publishing, our privacy policies may change from time to time; any changes will be posted here as soon as they go into effect. 

If you have any questions about our privacy policy, please write to [webmaster@chicagoreader.com](mailto:webmaster@chicagoreader.com).
