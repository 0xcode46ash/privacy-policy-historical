For each visitor to our website, whether a registered user or non-registered user, our web server automatically attempts to recognize the visitor's domain name. In addition to the visitor's domain name, we also collect aggregate information on what pages visitors access. From time to time we may also collect information volunteered by the consumer, such as survey information or contest entries as well as registration information. In addition, a "cookie" will be placed on your computer â€” avoiding the need for registered users to log in each time you access our site.

Also, our ad server will have the ability to reverse a visitors domain name to find out where they live so geographic-specific ads can be placed on Web pages. Additionally, through the use of an additional cookie, the ad server will have the ability to track users by their behavior profile for the purpose of pushing advertising that matches their interests. Our email alerts also utilize tracking technology that allows us to see how many emails are opened and the email address of users who have clicked on a given story, feature or advertisement. We only use this information for internal purposes to measure the aggregate number of people who view a given email alert item.

The general background information we collect on our web registrants at the time they register may be used to notify them of changes or updates to our website, or to ascertain the demographics of our readership, but it is not shared with other organizations for commercial purposes. Subscribers are also asked at the time they register whether they want their postal and email addresses added to our mailing list. Additionally, if at any time you decide you do not want to receive email and/or snail mail from us, simply let us know by sending an email or snail mail message to the appropriate address given above. Please state in your message that you do not want to receive email and/or snail mail from our company.

In the future, we may decide to make the email addresses of those who subscribe our site available to other reputable organizations whose products or services we think would be appropriate or interesting. If you do not want us to share your email address with other companies or organizations, please let us know by sending email or snail mail to us at the addresses given above.

Again, if you prefer that your address not be shared, please contact us with your exact name and address, and we will remove your name from the list we share with other organizations.
