**Top↑** **Our Commitment To Privacy**  
Your privacy is important to us. ChinaOnTV.com considers the protection of personal privacy to be one of our most important values. This privacy policy ("Policy") gives you specific information on how we protect your privacy, how we treat personal information, and the choices you have.   
The Policy is accessible through the ChinaOnTV.com web sites in several ways, including from a link entitled "Privacy" at the bottom of the ChinaOnTV.com home page and at every point where personally identifiable information may be requested.   
This notice applies to all information collected from or submitted to the ChinaOnTV.com web site, but to make this notice easier to read we will use the term "our Web Site", which means ChinaOnTV.com. Other ChinaOnTV.com web sites may operate under their own privacy notices.  
This privacy policy complies with the Safe Harbor framework under the E.U. Data Protection Directive. In addition, ChinaOnTV.com self-certifies compliance with the Safe Harbor framework to the U.S. Department of Commerce. 

**Top↑** **Application of This Notice**  
This Notice applies only to the information collected by ChinaOnTV.com from the users of our Web Site. It does not apply to information collected by ChinaOnTV.com in any other way, including offline.  
As a condition of using the ChinaOnTV.com Site, you agree to be bound by the terms of this Policy. Additional terms and conditions which govern your use of the ChinaOnTV.com Site are contained in our User Agreement, and, as applicable, in certain other service-specific license agreements or terms of use, which you will be notified of at the time of your registration for the applicable services.  
From time to time we may add new sites, domain names or services to those listed above. Please note that this Policy applies only to this site which is owned and services maintained by ChinaOnTV.com or its corporate subsidiaries. Our Web Site contains links to other web sites operated by third parties. ChinaOnTV.com is not responsible for the privacy practices or policies of such third party web sites and this Notice does not apply to those web sites.

**Top↑** **Changes to Policy**  
You acknowledge that ChinaOnTV.com may change this Privacy Policy from time to time, based upon any changes to our Web Site and our users’ experience on it. If we make any substantial changes in this Policy, we will post a prominent announcement on our home page for a stated Notice Period. However, you should check the ChinaOnTV.com Sites regularly for these and other important announcements. Your continued use of the ChinaOnTV.com site following the Notice Period will signify that you agree to these changes.

**Top↑** **Browser identification and Cookies**  
ChinaOnTV.com sets “cookies” on your computer every time you load one of our pages. This allows us to uniquely identify your browser and therefore track which pages and advertisers you have visited through the ChinaOnTV.com domain. We cannot read “cookies” set by other Web sites, and they cannot read the ones that we set. “Cookies” allow us to recognize you when you return to our site, and we use this information for certain purposes such as choosing the advertising campaign to deliver, and passing you through to the content that you requested. You must accept and store our “cookies” in order to successfully complete a ChinaOnTV.com  browsing experience. In addition, ChinaOnTV.com automatically collects information that your browser makes available whenever you visit a Web Site. This log information includes your Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your query and one or more “cookies” that may uniquely identify your browser. We use this information to troubleshoot our services and occasionally analyze it in summary form in order to provide general, but not personal, statistics about our visitors.

**Top↑** **Separation of Information**  
While we collect a variety of amount of information about your configuration and viewing habits, we have no idea who you are. All of the information is abstracted through a randomly generated identifier that is stored in the “cookie” on your computer. Nobody on your computer can see any of the information that we collect about you, and we cannot see any of the information on your computer that we did not set. 

**Top↑** **The Information We Collect**  
Our Web Site is not set up to automatically collect personally identifiable information from each visitor to our Web Site. It does recognize the home server of visitors, but not e-mail addresses. For example, we can tell which Internet Service Provider our visitors use, but not the names, addresses or other information about our visitors that would allow us to identify the particular visitors to our Web Site. This information is used only for internal purposes by our technical support staff.  
Our Web Site does track certain information about the visits to our Web Site. For example, we compile statistics that show the numbers and frequency of visitors to our Web Site and its individual pages. These aggregated statistics are used internally to improve our Web Site and for product development and marketing purposes generally. Those aggregated statistics may also be provided to advertisers and other third parties, but again, the statistics contain no personal information and cannot be used to gather such information.

**Top↑** **Personally Identifiable Information**  
We may use internal service providers to operate our Web Site and employ other persons to perform work on our behalf, such as sending postal mail and e-mail. These persons may have access to the personally identifiable information you submit through the Web Site, but only for the purpose of performing their duties. These persons may not use your personally identifiable information for any other purpose.   
We will not provide any personally identifiable information to any other persons, except if we are required to make disclosures to the government or private parties in connection with a lawsuit, subpoena, investigation or similar proceeding. We can (and you authorize us to) disclose any such information in those circumstances.

**Top↑** **Controlled Access**  
In a few areas on our Web Site, we may ask you to provide information that will enable us to verify whether you are entitled to access and use certain information, materials and services available from our Web Site, or to enable us to enhance your site visit, to assist you with customer service or technical support issues, or to follow up with you after your visit, or to otherwise support your customer relationship with CHINAONTV.COM. It is completely optional for you to participate. However, failure to participate may mean that you cannot access and use certain information, materials and services.

For example, we may request information from you when you:

  1. Log-on to certain areas of our Web site, where you may be prompted to provide us with your username and password as a condition to gaining access to certain information, materials or services; 
  2. register or sign-up to use a service such as video downloads or other product services;
  3. subscribe to a newsletter or desire to be added to our mailing lists for other products or services;
  4. place an order for DVDs or other products;
  5. participate in a sweepstakes or other promotional offer;
  6. provide feedback in an online survey. 



In each of the instances above, we typically ask for your name, e-mail address, phone number, postal address, product preference information, username and password, as well as other similar personal information that is needed to register or subscribe you to services or offers. On occasion, we may ask for additional information to enable us to provide you with access to and use of certain information, materials and services. In the case of newsletters or mailing lists, you will be able to "unsubscribe" to these mailings at any time.

**Top↑** **Other disclosure of personal information**  
ChinaOnTV.com will not otherwise use or disclose your personal information without your consent except (i) as described in this privacy policy, or (ii) as required by law, court order or as requested by other government or law enforcement authority. This policy does not protect information you post to any on-line bulletin board, chat room, newsgroup, movie rating, e-mail or other public forum within our Web Sites.

**Top↑** **"Send to a friend" feature**  
ChinaOnTV.com offers an "e-mail a friend about this story" feature, allowing site visitors to send e-mail to friends to inform them about an article or video they might be interested in reading or viewing. In order for this feature to function, we ask for e-mail addresses for the recipient (so we know who to mail the message to) and from the sender (so we can tell the recipient who sent the e-mail). We do not store or save these addresses and you will not receive e-mail or other communications from ChinaOnTV.com or its partners as a result of having used this feature.  
"Send to a friend" is a mail service that individual visitors to ChinaOnTV.com make use of to send individual e-mails. While this tool cannot be used to send mass "spam" mailings, ChinaOnTV.com has no control over how our visitors use it, and any e-mail sent through it originates with, and is the responsibility of the sender, not ChinaOnTV.com.

**Top↑** **Links**  
Other companies which place advertising on our site also have the ability to assign their cookies to your computer in a process that ChinaOnTV.com does not control. However, cookies cannot be used to identify individuals, only machines, so these advertisers will not know who you are. When you click on links to other third party web sites, these other sites may place cookies on your computer, collect data or solicit personal information. Please refer to their privacy policy concerning these issues.

**Top↑** **Direct Response Information**  
Occasionally, advertisers may request personally identifying information from you as part of a campaign. Providing this information is always optional and clearly marked as such. Information that you provide this way is provided exclusively to the underlying advertiser and is subject to their privacy policy. Each advertiser that wishes to have this information must request it themselves.

**Top↑** **How We Use Information:**   **INFOCHINA, INC. only uses your personal information for specific purposes.**  
The personal information you provide to us when using our Web Site, such as your name, postal or e-mail address or telephone number will be kept confidential and used to support your customer relationship with ChinaOnTV.com, and to notify you of special offers, updated information and new products and services from ChinaOnTV.com, offers from third parties that we think may be of interest to you, or used by ChinaOnTV.com or third parties for the purpose of conducting market research or surveys on behalf of ChinaOnTV.com, Agents or contractors of ChinaOnTV.com who are given access to your personal information will be required to keep the information confidential and not use it for any other purpose than to carry out the services they are performing for ChinaOnTV.com  
ChinaOnTV.com may enhance or merge your information collected at our Web Site with data from third parties for purposes of marketing products or services to you.  
With respect to network advertising companies (companies that manage and provide advertising for numerous unrelated companies), to the extent that ChinaOnTV.com utilizes such advertising companies to provide advertisements on our Web Site, ChinaOnTV.com may provide them with your log-in name and any demographic information about you that we collect. Those advertising companies may combine that data with non-personally identifiable data collected by the advertising company from your computer solely for the purpose of delivering on our Web Site advertisements that are targeted to you.

**Business Transfers**. As time passes, ChinaOnTV.com may be sold along with its assets, or other transactions may occur in which customer information is one of the business assets transferred. In such a case, the customer information which we have gathered may be one of the business assets we transfer.                                        
**Disclosure for Legal Purposes.** **** The law requires that we may be required to share your personal information and non-personal information (see "Cookies" section above for examples of non-personal information) pursuant to judicial or governmental subpoenas, warrants or orders. If we are required to do so, we will, of course, obey the law. In addition, notwithstanding any term to the contrary in this Privacy Policy, we reserve the right to use and disclose share your personal and non-personal information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of this Web Site's Terms of Service, or as otherwise required by law. We can (and you authorize us to) disclose any such information in those circumstances.

We may send you information about our various products and services, or other products and services we feel may be of interest to you. Only ChinaOnTV.com (or agents or contractors working on behalf of ChinaOnTV.com and under confidentiality agreements) will send you these direct mailings.

Or, at any time you can easily opt out of receiving further marketing from ChinaOnTV.com by emailing us at [webmaster@chinaontv.com](mailto:webmaster@chinaontv.com)

**Top↑** **A Note About Children**  
The ChinaOnTV.com Sites are not directed to children under the age of 13. ChinaOnTV.com does not knowlingly market any goods, services, films, videos or other images to minors. The nature of the Internet makes it impossible for ChinaOnTV.com to know the age of its visitors, unless voluntarily acknowledged in an online questionaire response form. The ChinaOnTV.com Sites prohibit registration by, and ChinaOnTV.com will not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from, anyone under 13. This requirement will be posted at points of data collection within the ChinaOnTV.com Sites, such as registration for services or purchases.

**Top↑** **Note to Parents**  
If you have any concerns about the ChinaOnTV.com Sites, please contact us via our online form, available at [feedback@chinaontv.com](mailto:feedback@chinaontv.com).
