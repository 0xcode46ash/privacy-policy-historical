### Cookie Policy

#### What is a cookie?

In short, a cookie is a small text file that is placed on your computer or mobile device to help ensure that you get the best possible experience when you visit a website.

#### Why does the Website use cookies?

Cookies allow us to improve the Website’s content, functionality and speed, while their tracking ability also helps us to understand your likes and dislikes, which means we can respond quickly and adapt the site accordingly. We use cookies because it’s important to us that the time you spend on the Website, is as useful and intuitive as possible.

In fact without cookie placement, a website cannot remember your preferences or registration details for your next visit. For example, by allowing us to place cookies in your web browser, you don’t have to remember your username each time you sign in – a cookie helps us to remember that information for you.

The important thing to remember about all of this is that whilst some cookies are used to track your use of our Website, they cannot be used to identify you personally or tell us who you are.

Here’s a snapshot of all of the cookies we use on the Website:

**First and third-party cookies**

The cookies set by us are called ‘first-party cookies’. Those set by our partners or services we use are called ‘third-party cookies’.

Third-party cookies enable visitors to our website to see and interact with content such as information or videos provided to us by other companies. The same cookies can also help us with website analytics. 

**Session and persistent cookies**

As with most websites, we also use ‘session cookies’, which exist only for the length of time that you visit our site and are deleted once you close your browser, along with ‘permanent cookies’ also known as ‘persistent cookies’ which remain stored on your browser ready for use the next time you visit our website.

**Essential cookies**

These are required to help you access secure areas (such as your customer account pages) and to use features like our shopping cart. Essential cookies are critical because you can’t access these services without them.

**Performance and functionality cookies**

These cookies ensure the display of handy features such as videos.

**Analytics and customization cookies**

We use analytics and customization cookies to gather information on how the website is being used by our visitors and to discover how popular our marketing campaigns are. We also use the data we get to help customize the website for you and make the content you see as relevant as possible.

**Social networking cookies**

These cookies allow visitors like you to share our pages and content through third-party social networking websites.

#### Remarketing Cookies

We use remarketing cookies from Google Adwords and Facebook. Remarketing cookies allow us to show our advertisements on Google and Facebook networks to people that visit our Website.

Google may show our ads either on websites that you visit (and that joined Google Adsense program), or on websites owned by Google such as Google.com, Youtube.com, and others. 

Facebook may show our ads either on Facebook.com or on websites owned by Facebook, such as Instagram and others. 

#### How can you manage or disable cookies?

You can set or amend your web browser controls to accept or refuse cookies whenever you like, but please remember if you do choose to reject cookies, your access to some of the functionality and areas of our Website may be restricted.

Specifically, you can opt out from Google remarketing cookies [here](http://www.google.com/settings/ads), and from Facebook remarketing cookies [here](https://www.facebook.com/ads/preferences/edit/).
