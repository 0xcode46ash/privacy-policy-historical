# Christian Healthcare Ministries: Privacy policy

### What people say about CHM

Christian Healthcare Ministries has been such a blessing to many Christians across the nation. I sincerely thank my fellow members for sharing the burden of bills for my knee surgery. I received checks from CHM and was able to pay my hospital bill. The timing was just right. _-Kathy Abranovich, New Castle, PA; $9,506 need met_

General privacy statement regarding personal information

Your privacy is very important to us. Therefore, Christian Healthcare Ministries does not share, sell, or rent your personal information to third parties for their marketing purposes. We only collect personal information from you necessary to supply you with the service(s) you request from us. By supplying your personal information, you agree that we may use it to perform the service(s) you have requested or contact you in the event that we cannot perform the service(s) requested.

Medical bill privacy

When you [submit medical bills](https://web.archive.org/web/20130618204144id_/http%3A//www.chministries.org/downloadforms.aspx) to Christian Healthcare Ministries for member sharing, you will be asked to a complete a form authorizing your health care providers to share your medical information with CHM so that we can process your medical bills for sharing. This form is compliant with the federal law (HIPAA) that protects patient information. Once sent to CHM, your medical information is kept in a secure location and is only accessed by employees who need that information in order to process your bills for sharing. Christian Healthcare Ministries cannot be held liable for compromised security while medical bills are in transit. (Please be advised not to send sensitive medical information via e-mail, which is not a secure method of transmission.)

Online security policyChristian Healthcare Ministries treats your data as an asset to be protected against loss and unauthorized access. We employ security techniques to protect such data from unauthorized access by users inside and outside the organization. For example, you may access your online [Member Portal](https://www.chministries.org/members/Login.aspx) only if you have registered for access. Christian Healthcare Ministries encrypts your personal information such as user IDs, passwords, and account information over the Internet. Any information we send you is scrambled en route and decoded once it reaches your browser. However, since “perfect security” does not exist on the Internet, Christian Healthcare Ministries cannot be held liable for security infringements by unauthorized users outside the organization. 

If you wish to request a refund of any funds donated online, please call the CHM Member Assistance department at 1-800-791-6225, ext. 5993.
