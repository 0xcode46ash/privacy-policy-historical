Last Updated @ 2006-06-10 11:45 EST.   
If you have questions about your account, please email customerservice@ chocolate.com. 

Chocolate.com ([www.chocolate.com](http://www.chocolate.com/)) knows that you care how information about you is used and shared, and we appreciate your trust that we will do so carefully and sensibly. This notice describes our privacy policy. By visiting Chocolate.com, you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Statement. For Terms and Conditions of Use including return policies got to: Terms and Conditions of Use 

What Personal Information About Customers Does Chocolate.com Gather?   
The information we learn from customers helps us personalize and continually improve your experience at Chocolate.com. Here are the types of information we gather. 

Information You Give Us: We receive and store any information you enter on our Web site or give us in any other way. You can choose not to provide certain information, but then you might not be able to take advantage of some of our features. We use the information that you provide for such purposes as responding to your requests, customizing future website enhancements for you, improving our products, and communicating with you. 

Automatic Information: We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with us. For example, like many Web sites, we use "cookies," and we obtain certain types of information when your Web browser accesses www. chocolate.com. 

E-mail Communications: To help us make e-mails more useful and interesting, we may receive a confirmation when you open e-mail from Chocolate.com if your computer supports such capabilities. To opt out of newsletters send an email to customerservice@ chocolate.com, or visit the opt-out link at the bottom of the email you received.

What About Cookies?   
Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer's hard drive through your Web browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser. The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. Cookies should be enabled when you are using Chocolate.com, and we recommend that you leave them turned on when you come to [www.chocolate.com](http://www.chocolate.com/). 

Does Chocolate.com Share the Information It Receives?   
Information about our customers is an important part of our business, and we are not in the business of selling it to others. We share customer information only as described below. 

Agents: We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include fulfilling orders, delivering packages, sending postal mail and e-mail, removing repetitive information from customer lists, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, processing credit card payments, and providing customer service. They have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes. 

Promotional Offers: Sometimes we send offers to Chocolate.com customers on behalf of other businesses. When we do this, we do not give that business your name and address. We will only send such offers if you have opted in to a list on our site which describes the type of information you may want to receive. If you do not want to receive such offers, please email [customerservice@chocolate.com](mailto:customerservice@chocolate.com). 

Business Transfers: As we continue to develop our business, we may be acquired by or purchase other businesses. In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred business assets but remains subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Notice (unless, of course, the customer consents otherwise). 

Protection of Chocolate.com and Others: We release account and other personal information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law; enforce or apply our Conditions of Use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Chocolate.com users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction. Obviously, however, this does not include selling, renting, sharing, or otherwise disclosing personally identifiable information from customers for commercial purposes in violation of the commitments set forth in this Privacy Notice. 

With Your Consent: Other than as set out above, you will receive notice when information about you might go to third parties, and you will have an opportunity to choose not to share the information. 

How Secure Is Information About Me?   
We work to protect the security of your information during transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts information you input. We reveal only the last five digits of your credit card numbers when confirming an order. Of course, we transmit the entire credit card number to the appropriate credit card company during order processing. 

It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer. Be sure to sign off when finished using a shared computer. 

Which Information Can I Access?   
Chocolate.com gives you access to information about your account and your interactions with Chocolate.com for the limited purpose of updating that information. 

What Choices Do I Have?   
As discussed, you can always choose not to provide information, even though it might be needed to make a purchase or to take advantage of Chocolate.com features. 

If you do not want to receive e-mail or other mail from us, please email [customerservice@chocolate.com](mailto:customerservice@chocolate.com). If you do not want to receive Conditions of Use and other legal notices from us, such as this Privacy Notice, those notices will still govern your use of [www.chocolate.com](http://www.chocolate.com/), and it is your responsibility to review them for changes. 

The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. However, you will not be able to use such important features as 1-Click and New for You if you do not use cookies. 

Children   
Chocolate.com does not sell products directly to children. If you are under 18, you may purchase products from Chocolate.com only with the involvement of a parent or guardian. 

Conditions of Use, Notices, and Revisions   
If you choose to visit [www.chocolate.com](http://www.chocolate.com/), your visit and any dispute over privacy is subject to this Notice and our Conditions of Use, including limitations on damages, arbitration of disputes, and application of the law of the state of Massachusetts. If you have any concern about privacy at Chocolate.com, please send us a thorough description to [customerservice@chocolate.com](mailto:customerservice@chocolate.com), and we will try to resolve it. 

Our business does change, and our Privacy Notice and the Conditions of Use may also change. We may e-mail periodic reminders of our notices and conditions, unless you have instructed us not to, but you may want to check our web site to see recent changes. Unless stated otherwise, our current Privacy Notice applies to all information that we have about you and your account. 

We stand behind the promises we make, however, and will never materially change our policies and practices to make them less protective of customer information collected in the past without the consent of affected customers. 

 For additional information and/or questions, please email [customerservice@chocolate.com](mailto:customerservice@chocolate.com)
