**Our commitment to your privacy**  
The Australian Consumers’ Association and CHOICE Online respect your right to privacy and your right to control information about you.

We are committed to protecting your privacy when you visit our site or contact us in any way:  


  * You may visit the free parts of our site without identifying yourself in any way.
  

  * The credit card details you provide when you join CHOICE Online or purchase from our shop are not stored on the Internet server, are protected by encryption, state-of-the-art firewalls and building security systems and are never passed on to a third party.  

  * Your name and address and login email and password are stored on this server so that you can have access and so that you can change the details online. When you first join or register these details are sent to us in non-encrypted email.
  

  * You are welcome to review the information we hold about you.
  

  * We deal with complaints about privacy breaches quickly and appropriately.



Please read our ******[Terms and conditions](https://web.archive.org/articles/goArticle.asp?ID=100178&P=01)** for other information relating to use of CHOICE Online.

**Information we collect**  
We only collect or monitor personal information about you if it is:  


  * Required by law.
  * Necessary to protect the rights or property of CHOICE Online, ACA, any CHOICE Online user or any member of the public.
  * Necessary to lessen a serious threat to a person’s health or safety.
  * Necessary to supply what you want or give you the access you need – for example if you want to:
    * Become a member or supporter of CHOICE Online;
    * Buy something from our shop;
    * Post a message in our forums;
    * Receive one of our email newsletters;
    * Use one of our financial service choice calculators.



We keep all personal information confidential, protected by state-of-the-art firewalls and building security systems. Financial information is further protected by 128-bit SSL encryption. (See **Security of your information** , below, for details.) The only information actually stored on our website is that sufficient to identify a member for logging-in purposes. No credit card data is stored on the site.

We will not sell, rent, swap, or otherwise disclose to any third party any information provided during your membership registration or purchase from our shop except as is necessary to complete the financial transaction with our banks and for sending you physical items.

We will not use or disclose any information about you without your consent unless  


  * Required to do so by law.
  * We need to do so to provide you with the content, service or features you have requested.
  * We need to do so to protect the rights or property of CHOICE Online, ACA, any CHOICE Online user or any member of the public or to lessen a serious threat to a person’s health or safety.



We do not include on our site any functionality allowing third parties to perform ‘reverse searches’ to identify individuals from email addresses.

We may sometimes share your personal information with a service partner where you request us to provide you with goods or services from that partner.

We do collect general information on site usage which is then aggregated so we can track and analyse overall use of CHOICE Online. This helps us improve the site to give you the information, service and features you want. We do not link this information to individual users.

We do not currently collect personal information about you from other sites.

******We may contact you**  
If you are a customer we may contact you to advise you of changes to our services or other important information. You can ‘opt-in’ to receive our regular email newsletters with updates and news about CHOICE Online activities and other ACA products. For example, you can opt-in to receive the CHOICE Online e-newsletter on our ******[Home Page](https://web.archive.org/articles/goArticle.asp?ID=100975&P=01)**. Of course, if you change your mind, you can always change your option and remove your name from any list. Every email we send you will have information on how to do this.

We may contact you to ask your permission or clarify details if we want to publish any information that you have given to us, about your experiences with products or services, in surveys, correspondence, telephone calls or in our online forums, provided of course that you have given us your contact details. See Information you may choose to provide for more details.

We may from time to time need to use your email address to contact you to clarify details about your membership or purchase decisions.

We will always contact you if you make a complaint to us about our treatment of your privacy.

**Cookies**  
See our article on ******[Cookies](https://web.archive.org/articles/goArticle.asp?ID=100417&P=01)** to read more about how cookies work.

We use cookies in the following ways:  


  * In future we may offer you the convenience of accepting a permanent cookie when you become a member or supporter of CHOICE Online. This will ensure you are greeted appropriately whenever you visit the site and will offer you a quick log-in facility so that you may browse the site unimpeded. You will be able to decline this cookie if you wish.
  * When you first become a member or supporter of CHOICE Online, or during any session in which you change any of your membership information, as a convenience to you so you can avoid having to enter your username and password on every screen. This cookie is temporary and disappears when you exit your browser.
  * Once during each visit to our site, if you are a site member or supporter, as a convenience to you, so you can avoid having to enter your username and password every time you access a member-only area on the site. This cookie is temporary and disappears when you exit your browser.
  * When you visit our shop, where they are used to track your purchases – eg, the books you buy or the pay-per-view pages you request. This cookie is temporary and expires after 24 hours.



You must accept these temporary cookies in order to gain access to the members-only area on the site or to make a purchase from the shop. Note: If your browser is set to notify you when you receive a cookie, you'll be prompted to accept the cookie (Yes/No). Please select "Yes".

We may decide in the future to use cookies in other parts of our site to improve our service to you. If we do, we will post that information on these pages and notify you of it in any section that uses cookies when you first encounter it, with links to this page.

**Changing your personal information**  
Members may alter their log-in details at any time, using the prompts on the log-in pages. If you change your details, please also let us know by telephone, email or letter, so we can update your details on our membership system. Email us at [ausconsumer@choice.com.au](mailto:ausconsumer@choice.com.au), phone us on 1800 069 552 or write to us to do this.

Call us on 1800 069 552 during business hours (8:30 am to 5:30 pm Sydney time, Monday to Friday (to calculate Sydney time, go to the **[Australian White Pages world time calculator](http://www.whitepages.com.au/time.shtml)** or write to Customer Service, ACA, 57 Carrington Road, Marrickville NSW 2204, Australia.

If you need to change your credit card details, please phone or write - do not use email as it is relatively insecure.

You will need to identify yourself by giving us your full name, your address, your email address and the answer to your Clue question.

If you wish to review your file, we will mail the information in it to you within 10 working days.

If there are items you want corrected or deleted we will do so within one working day of receiving your request to do so unless we need to contact you to clarify details.

**Information you may choose to provide**  
If you take part in an online, mail or phone survey the information we collect is usually anonymous and is only used in aggregated form unless we specifically tell you otherwise at the time we collect it. You may always choose not to participate. All information gathered in this way is kept strictly confidential.

We may also collect general demographic data so we can check aggregated results against ABS statistics to ensure they’re representative, but the identification is no more specific than your postcode and is never used on an individual basis.

Where you give us information about your experiences with products or services this may be interesting to others when we publish articles on those topics. If we wish to use your experience and you’ve provided it to us in a private communication (letter, fax, email, phone call, survey) we will always ask your permission before we publish it. You always have the right to refuse or to request anonymity.

When you share your experiences in an online forum, this is a public communication to the site and we may use your post elsewhere in our work. If you post your email address publicly in the forums, this could result in your receiving unsolicited email from third parties. Please read the ******[Terms of use for our forums](https://web.archive.org/articles/goArticle.asp?aID=a100178p1.htm)** for more information. We may contact you if we need to clarify details or answer your query.

If your email address changes you can update this information on the site log-in pages, but please also email us at [](mailto:ausconsumer@choice.com.au) so we can redirect email newsletters you've requested to your new address.

**CHOICE Online partners**  
Some of the specific product- or service-choice advice we offer through our calculators uses data provided by other organisations. For example, we get current mortgage rates from ******[CANNEX](http://www.cannex.com.au/)**.

Currently all such partnerships are based on bringing up-to-date data into CHOICE Online so that you can access it via our calculators. Information about you is protected by our firewalls and is not passed to any third party. 

If in the future we form partnerships where we need to pass information you supply to another site, we will specifically state this on the relevant Web page and only proceed with your explicit permission. If we do enter into such partnerships, we will require our partners to honour this privacy policy in full with respect to your personal information.

If you have any questions, concerns or complaints about your personal information in relation to CHOICE Online partners, please email us immediately at [privacy@choice.com.au](mailto:privacy@choice.com.au) or write to us at Customer Service, ACA, 57 Carrington Road, Marrickville NSW 2204, Australia. See **Complaints** , below, for information about how we will respond.

**Security of your information**  
CHOICE Online will take all reasonable steps to ensure the personal information we have relating to you is correct and up-to-date.

Your credit-card number is protected by encryption, so it cannot be read as it is transmitted over the Internet. The encrypted data is transmitted using a secure socket layer (SSL) connection (a Netscape browser standard, adopted by Microsoft for their Internet Explorer and by some other browsers).

Look for one or more of these ‘secure connection’ indicators on your browser:  


  * A security alert window tells you that you are about to use a secure connection. Some browsers let you choose whether to display this window.
  * An SSL icon shows when you're in a secure connection.
    * A symbol of an open padlock changes to a closed padlock when you're in a secure connection.
    * A symbol of a ‘broken key’ icon is replaced by an unbroken key.
    * A blue line runs across the top of the content window.
  * The web site's address changes to one that begins with ‘https’ (check for the ‘s’).



The encrypted data go to a secure site where it is stored on a private computer that is not directly accessible via the Internet. At the secure site your credit-card number is kept in restricted-access files.

******Security of access**  
Security checkpoints are set up as part of your subscription process. You are asked to establish a password and create a security check question (your "Clue question") that only you can answer.

**IMPORTANT**  
Keep your password secret and don't forget it!!

If you do forget it, telephone our Customer Service centre on 1800 069 552 during business hours (8:30 am to 5:30 pm Sydney time, Monday to Friday – to calculate Sydney time, go to the Australian White Pages world time calculator ******[Australian White Pages world time calculator](http://www.whitepages.com.au/time.shtml)** or email us at ausconsumer@choice.com.au . You will need to identify yourself by giving us your full name, your address, your email address and the answer to your Clue question.

We aim to have online facilities to assist with this problem in future.

When you log in, you'll be asked to enter your password to protect the security of your subscription to CHOICE Online. If you want to change your password or other subscriber information, you can do so by following the prompts on the log-in pages, but please also contact us as above so we can update your details on our membership system.. You'll be asked to answer your Clue question.

Please notify us immediately if you think there has been any unauthorised use of your password or account, by emailing us at [privacy@choice.com.au](mailto:privacy@choice.com.au).
