# Privacy Policy | The Chopra Center

**Our Commitment to Privacy**

The Chopra Center ("we," "us" or "our") respects your privacy. We collect user information in an effort to improve your experience and to communicate with you about our products and services. This Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of companies that we do not own or control, or to people whom we do not employ or manage. We do not sell or rent your personal information to third parties. As described in this Privacy Policy, we do, however, share your information with our Affiliate partners, with whom we have collaborated to provide a particular service. Currently, Oprah Winfrey, OWN, Intent.com and Evolving Wisdom are our only marketing partners with whom we will share your information. We reserve the right to add, remove or change our marketing partners from time to time. You may, however, choose not to allow us to share your information with OWN or other marketing partners. To do so, please email [campaignsupport@chopra.com](mailto:campaignsupport@chopra.com)

This Privacy Policy describes the personal information we collect about you, why we collect it, how we use it and when we share it with third parties. Our Privacy Policy also describes the choices you can make about how we collect and use your information. If you have any questions about our Privacy Policy, you can always contact The Chopra Center in any of three ways:

You can tell if the Privacy Policy has changed by checking the revision date that appears at the end of this Privacy Policy.

**What kind of information does Chopra collect?**

We collect information, such as name, e-mail and postal addresses, phone number(s), birth date or age, gender, occupation, industry and personal interests from you when you visit our website, save your information with us online, visit the website of our marketing partners or participate in a contest, promotion or survey. We maintain a record of your interests and the services and features you use, and may also acquire information about you from our marketing partners, from unrelated third parties, and from our affiliates.

**How does The Chopra Center use my information?**

We will use your e-mail and postal address to send you information about Deepak Chopra and Chopra Center events and products, and our affiliates' products, services, contests, and promotions and to help us learn more about your user preferences. If you participate in a contest or promotion (online or over the phone), we may use your personal information to send you e-mails, postal mail, or telephone (including text messages) regarding our services, contests and promotions. From time to time, we may use this information to contact you via e-mail, postal mail, or telephone to learn more about your user preferences. You always have the choice to unsubscribe and not to receive marketing information or calls.

In addition, we may use information about you and your interests from us and our affiliates to help us improve our site design and your online experiences. We may contact you, subject to the choices you have made, via e-mail, postal mail, or telephone, to conduct market research and learn more about how we can improve our service offerings.

To serve you better, we may combine information you give us and information about your interests with information from third parties, including demographic information and information that is publicly available. We may also combine this information with information from our affiliates. We use that combined information to enhance and personalize your experience with us, and to communicate with you in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

**Does The Chopra Center share my information with third parties?**

If you visit the website of one of our affiliates and register for one of our programs through that affiliate, we may share information about you with that affiliate, so that the affiliate can communicate with you by e-mail or postal mail about its products and services, contests and promotions that may be of interest to you. Each of our affiliates has a privacy policy that is consistent with our own.

We also contract with service providers to maintain and manage our customer information, to fulfill sales and to communicate with our customers. We do not authorize any of these service providers to make any other use of your information.

In addition, when we collaborate with marketing partners to offer or provide products, services, contests or promotions, we may compare our customer list with theirs to identify our common customers or users. Both Chopra and our marketing partners (including Oprah, OWN, Evolving Wisdom, Intent.com, and other affiliates/marketing partner) may use that information to fulfill our respective obligations to you and for future promotional activities. Our marketing partners have their own privacy policies and your use of their websites is governed by their privacy policies.

When we offer products, services. contests and promotions, with or without a marketing partner, you may be required to provide certain personal information in order to participate. In these cases, we will give you the choice not to receive e-mail messages or other communications from us regarding our services, contests, and promotions. In this case, however, The Chopra Center may still need to contact you, for example, to notify winners and to fulfill promotional obligations.

If some or all of our business is sold, The Chopra Center will disclose your personal information to a purchaser that agrees to abide by the terms and conditions of our Privacy Policy.

The Chopra Center reserves the right to disclose information about you as required by law, in response to legal process and law enforcement requests, and as necessary to protect the property, interests and rights of The Chopra Center, its affiliates, and others.
