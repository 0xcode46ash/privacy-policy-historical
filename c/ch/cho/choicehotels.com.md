 **What about cookies and transparent gifs?**  
We use cookies to keep track of your preferences and activities during your visits (for example, customizing the site to show the brand that you originally typed in). We do not use cookies to ascertain any personally identifiable information about you apart from what you voluntarily provide us in your dealings with Choice Hotels. Cookies do not corrupt or damage your computer, programs, or computer files. You can set your browser to reject cookies if you have further concerns although doing so may adversely affect your ability to perform certain transactions, use certain functionality, and access certain content on our Web site.

We use pixels, or transparent GIF files, to help manage our online advertising.

The information that we collect and share is anonymous and not personally identifiable. It does not contain your name, address, telephone number, or email address.

We also use pixels, or transparent gif files, to send information to third-party advertising companies. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you.

Once your information reaches us, we store it behind a secure firewall that blocks access from outside our server.
