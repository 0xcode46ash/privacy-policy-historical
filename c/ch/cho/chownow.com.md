# Privacy Policy - ChowNow.com

## Effective as of July 1, 2011

We at ChowNow, LLC ("ChowNow," "we," "us," or "our") have created this privacy policy (this "Privacy Policy") because we know that you care about how information you provide to us is used and shared. This Privacy Policy relates to the information collection and use practices of ChowNow in connection with our online meal-ordering service and mobile applications (the "Service"), which are made available to you through a variety of platforms, such as through http://www.ChowNow.com (the "Website"), through Facebook, and through cell phones, personal digital assistants, and other mobile devices (collectively, the "Mobile Devices"). The Website, our Facebook page, and the Mobile Devices are collectively referred to as the "Platform."

By visiting our Website and/or using our Service on any component of the Platform, you are agreeing to the terms of this Privacy Policy and the accompanying Terms of Use.

## The Information We Collect

  1. **Personal Information**
    * When you sign up to become a Registered User or enter a promotion or our referral program, you may be required to provide us with personal information about yourself, such as your name, address, phone number, and e-mail address (collectively, the "Personal Information"). We do not collect any Personal Information from you when you use the Service unless you provide us with the Personal Information voluntarily (for example, by registering for the Service or joining our e-mail list).
  2. **Billing Information**
    * In order to submit orders through the Service, you will be required to provide certain information in addition to the Personal Information noted above. Such information may include a debit card number, credit card number, billing address, and similar information (collectively, the "Billing Information").
  3. **Geolocational Information**
    * In order to provide the Service while you are using a Mobile Device, we automatically collect geolocational information from your Mobile Device, your wireless carrier, or certain third-party service providers ("Geolocational Information"). Collection of such Geolocational Information occurs only when the Service is running on your Mobile Device. You may decline to allow us to collect such Geolocational Information, in which case ChowNow will not be able to provide certain services to you. Because your Geolocational Information is subject to abuse by others, please be sure to manage your Mobile Device and privacy preferences on the Service on an ongoing basis.
  4. **Other Information**
    * In addition to the Personal Information, the Billing Information, and the Geolocational Information, we may collect additional information (collectively, the "Other Information"). Such Other Information may include: 
      * **_From You_**. Additional information about yourself that you voluntarily provide to us, such as your gender, interests, favorite foods, and favorite restaurants.
      * **_From Your Activity_**. Information that we automatically collect when you use the Service, such as the type of Platform you're using, your IP addresses, browser type and language, referring and exit pages and URLs, date and time, amount of time spent on particular pages, what sections of the Website you visit, what you order and from which restaurants, and similar information concerning your use of the Service.
      * **_From Cookies_**. Information that we collect using "cookie" technology. Cookies are small packets of data that a website stores on your computer's hard drive so that your computer will "remember" information about your visit. We use cookies to help us collect Other Information and to enhance your experience using the Service. If you do not want the Platform to place a cookie on your hard drive, you may be able to turn that feature off on your computer or Mobile Device. Please consult your Internet browser's documentation for information on how to do this. However, if you decide not to accept cookies from us, the Service may not function properly. When the Service is made available to you through Facebook and/or other third-party sites, please be aware that these other sites maintain their own policies regarding cookies and the collection and use of information. You are responsible for reviewing those policies.
      * **_From Other Sources_**. Information that we collect or receive from Facebook and/or Mobile Devices on which you have used the Service in accordance with their terms of use and privacy policies. 



## The Information We Collect by or Through Third-Party Advertising Companies

We share Other Information about your activity on the Platform with third parties for the purpose of tailoring, analyzing, managing, reporting, and optimizing advertising you see on the Platform and elsewhere. These third parties may use cookies, pixel tags (also called web beacons or clear gifs), and/or other technologies to collect such Other Information for such purposes. Pixel tags enable us, and these third-party advertisers, to recognize a browser's cookie when a browser visits the site on which the pixel tag is located in order to learn which advertisement brings a user to a given site.

## Accessing and Modifying Personal Information and Communication Preferences

If you have registered for the Service, you may access, review, and make changes to your Personal Information and/or your Billing Information by (i) e-mailing us at info@chownow.com, (ii) calling us at 1-888-707-CHOW, or (iii) following the instructions found on the Website. In addition, you may manage your receipt of marketing and non-transactional communications by clicking on the "unsubscribe" link located on the bottom of any ChowNow marketing email. Registered Users cannot opt out of receiving transactional e-mails related to their account. We will use commercially reasonable efforts to process such requests in a timely manner. You should be aware, however, that it is not always possible to completely remove or modify information in our subscription databases.

## How We Use and Share the Information

We use the Personal Information and the Other Information to provide you the Service, solicit your feedback, inform you about our products and services and those of our third-party marketing partners, to administer our rewards, referral, and promotional programs, and to improve our Service to you. We use the Billing Information to process your orders, and we use the Geolocational Information to recommend nearby restaurants to you.

  * In an ongoing effort to better understand our users and our Service, we might analyze the Other Information in aggregate form in order to operate, maintain, manage, and improve the Service. This aggregate information does not identify you personally. We may share this aggregate data with our affiliates, agents, and business partners. We may also disclose aggregated user statistics in order to describe our products and Services to current and prospective business partners and to other third parties for other lawful purposes.
  * We may employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples may include providing marketing assistance, order fulfillment, billing, and customer service.

  * To the extent permitted by law, we may also disclose Personal Information, the Billing Information, the Geolocational Information, and the Other Information when required by law, court order, or other government or law enforcement authority or regulatory agency, or whenever we believe that disclosing the such Information is necessary or advisable, for example, to protect the rights, property, or safety of ChowNow or others.



## How We Protect Your Information

We take commercially reasonable steps to protect the Personal Information, the Billing Information, the Geolocational Information, and the Other Information from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. We use industry-standard SSL ("Secure Socket Layer") encryption technology, a secure server, and other physical and procedural safeguards to protect the security of the Personal Information. Please understand, however, that no security system is impenetrable. We cannot guarantee the security of our databases, nor can we guarantee that the information you supply will not be intercepted while being transmitted to and from us over the Internet. In particular, e-mail sent to or from the Website may not be secure, and you should therefore take special care in deciding what information you send to us via e-mail.
