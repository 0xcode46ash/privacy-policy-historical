Privacy policy

This privacy policy sets out how Vayersoft LLC uses and protects any information that you give us while using chobots.com. We ensure that our privacy policy and information practices adhere to the United States Children's Online Privacy Protection Act.

chobots.com is an online world where kids and their parents can have fun, get entertained and make friends. We in Vayersoft LLC are committed to making this family environment safe and pleasant. Should we ask you to provide certain information by which you can be identified when using this website, you can be assured that it will only be used in compliance with this privacy statement. 

Vayersoft LLC may change this policy from time to time by updating the website. In case of such changes you will receive an email notification.

The information we collect

We do not ask for any personally identifiable information from users who are under 13 years old. User accounts may only be registered by adults. Kids accounts are created by their parents.

To respond to a kids one-time request, we only ask for a valid parents email while the screen name is generated automatically.

We also enable users to chat online through our website, but all of our chat rooms are strictly monitored with a variety of security provisions. A chat filtering system automatically blocks personal information such as phone numbers and home addresses. An additional level of protection is guaranteed by Vayersoft employees who are constantly monitoring the chat.

First-time non-adult users are usually allowed to use only safe chat with a limited pictorial vocabulary unless permission from a parent has been received.

Sometimes we may ask users to provide information that is not personally identifiable, such as a visitor's favorite color, song or artist. We may link this information to personally identifiable information that we have collected. If we do so, we will treat such linked information as personally identifiable information.

What we do with the information we gather

We require this information to understand your needs and provide you with a better service, and in particular for the following reasons:

  * Internal record keeping.
  * We may use the information to improve our products and services. 
  * We may periodically send promotional emails about new games, special offers or other information which we think you may find interesting using the email address which you have provided. 
  * From time to time, we may also use your information to contact you for market research purposes.
  * We may use the information to customize the website according to your interests.



We will not sell, distribute or lease your personal information to third parties unless we have your permission or are required by law to do so. If we sell all or part of our business or make a sale or transfer of our assets or are otherwise involved in a merger or business transfer, we may transfer personally identifiable information to a third party as part of that transaction, to the extent permitted by applicable law.

Security

We are committed to ensuring that your information is secure. In order to prevent unauthorized access or disclosure, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online.
