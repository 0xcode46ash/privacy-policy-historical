# About this site

### About Chemicool

Chemicool was created by David D. Hsu. of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1996. Chemicool went online in 1996 and since then has been trying to help out anyone involved in chemistry. The information for this site was gained with the help from the following people, big thanks goes out to them all: Cabrol D.; Moore J. W and Kotz J. C. Additionally, the Perkin-Elmer Periodic Table v2.02g was used for Atomic mass, density, volume, group, heat of fusion, heat of vaporization, specific heat, and shells. 

Since the site's launch we have won some awards. "Ten Cool Sites" for Exploratorium Learning Studio's best in Science, Art, & K-12 sites would be our best achievement so far. We are working harder to get more of these awards, so keep on following our progress.
