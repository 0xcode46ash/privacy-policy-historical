Frito-Lay, Inc. ("Frito-Lay") recognizes its obligation to adhere to the highest standards of integrity for its online visitors. We have developed certain privacy practices in order to maintain these standards and to comply with the Children's Online Privacy Practices Act ("COPPA") and the guidelines established by the Children's Advertising Review Unit of the Better Business Bureau ("CARU"). On [www.fritolay.com](http://www.fritolay.com/) and the related Frito-Lay web sites, we are dedicated to providing kids of all ages with a safe and secure place to have fun online. **If you have any questions or comments about this site, or the privacy policy, you should contact Frito-Lay Consumer Affairs at Box 35645, Dallas, Texas 75235-0645 or call 1-800-352-4477 weekdays between the hours of 9:00 a.m. and 4:30 p.m. CST.**

Frito-Lay only collects personal information from online visitors on a voluntary basis. We do not require personal information to visit [fritolay.com](http://www.fritolay.com/) or our other web sites; however, we do require some information for visitors to register for specific promotions or programs or to participate in surveys or auctions. **As required by COPPA, Frito-Lay will not require visitors to give more information than is reasonably necessary to participate in an online activity.** On any Frito-Lay registration page, we will request the visitor's date of birth, email address and other contact and demographic information related to the particular program, promotion, auction or survey. **Frito-Lay does not collect personal information online from children under 13 years of age on this Site.** Frito-Lay does collect personal information online from children under 13 years of age on [www.eploids.com](http://www.eploids.com/) through the eploidsÂ® auction registration process, which has been designed to obtain parental consent consistent with COPPA. (Go to [www.eploids.com](http://www.eploids.com/) for more information.) On all of our sites, Frito-Lay reserves the right to limit participation in particular online programs or promotions to visitors 18 years of age or older.

Frito-Lay uses information submitted on the registration pages to keep track of visitors' participation in programs or promotions, to respond to comments or questions, to notify a visitor if he or she is the potential winner of a promotion, to send visitors special messages regarding Frito-Lay's sites, products, programs or promotions, to provide visitors with access to special areas or features of our site(s), and for internal purposes. **Frito-Lay will not sell, rent, individually post online or otherwise disclose any personal information about our visitors to third parties for marketing purposes.** Frito-Lay may disclose personal information to comply with a subpoena or applicable law or process. Sometimes, we hire trusted companies to help us with our web sites, programs and promotions, and those companies may have limited access to personal information for the sole purpose of performing their services, subject to confidentiality obligations. Frito-Lay may collect non-personal information from our online visitors (such as the visitor's type of browser, operating system and domain names), but we do not collect personal information in this process. The non-personal information we collect enables us to track the total number of visitors to each of our sites in an aggregate form, and is used by Frito-Lay to improve and update our sites, products and services. Aggregate (non-personal) information may be shared with 3rd parties. 

**COPPA requires that parents be allowed to review their child's personal information, have it deleted and refuse to allow further collection or use of that personal information.** No personal information is collected on this Site from children under 13 years of age. 

If visitors send us any comments, suggestions, information, ideas, concepts, knowledge or techniques, Frito-Lay is free to use the information worldwide, in perpetuity, without acknowledgement or compensation, for any purpose, including developing, manufacturing or marketing products and/or modifying or improving our web site(s).
