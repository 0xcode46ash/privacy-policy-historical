However, to register for the Service or to participate in the Surveys, whether at our Site or at one of our partners' sites, you may be asked to provide your email address. To serve you better and send you the most relevant offers, we may also seek other personally and non-personally identifiable information about you from you, our marketing partners where you have given them your consent, or where such information is otherwise publicly available. Such information may include postal, demographic or transactional information.

> If you provide us with your email address or other personal information, or if we obtain such information about you from you or from one of our marketing partners, we will retain and use that information solely for the purpose of sending you advertisements, offers and Surveys from selected marketers in categories of interest to you. When necessary, we may also use your personal information to ensure compliance with Company policies and applicable law. 
> 
> In addition, if you participate in a Survey, you will be asked to provide certain information, personal and not, in order for us to determine your suitability for particular Surveys, as certain Surveys may be directed only to those participants who meet a particular demographic profile. You will be asked to answer certain “pre-qualification” questions on a pre-qualification page hosted us by. The information we collect on this page will be used to determine whether you are eligible to participate in the Survey and will also be maintained by us to enable us to provide you with more relevant offers and information in the future.

We collect this information through the use of technologies such as “cookies” and “IP addresses”, which are discussed in greater detail below.
