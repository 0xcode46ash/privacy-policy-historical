The information is used to evaluate the use of the website and to produce reports on the website activities and to provide further services linked to the use of the website and the internet for the purposes of market research and rendering the web pages user friendly. This information is also when appropriate passed on to a third party insofar as this is legally required or insofar as the third party has a contract to work on this data. In no case is your IP-address linked to other data by Google. The IP addresses are anonymised, so that no attribution is possible (IP masking).

Within the online shop on our website (for more details see under Number III) we also employ tools for the continual optimisation of our online marketing. These measures which we include are there for the protection of our legitimate interest on the basis of Art. 6 (1) f) GDPR.

  1. **Google AdWords**



We employ the "AdWords" procedure of Google in order to place adverts in Google’s advertising network in such a way that they are displayed to users who are potentially interested in our adverts. In this case when they are accessed on our and other websites on which Google’s advertising network is active, a code is executed by Google and so-called marketing tags (also known as web beacons) are attached. With their help, an individual cookie is stored on your device (instead of cookies alternative technologies can also be used). This notes which websites you have visited and which contents interested you or which pages you clicked on; furthermore technical information and other details are stored for further use. Moreover an individual “conversion cookie” is installed. The information obtained with the help of this is used by Google to establish conversion statistics for us. We only learn, however, the anonymous total number of users who have clicked on our advert and who have been transferred onwards to a page which has a marketing tag attached to it. The users‘ data are processed under a pseudonym within Google’s advertising network, unless they have chosen some other setting. The information collected is transmitted to Google and saved on their servers in the USA. You will find further information as to the use of the data by Google and options regarding settings and objections as well as the settings for the display of adverts under  <https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads> or <https://adssettings.google.com/authenticated>.

  1. **Google Retargeting  **



We use Google’s retargeting technologies. This makes it possible to send to users of our website in a targeted fashion advertising linked to their interests such as they have already shown for our website and our products. The display of adverts follows on from a  cookie-based analysis of the previous behaviour of the user, but no personal data is stored during this process. In the retargeting a cookie is installed on your device in order to collect anonymised data concerning your interests. This means that you are shown adverts which are most probably more related to the products which interest you. You can prevent the storing of cookies for the purpose of retargeting by installing the following plugin: <https://www.google.com/settings/ads/onweb/>. You can find further information about the data processing connected with retargeting by Google under <http://www.google.com/policies/technologies/ads/>.

  1. **Bing Ads**



We employ the conversion and tracking tool “Bing Ads”. Bing Ads is provided by the Microsoft Corporation, One Microsoft Way, Redmond, WA 98052-6399, USA (hereinafter “ ** _Microsoft_** ”). In the context of Bing Ads cookies are stored on your device by Microsoft, in order to make possible an analysis of the use of our website insofar as you reached our website via Bing (“conversion tracking”). We (and Microsoft) can thus recognise whether you clicked on an advert which led you to our website or to a specific page you had in mind. With this we learn simply the total number of users who clicked on an advert and were then directed to our website. If you would prefer not to participate in conversion tracking you can deactivate the installation of cookies with a browser setting or utilise the opt-out-page of Microsoft: <http://choice.microsoft.com/en-EN/opt-out>. You will find further information about Microsoft’s data protection in the Microsoft data protection statement: <https://privacy.microsoft.com/de-de/privacystatement>.

  1. **Bing Ads Universal Event Tracking (UET)**



We use technologies from Microsoft with which, based on Microsoft‘s Bing adverts, data is collected and stored from which user profiles are created using pseudonyms. This makes it possible for us to follow your activities on our website if you came to it via Bing adverts. If you reach our website via a Bing advert a cookie is installed on your device. On our website a UET tag is integrated; this is a code, via which, together with the cookie, non-personal data about the use of the website is stored. The information collected is sent to the Microsoft server in the USA where it is stored basically for a maximum of 180 days. You can prevent the collection and processing of the data by deactivating the setting of cookies. In addition, under certain circumstances Microsoft can by means of so-called cross-device-tracking follow your use of the site on several of your devices, meaning that it is in a position to display adverts relevant to your interests on Microsoft websites. You can deactivate this option via the following link: <http://choice.microsoft.com/en-en/opt-out>. You can find more information about the analysis services of Microsoft and about data protection in Microsoft and Bing under: <https://help.bingads.microsoft.com/#apex/3/de/53056/2> or <https://privacy.microsoft.com/de-de/privacystatement>.
