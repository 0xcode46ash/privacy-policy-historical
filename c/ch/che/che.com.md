## Privacy Policy

Chemical Engineering takes your privacy very seriously. We have developed this privacy policy to protect the information gathered from our site visitors.

Our web server identifies the domain name and IP address of each visitor to www.che.com, but not the e-mail address. Our log files collect and store domain name information. We also track information, in aggregate, on pages and features that users access.

Chemical Engineering does not sell such information to third parties. The information we collect may be used for audits, statistical analysis, product development and advertising sales efforts. We disclose site usage information to third parties only in aggregate.

Subscribers to our online and offline products and services are asked to provide Personally Identifiable Information (name, e-mail address, job title, company). Chemical Engineering does not share this information with third parties. Each issue of our e-newsletters, delivered via e-mail, offer the opportunity to “opt out” of our distribution list.

Chemical Engineering may modify this policy from time to time to reflect legal, technological or other developments. Any such modified policy will appear at this URL.
