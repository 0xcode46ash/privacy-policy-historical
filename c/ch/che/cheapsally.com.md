## Privacy Policy

Flank Marketing, LLC, respects our visitors’ right to privacy online. We hold your information in confidence. 

**Asking for your Information**  
We will sometimes ask you for personal information such as your name, address, e-mail and other details. By providing your information to us, we can deliver the most relevant information to you only when you have requested to hear about it. 

When we ask for personal information for any reason, we will provide a link to this policy statement to make our intentions clear. 

**Personal Privacy Information**  
Flank Marketing, LLC, will take all appropriate steps to keep your personal information confidential. Those steps include limiting access to visitor information databases, communicating this policy statement to all employees and establishing and enforcing penalties for violating this statement.

Flank Marketing will not sell, rent, or give away our visitors’ personal information to others for use in selling products or services. We will vigorously enforce all privacy agreements we have with other organizations. By signing up at CheapSally.com or signing up for CheapSally.com on any other medium, you give Flank Marketing, LLC the right to use your email address for any other web properties owned by Flank Marketing, LLC.

We may communicate with visitors via e-mail or other online delivery devices only if the visitor agrees to receive those communications. Members of the public, who believe they are receiving our communications in error or no longer desire to receive them, should inform us and we will remove those clients’ names from our mailing lists. Flank Marketing, LLC, will be judicious in the use of e-mail and paper mail to communicate with members of the public. We will, at all times, put ourselves in the place of the recipients of our mail and treat recipients as we ourselves would like to be treated.  
Flank Marketing, LLC, may team with others to provide our visitors with enhanced Internet services. In providing such services, our partners also may request personal information from our clients. We prohibit these partners from selling or giving away our visitor information and we require them to have a posted Privacy Policy, so that visitors may review it before providing personal information to our partners.

In addition, we may provide links to sites that operate under different privacy practices. We encourage our visitors to review the privacy policies of such sites before providing any personal information. Although we cannot control the use of information provided to such third parties, we will try to link only to those sites that have suitable privacy policies.
