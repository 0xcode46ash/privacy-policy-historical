# CheetahMail: Privacy

To CheetahMail, our clients and our subscribers, there is no issue of greater importance than user privacy. Since personal privacy integrity is at the very core of our business, CheetahMail's success depends implicitly upon its ability to maintain the trust of the people viewing our products. Toward this end, we have two distinct policies: 

  * Client Data Policy: As our client, you have exclusive ownership and rights to your subscriber data. 
  * E-Mail Recipient Policy: We send only to lists that have been warranted to us to be composed of opted-in customers of our clients. Any e-mail recipient may request at any time to be removed from those lists, and we will comply with that request within one business day. In addition, we will thoroughly investigate any allegations made by e-mail recipients relating to unsolicited e-mail. 



**Information Collection & Use**  
CheetahMail is the sole owner of the information collected on the site. We do not sell, share, or rent this information. CheetahMail collects the information and uses it exclusively to send only appropriate information to users who request it. CheetahMail collects information on our site in the following ways: 

**Contact Us Form**  
Requires a user to provide contact and company information. 

**Log Files**  
CheetahMail uses IP addresses to monitor and administrate our site and collect data to analyze trends. IP addresses are not linked to any personally identifiable information. Log file CheetahMail collects may include browser type, IP address, URL accessed, status code and number of bytes returned. 

**Links**  
The CheetahMail website contains links to other sites. CheetahMail is not responsible for the privacy practices of these sites. We recommend users read the privacy statements of each website. 

**Opt Out**  
All email communications sent by CheetahMail have clear instructions on how to unsubscribe from future communications. This can be accomplished in several ways including clicking on the unsubscribe link within an email or replying to the email indicating you no longer wish to receive communications. 

**Security Statement**  
Along with privacy, security is of utmost importance at CheetahMail. Therefore, substantial investments have been made in CheetahMail's technology platform including high-end servers and hosting, database applications, and security technologies. 

**Correct/Update**  
If a user receives a CheetahMail delivered email communication on behalf of a client or signs up to a CheetahMail product update newsletter, they will be informed of how to change or correct their personal information. 

**Notification of Changes to our Privacy Policy**  
When a change to our privacy policy occurs, we will post a notification on our homepage. If there is a material change to personally identifiable information, the user will be notified by email and they may opt out. 

**Anti-Spam Statement**   
CheetahMail practices permission-based email marketing. Cheetah Mail does not send unsolicited email or work with companies who do so. 

**Legal Disclaimer**  
Though we make every effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose personal information when required by law wherein we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served on our Web site. 

**Our Clients**  
CheetahMail offers our clients the most flexibility in the email marketing industry through a full range of email marketing solutions. Our cutting-edge products are designed in conjunction with the world's leading direct marketers and retailers. 

In some cases CheetahMail assists our clients by collecting subscriber demographics and interests in hopes of serving subscribers with the most relevant e-mail publications possible. CheetahMail supports delivery of the email with sophisticated tracking technology allowing our clients to send very targeted communications to their audience. CheetahMail also provides our clients with ability to analyze data and transfer this data back to the client. Client data is kept private and never shared with other clients. 

Clients can use the CheetahMail application to deliver their own email campaigns in a self-service product. CheetahMail has a strict policy against using our application for sending unsolicited email. CheetahMail reserves the right to terminate any client relationship which does adhere to a strict opt in permission policy.
