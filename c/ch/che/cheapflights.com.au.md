**Email addresses**  
We do not want you to receive unwanted email from us. We try to make it easy to opt-out of any service you have asked to receive. We would not provide your email address to a third party unless you asked us to. For example, competition entries require you to provide an email address - in such cases you often have the option to receive information from the prize provider.
