# Privacy Policy

**Introduction**

This policy (together with our [Terms of Website Use](https://web.archive.org/terms-and-conditions/) and any other documents referred to on it) sets out the basis on which any personal data we collect from you, or that you provide to us, will be processed by us.  Please read the following carefully to understand our views and practices regarding your personal data and how we will treat it.

The website at [www.cheapflights.co.uk](http://www.cheapflights.co.uk/) (" **our** **site** ") is a site operated by Momondo Group Limited, to which the words "we", "us" and "our" refer.

We are registered in England and Wales under company number 03914064.  The address of our registered office and principal place of business is One Alfred Place, London WC1E 7EB, United Kingdom.  For the purposes of the Data Protection Act 1998 ("the **Act** ") we are the data controller, and are registered in the Data Protection Register under registration number Z7714834.

If you have questions about this policy please contact us via [Feedback](https://web.archive.org/help/feedback/) or by post (marked for the attention of the Customer Services Manager) at the address given above.

 **Information that we may collect from you**

We may collect and process the following data about you:-

  * information that you provide by filling in forms on our site.  This includes information provided at the time of registering to use our site, subscribing to our service, posting material or requesting further services.  We may also ask you for information when you enter a competition or promotion sponsored by us, and when you report a problem with our site;


  * a record of any correspondence with you;


  * your responses to our requests to complete surveys that we use for research purposes, although you do not have to respond to them;


  * details of which of our services you are interested in;


  * details of your visits to our site including, but not limited to, traffic data, location data, web logs and other communication data, whether this is required for our own billing purposes or otherwise, and the resources that you access;


  * information about your computer, including where available your IP address, operating system and browser type, for system administration and to report aggregate information to our advertisers; and


  * information obtained from cookies, as to which please see below.



 **Email addresses**

We do not want you to receive unwanted email from us. We try to make it easy for you to opt out of any service that you have asked to receive. If you sign up to our email newsletters we do not sell, exchange or give your email address to a third party save as explained in the section below entitled "disclosure of your information".

Email addresses are collected via our site, co-registration partners and third party marketing lists and promotions. Users have to opt in to receive our newsletter and a verification email is sent. We are clearly and conspicuously named at the point of collection.

We use email addresses to send our weekly Travel Deals Alert Newsletter and occasional mailings to assist in market research.

We sometimes run competitions with our partners and competition entries may require you to provide an email address. These email addresses may be shared with the partner running the competition. We try to make it very clear when this is the case, and we disclaim any responsibility for subsequent use or distribution of email addresses by our partners.

If you no longer wish to receive our newsletter and promotional communications, you may opt out of receiving them by following the instructions included in each newsletter or communication or by emailing us via [Feedback](https://web.archive.org/help/feedback/). Alternatively, please visit [Unsubscribe](https://web.archive.org/email-newsletter/unsubscribe/) to be removed from future communications.

The security of your personal information, including your email address and postcode, is important to us. We follow generally-accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during registration and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, though we strive to use commercially-acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

If you have any questions about the security on our website, please contact by us via [Feedback](https://web.archive.org/help/feedback/) and one of our designated correspondents will respond to your query.

If we decide to change our email practices, we will post those changes to this privacy policy, the homepage of our site, and other places that we deem appropriate so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.

 **Where we store your personal data**

The data that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the European Economic Area (" **EEA** "). It may also be processed by staff operating outside the EEA who work for us or for one of our suppliers. By submitting your personal data, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing. We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this privacy policy.

 **Uses made of the information**

We use information held about you in various ways including:

  * if we or substantially all of our assets are acquired by a third party, in which case personal data held by us about our customers will be one of the transferred assets.


  * if we are under a duty to disclose or share your personal data in order to comply with any legal obligation, or in order to enforce or apply any of our terms and conditions, including our Website Terms of Use; or to protect the rights, property, or safety of us, our customers, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organisations for the purposes of fraud protection and credit risk reduction;


  * in the form of aggregated information about our users in order to provide them with data about target audiences.



 **Your rights**

You have the right to ask us not to process your personal data for marketing purposes. We will usually inform you (before collecting your data) if we intend to use your data for such purposes or if we intend to disclose your information to any third party for such purposes. You can exercise your right to prevent such processing by checking certain boxes on the forms we use to collect your data.  You can also exercise the right at any time by contacting us via [Feedback](http://www.cheapflights.co.uk/help/feedback/).

Our site may, from time to time, contain links to and from the websites of our partner networks, advertisers and affiliates.  If you follow a link to any of these websites, please note that these websites have their own privacy policies and that we do not accept any responsibility or liability for these policies.  Please check these policies before you submit any personal data to these websites.

 **Access to information**

The Act gives you the right to access information held about you. Your right of access can be exercised in accordance with the Act. Any access request may be subject to a fee of £10 to meet our costs in providing you with details of the information we hold about you.

 **Access to Personally Identifiable Information**

If your email address changes, or if you no longer desire our service, you may correct, update, delete or deactivate your details by making the change on our member information page, the "Update Details" tab which is located in every newsletter, or by contacting us via [Feedback](https://web.archive.org/help/feedback/).

Log files and Javascript tracking are used for general web analytics such as counting unique users, visitors and page impressions. We record details of individual accesses to our site in order to provide a more relevant site for you. This information may include details of internet IP addresses and browser types. Access, by third parties, to full log files may be allowed under controlled circumstances for the purposes of auditing. The log files and tracking are integral to our site as they allow us to verify to clients that traffic is free from spam and fraudulent visitors.
