 **Validity  
** Cheapflights Media Ltd reserves the right to amend this policy from time to time.

Our electronic privacy policy (P3P) states that our policy is valid for 52 weeks from the time it is loaded by a client.

 **Email addresses**  
We do not want you to receive unwanted email from us. We try to make it easy to opt-out of any service you have asked to receive. If you sign-up to our email newsletters we do not sell, exchange or give your email address to a third party.

Email addresses are collected via the Cheapflights.co.uk website, co-registration partners and third party marketing lists and promotions. Users have to physically opt-in to receive the Cheapflights.co.uk newsletter and a verification email is sent. Cheapflights Media Ltd is clearly and conspicuously named at the point of collection.

Cheapflights Media Ltd uses email addresses to send its weekly Travel Deals Alert Newsletter and occasional mailings to assist in market research.

We sometimes run competitions with our partners and competition entries may require you to provide an email address. These email addresses may be shared with the partner running the competition. We try to make it very clear when this is the case and we have no responsibility for subsequent use or distribution of email addresses by our partners.

If you no longer wish to receive our newsletter and promotional communications, you may opt-out of receiving them by following the instructions included in each newsletter or communication or by emailing us via [Feedback](https://web.archive.org/help/feedback/). Alternatively, please visit [Unsubscribe](https://web.archive.org/email-newsletter/unsubscribe/) to be removed from future communications.

The security of your personal information, including your email address and postcode, is important to us. We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during registration and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100 per cent secure, however. Therefore, though we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

If you have any questions about the security on our website, please visit our "Contact Us" page and a designated Cheapflights Media Ltd correspondent will respond to your query.

If we decide to change our email practices, we will post those changes to this privacy statement, the homepage, and other places we deem appropriate so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.

We reserve the right to modify this privacy statement at any time, so please review it frequently. If we make material changes to our email practices, we will notify you here, by email, and by means of a notice on our home page.

 **Access to Personally Identifiable Information  
** If your email address changes, or if you no longer desire our service, you may correct, update, delete or deactivate your details by making the change on our member information page, the "Update Details" tab which is located in every newsletter, or by visiting the [Contact Us](http://www.cheapflights.co.uk/help/contact-us/) page.
