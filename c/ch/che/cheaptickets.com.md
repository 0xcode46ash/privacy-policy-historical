# Cheap Tickets: Privacy Statement

CHEAP TICKETS, INC. PRIVACY POLICY  
Effective September 29, 2000

Cheap Tickets, Inc. ("Cheap Tickets") is committed to protecting your privacy while you are visiting [www.cheaptickets.com](http://www.cheaptickets.com/) (the "Site"). That's why Cheap Tickets created the Cheap Tickets Privacy Policy. Rest assured - you're in control with Cheap Tickets. 

The purpose of this privacy policy is to inform you as to what information may be collected from you when visiting the Site, how such information will be used by Cheap Tickets and/or other persons or entities, with whom such information may be shared, your choices regarding the collection, use and distribution of such information, your ability to edit, update, correct or delete such information and the security procedures that we have implemented to protect your privacy. 

The Information We Collect  
To make your travel planning easier and to ensure optimized availability of the system, Cheap Tickets asks you to register before searching for low airfares. Your personal information is then stored in a secure profile that Cheap Tickets uses to process your airline ticket purchases and contact you in the event of a customer service request. To complete your profile, Cheap Tickets requires you to enter the following personal information: first name, last name, phone number, e-mail address, login name, password, and security information. 

Cheap Tickets also may ask you for personal information (e.g., credit card information, shipping address, etc.) at other times, including, but not limited to, when you (a) make travel arrangements; (b) enter a sweepstakes, contest or other promotion sponsored by Cheap Tickets; and (c) report a problem with the site. If you contact Cheap Tickets, Cheap Tickets may keep a record of that correspondence. Wherever Cheap Tickets collects personal information, Cheap Tickets makes an effort to include a link to this privacy policy on that page. 

Please also be aware that Cheap Tickets uses commonly employed Internet technologies to collect additional information. For example, Cheap Tickets uses "cookies" to determine how users reach the Site and to track general usage patterns once a user is on the Site. This information is collected and analyzed in the aggregate in order to improve the function, content, overall appearance and capability of the Site. 

"Cookies" are small pieces of information that are transferred by a web site and stored by your web browser on your computer's hard drive. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies. Although Cheap Tickets requires that your web browser accept cookies to access the Site, Cheap Tickets does not store any personally identifiable information in them. 

Who is Collecting Your Information  
When you are on the Site and are asked for personal information, you are sharing that information with only Cheap Tickets except as set forth elsewhere in this privacy policy. Promotions that run on Cheap Tickets may be sponsored by companies other than Cheap Tickets or may be co-sponsored by Cheap Tickets and another company. Some or all data collected during a promotion may be shared with the co-sponsor(s). If data will be shared, you will be notified prior to the time of data collection or transfer. You can decide not to participate in the promotion if you don't want your data to be shared. Currently, most Cheap Tickets promotions are limited to United States or North American residents. 

How Your Information is Used and With Whom Your Information is Shared  
When you make travel arrangements with Cheap Tickets and you provide information about yourself, Cheap Tickets uses this information to complete your order, fulfill any customer service requests and provide promotional information via e-mail. Cheap Tickets does not share this information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to complete your order and fulfill your travel arrangements. Such other parties may include, but shall not be limited to, appropriate airlines and the SABRE reservation system. 

Cheap Tickets shares web site usage information about visitors to the Site with a leading third-party advertising company for the purpose of targeting our Internet banner advertisements on the Site and other web sites. For this purpose, we and our third-party advertising company note some of the pages you visit on the Site through the use of pixel tags (also called clear gifs). The information collected by our third-party advertising company through the use of these pixel tags is not personally identifiable. For more information about our third-party advertiser, please click here [http://www.privacychoices.org](http://www.privacychoices.org/). To opt out of the targeting program, please click here <http://www.privacychoices.org/optout.htm>. 

Cheap Tickets does not use or share the personally identifiable information provided to us online in ways unrelated to the ones described in this privacy policy without also providing you an opportunity to opt-out of or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses. 

Correcting Inaccuracies in Your Information  
You can always (a) view, update and/or correct the information in your profile and (b) "opt-out" of receiving information about Cheap Tickets' special travel promotions by visiting our homepage at [http://www.cheaptickets.com](http://www.cheaptickets.com/), logging in with a valid Login Name and Password, and then selecting "Profile" from the Reservations Menu. 

Protection of Children  
Although the Site is a general audience website that is not specifically designed for or targeted at children, the protection and safety of children is very important to Cheap Tickets and we therefore encourage parents and guardians to participate in and supervise the online activities of their children. We do not knowingly collect, use or disseminate any personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13. If, however, we become aware that personally identifiable information regarding a child under the age of 13 has been collected at the Site, we will use such information for the sole purpose of contacting a parent or guardian of the child to obtain verifiable parental consent. If we cannot obtain consent after a reasonable period of time, or if when contacted a parent or guardian requests that we do not use or maintain such information, we will delete it from our records. Upon request by a parent or guardian, we will provide a description of the specific types of personal information collected from a child who is under the age of 13\. 

Security  
The importance of security for all personally identifiable information associated with our customers is of utmost concern to Cheap Tickets. Cheap Tickets exercises great care in providing secure transmission of your information from your personal computer to our servers. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while Cheap Tickets strives to protect your personal information, Cheap Tickets cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us. Once Cheap Tickets receives your transmission, Cheap Tickets makes its best effort to ensure the security on its systems. To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, Cheap Tickets has put in place sophisticated physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information Cheap Tickets collects on the Site. For more details on our No Worry Security, simply [CLICK HERE](https://web.archive.org/web/20011007194142id_/http%3A//www.cheaptickets.com/aboutus/security.html). 

Your login name and password are highly sensitive information. Although Cheap Tickets takes precautions to prevent unauthorized use of your personal information, you must also be careful to safeguard login name and password. You are solely responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your passwords and any account information. Cheap Tickets will never ask you for your password in an unsolicited phone call or e-mail message. Remember to sign out of your Cheap Tickets account and close your browser window when you have finished your work to ensure that others cannot access your personal information and correspondence (a) if your computer is accessible to others, (b) if you share a computer with someone else, and/or if you are using a computer in a public place like a library or an Internet caf√©. 

Third Party Links  
The Site may contain links to web sites operated and maintained by third parties over which we have absolutely no control. The information practices of those web sites are not covered by this privacy policy. Any information you provide to third party web sites will be governed under the terms of each such web site's privacy policy. We have no responsibility or liability whatsoever for the content, actions or policies of third party web sites. We encourage you to read the privacy policies of all third party web sites that link to the Site because such privacy policies may be materially different from this privacy policy. An example of such a third party web site is our discount hotel reservation system that is provided by the Hotel Reservations Network. 

Questions, Comments or Concerns  
If you have questions or comments about this privacy policy, or if you are concerned that we have not followed the principles set forth in this privacy policy, please send an email to our Internet Privacy Administrator at [privacy@cheaptickets.com](mailto:privacy@cheaptickets.com) or write us at: Cheap Tickets Inc, Attention: Internet Privacy Administrator, 1440 Kapiolani Blvd., Suite 800, Honolulu, Hawaii, 96814, and we will address your question, comment or concern promptly. 

Other Information You Should Know  
Cheap Tickets may disclose the information that we collect about you when we have reason to believe that it is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against persons or entities who may be causing injury to you, to us or to others. We may also disclose your information when we believe the law requires it. Cheap Tickets may, in its sole discretion, revise this privacy policy at any time and all such revisions shall be effective when posted. Accordingly, Cheap Tickets encourages you to periodically review this privacy policy in order to keep apprised of Cheap Tickets' current privacy practices. 

Thank you for trusting Cheap Tickets and helping us to help you save money on all your travel needs.
