| **AGENTS**  
---  
Like many other sites, this Site uses cookies to personalize your experience, and to speed up the member sign in process. Cookies are information stored on your computer. Cookies are not used to track your movement or perform any function other than to enhance your use of our Site and are not linked to personal information. If your browser does not support cookies, or you have not enabled cookies in your browser, many of these time-saving features will not work properly. Also, you need to have cookies enabled in your browser if you want to enter the member’s area. 

A cookie may be placed by our advertising server.   These cookies are used only for purposes of tracking the effectiveness of advertising served by us on our Site.  No personal information about you is gathered by the use of these cookies.  Cookies may be placed by our third-party advertising companies who may use aggregated statistics about your visits to this and other web sites in order to provide advertisements about travel-related goods and services that you may be interested in.  The information collected does not include your personal information.  This privacy statement covers the use of cookies by CheapOair only and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.  
  
  
**THIRD PARTY TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES**  
---  
We use a third-party tracking service called Google Analytics that uses tracking technology to track non-personally identifiable information about visitors to our site in the aggregate.

We use an outside shipping company to ship paper tickets, and a credit card processing company to bill you for travel products. These companies do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any other purposes.  
  
  
**SECURITY**  
---  
  
The security of your personal information is important to us. When you enter sensitive information (such as credit card number) on our registration or order forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). [To learn more about SSL, follow this link <http://www.verisign.com/ssl/ssl-information-center/how-ssl-security-works/index.html>]

All of our secure servers use a high-grade encryption key (RC4 with 128 bi t secret key). While secure mode provides SSL encryption, pages will take longer to download. Most users choose to sign up or sign in using standard mode to achieve quicker response time. 

If you receive browser warnings when going from secure mode pages to non-SSL pages, it is most likely a warning that you are switching servers. As long as your data is entered on a secure mode page, it will only be transmitted to a secure server.

We follow accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.  We urge you to take every precaution to protect you personal data when you are on the Internet. Change your passwords often, use a combination of letters and numbers, and make sure you use a secure browser.

To ensure that your credit, debit or charge card is not being used without your consent, we may validate your name, address and contact number supplied by you during the booking process against appropriate third party databases. By accepting these terms and conditions you agree and authorize us to carry out such verification checks as stated herein. In performing these checks, you acknowledge and concur that such personal information you provide to us may be disclosed to a registered Credit Reference Agency which may keep a record of such information in whole or in part. You can rest assured that this verification process is performed for the sole purpose to verify and confirm your identity, and that this process does not perform a credit check, and your credit rating will not be affected whatsoever. All information provided by you to us is securely processed in strict accordance with the Data Protection Act of 1998. 

If you have any questions about security on our Web site, you can send email us at [cservice@CheapOair.ca](mailto:cservice@CheapOair.ca)  
  
  
**GOVERNMENT AND LEGAL**  
---  
We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our Site.  
  
**ACCESS TO PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION**  
---  
  
If your personally identifiable information changes, or if you no longer wish to use our services, you may correct, update, delete or deactivate it by emailing our  Customer Support at [cservice@CheapOair.ca](mailto:cservice@cheapoair.ca) or by contacting us by telephone or postal mail at the contact information listed below.  
  
**CHILDREN'S PRIVACY PROTECTION**  
---  
CheapOair understands the importance of protecting children's privacy in the interactive online world. The Site is not designed for, or intentionally targeted at, children 13 years of age or younger.  It is not our policy to intentionally collect or maintain information about anyone under the age of 13.  
  
**OPT-OUT**  
---  
We provide you the opportunity to 'opt-out' of having your personally identifiable information used for certain purposes when we ask for this information. For example, if you purchase a travel product, but do not wish to receive any additional marketing material from us, you can indicate your preference in our order form.

If you no longer wish to receive our newsletter and promotional communications, you may opt-out of receiving them by following the instructions included in each newsletter or communication, or by contacting us at the address below.
