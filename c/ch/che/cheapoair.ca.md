**SECURITY**  
---  
  
The security of your personal information is important to us. When you enter sensitive information (such as credit card number and/or geo-location data) on our registration or order forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). [ To learn more about SSL, follow this link [http://www.verisign.com/ssl/ssl-information-center/how-ssl-security-works/index.html ]](http://www.verisign.com/ssl/ssl-information-center/how-ssl-security-works/index.html) ]

All of our secure servers use a high-grade encryption key (RC4 with 128 bi t secret key). While secure mode provides SSL encryption, pages will take longer to download. Most users choose to sign up or sign in using standard mode to achieve quicker response time.

If you receive browser warnings when going from secure mode pages to non-SSL pages, it is most likely a warning that you are switching servers. As long as your data is entered on a secure mode page, it will only be transmitted to a secure server.

We follow accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. We urge you to take every precaution to protect you personal data when you are on the Internet. Change your passwords often, use a combination of letters and numbers, and make sure you use a secure browser.

To ensure that your credit, debit or charge card is not being used without your consent, we may validate your name, address and contact number supplied by you during the booking process against appropriate third party databases. By accepting these terms and conditions you agree and authorize us to carry out such verification checks as stated herein. In performing these checks, you acknowledge and concur that such personal information you provide to us may be disclosed to a registered Credit Reference Agency which may keep a record of such information in whole or in part. You can rest assured that this verification process is performed for the sole purpose to verify and confirm your identity, and that this process does not perform a credit check, and your credit rating will not be affected whatsoever. All information provided by you to us is securely processed in strict accordance with the Data Protection Act of 1998.
