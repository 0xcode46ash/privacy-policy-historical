### Your Information

Unless we specifically notify you otherwise or you have elected otherwise, any information you provide to **Checkatrade** will only be used within **Checkatrade** and for the delivery of **Checkatrade** â€™s services to you and/or your nominated acquaintances. **Checkatrade** will use the information for administration purposes and for the provision to you of any information and services that you have requested.

We will only keep a record of your information for as long as is necessary for the purposes it was provided: for example, we will only hold your personal information on our systems for as long as you use the service that you have requested. We will ensure that all personal information supplied is held securely.
