| **COLLECTION AND USE OF INFORMATION**  
---  
We request certain personally identifiable information from you on our order form when you make a booking with us. You must provide contact information (such as name, email, and shipping address) and financial information (such as credit card number, expiration date). 

We may collect additional information about you when you register an account with us, including (without limitation) from emails or other correspondence that you send to us, when you participate in competitions, questionnaires and surveys and when you contact us or our customer service representatives. We may also collect information about you from third party sources (for example credit checking agencies) and we may collect information about your usage of the Site (see below under the heading "Cookies").

CheapOair uses this information: 

  * for billing purposes 
    * to fulfill your Booking and its purchasing of travel-related products and services
  * to contact you if we have trouble processing your Booking 
  * to answer your questions and process your requests for services from us
  * to improve your shopping experience and the Site 
  * for internal administration, analysis and quality assurance purposes, including fraud prevention 
  * for marketing assistance 
  * to keep you informed about our latest services

To ensure that your credit, debit or charge card is not being used without your consent, we may validate your name, address and contact number supplied by you during the booking process against appropriate third party databases. By accepting the terms of this Privacy Policy you agree and authorize us to carry out such verification checks as stated herein. In performing these checks, you acknowledge and concur that such personal information you provide to us may be disclosed to a registered Credit Reference Agency which may keep a record of such information in whole or in part. You can rest assured that this verification process is performed for the sole purpose of verifying and confirming your identity and that this process does not perform a credit check, so your credit rating will not be affected by it.

All information provided by you to us is securely processed in strict accordance with the Data Protection Act of 1998. 

**Co-Travelers**

When you register for an account we offer you the opportunity to provide personal information about others who may travel with you such as name, email and date of birth. CheapOair stores this information for the sole purpose allowing you to book travel on behalf of others.

Co-Travelers may contact us at [ cservice@CheapOair.co.uk](mailto:cservice@CheapOair.co.uk) to request that we remove this information from our database.

**Sharing your information**

For the purposes of providing you with services we may provide your personal information to third party service providers, our group companies, our outsource service providers (including companies who process your order on our behalf) and/or selected third party marketing partners. For example, we use an outside shipping company to ship paper tickets, and a credit card processing company to bill you for travel products. These companies do not retain, share, store or use your personal information for any other purposes. 

We may disclose your personal information to third parties, such as official bodies and our professional advisers, as far as we believe necessary (i) to comply with relevant laws, orders or regulations, (ii) to enforce our customer terms and conditions of use or other contractual agreements and (iii) to protect the property and other rights of CheapOair, its group companies, customers and others (for example, in any way relating to protection against fraudulent activities in respect of CheapOair).

We may from time to time restructure our business operations (for example, by selling part of our business) to a buyer either within or outside of our group. In such transactions your personal information could be transferred as part of the relevant sale (including during negotiations for sale). If this is the case we would let you know. 

CheapOair does not sell, trade, share or rent your personal information to others without your prior consent. 

Except with your consent and/or as permitted or required by applicable law, we will only share your personal information as described in this Privacy Policy. 

**Transfer outside the UK**

For any of the above purposes, we may need to send your information internationally including to countries outside the European Economic Area (EEA) for example to Fareportal Inc, one of our group companies in New York, USA. Please note that certain countries (such as the USA) do not have equivalent data protections to those required in the UK and EEA and by visiting the Site, you consent to such transfer of your information outside of the EEA. We will, however, take steps to ensure that your personal information is transferred, stored and processed in accordance with appropriate security standards and in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy and applicable data protection laws.

**Third party websites**

Other websites accessible through the Site have their own privacy policies and data collection practices. Please consult each website's privacy policy. CheapOair is not responsible for the actions or omissions of third parties.  
  
  
**COOKIES**  
---  
Like many other sites, this Site uses cookies to personalise your experience, and to speed up the member sign in process. Cookies are information stored on your computer. Cookies are not used to track your movement or perform any function other than to enhance your use of our Site and are not linked to personal information. If your browser does not support cookies, or you have not enabled cookies in your browser, many of these time-saving features will not work properly. Also, you need to have cookies enabled in your browser if you want to enter the members' area. 

A cookie may be placed by our advertising server. These cookies are used only for the purposes of tracking the effectiveness of advertising served by us on our Site. No personal information about you is gathered by the use of these cookies. Cookies may be placed by our third party advertising companies who may use aggregated statistics about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about travel-related goods and services that you may be interested in. The information collected does not include your personal information. This privacy statement covers the use of cookies by CheapOair only and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers. If you would like to opt out of re-targeted advertising from CheapOair that occurs when visiting our third party advertising publishers, please [click here](http://preferences.truste.com/truste/). Please note this does not opt you out of being served advertising. You will continue to receive generic ads. 

If you register or place an order with us or if you continue to use the Site, you agree to our use of cookies. 

You can set up your computer to reject cookies although, if you do so, you may not be able to use certain features on the Site.  
  
  
**THIRD PARTY TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES**  
---  
  
We use a third party tracking service called Google Analytics that uses tracking technology to track non-personally identifiable information about visitors to our site in the aggregate.  
  
  
**SECURITY**  
---  
The security of your personal information is important to us. When you enter sensitive information (such as your credit card number) on our registration or order forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). To learn more about SSL, follow this link <http://www.verisign.com/ssl/ssl-information-center/how-ssl-security-works/index.html>

All of our secure servers use a high-grade encryption key (RC4 with 128 bit secret key). While secure mode provides SSL encryption, pages will take longer to download. Most users choose to sign up or sign in using standard mode to achieve quicker response time. 

If you receive browser warnings when going from secure mode pages to non-SSL pages, it is most likely a warning that you are switching servers. As long as your data is entered on a secure mode page, it will only be transmitted to a secure server. 

We follow accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security and any transmission is at your own risk. We urge you to take every precaution to protect your personal data when you are on the Internet. Change your passwords often, use a combination of letters and numbers, and make sure you use a secure browser. 

If you have any questions about security on the Site, you can email us at [cservice@CheapOair.co.uk](mailto:cservice@CheapOair.co.uk)  
  
  
**GOVERNMENT AND LEGAL**  
---  
We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our Site.

Under US law, airlines are required to provide the US Department of Homeland Security with certain information about passengers travelling to and from the US. A list of frequently asked questions has been compiled by the Article 29 Data Protection Working Party to provide further information to passengers. Please click [here](http://ec.europa.eu/justice/policies/privacy/index_en.htm) to learn more.  
  
  
**ACCESS TO PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION**  
---  
If your personally identifiable information changes, or if you no longer wish to use our services, you may correct, update, delete or deactivate it by logging into your account and making the appropriate changes, emailing to our Customer Support at [cservice@CheapOair.co.uk](mailto:cservice@CheapOair.co.uk) or by contacting us by telephone or postal mail at the contact information listed below.

We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services. We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.   
  
  
**CHILDREN'S PRIVACY PROTECTION**  
---  
CheapOair understands the importance of protecting children's privacy in the interactive online world. The Site is not designed for, or intentionally targeted at, persons under 18 years of age. For the avoidance of doubt, it is not our policy to intentionally collect or maintain information about anyone under the age of 13.  
  
**OPT-OUT**  
---  
We provide you the opportunity to 'opt-out' of having your personally identifiable information used for certain purposes when we ask for this information. For example, if you purchase a travel service, but do not wish to receive any additional marketing material from us, you can indicate your preference in our order form.

To keep you informed about our latest services, we may notify you via email newsletter of any changes to our offering. If you no longer wish to receive our newsletter and promotional communications, you may opt-out of receiving them by following the instructions included in each newsletter or communication, or by contacting us at the address below.
