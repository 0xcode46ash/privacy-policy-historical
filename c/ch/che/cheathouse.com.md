**OUR PRIVACY POLICY**  


**_Do you store my personal information?_**

Cheathouse.com and its advertisers and affiliates are deeply committed to protecting the privacy of its Internet users.

We will not store any information on our computer systems about a specific user. We do store however, general information which might help us understand the browsing patters of our users. This helps us improve our system and create new services that might become useful to our visitors.

We do however, store specific information about users which choose to register as paying members. Nevertheless, the only information gathered is that needed for users to login and access the services they pay for, and to help up get in touch with them. We never keep credit card information in our database.

**_Do you share visitor information with 3rd parties?_**

The only information Cheathouse.com may share with any 3rd party is general statistical information concerning the browsing patterns and target audience for specific pages of our site. We do NOT give out specific user information such as e-mails, names and addresses. In fact, we consider such information so precious, we are not willing to part with it for any cost.

We may from time to time annouce big changes or improvements on CheatHouse.com via email. We know that some people get very annoyed with this, so it will always be possible opt-out of these info-mails. And no, we don't send mails to people who have nothing to do with our services.

You are our customers, and we value your loyalty - we will never wish you to be bothered by SPAM e-mail or any other kind of unsolicited e-mail potentially caused by sharing such information with a 3rd party.

As big supporters of OpenSource software (and frequent visitors to sites such as [Slashdot.org](http://www.slashdot.org/)) you can easily imagine where we stand on this personally.
