**Automated Information Collection**

_CHEFS Catalog Automated Collection_

We and our service providers use cookies, web beacons, and other technologies to receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with our website through your computer or mobile device. This information, which includes the pages you visit on our site, which web address you came from, the type of browser/device/hardware you are using, purchase information and checkout process, search terms and IP-based geographic location, helps us customize your website experience and make our marketing messages more relevant. This includes content presented on another website or mobile application.. These technologies enable us to provide features such as storage of items in your cart between visits, Short Message Service (SMS)/text messages you have chosen to receive, items previously viewed, to improve site design, product assortments, customer service, and provide promotions.

In order to provide the best guest experience possible, we also use these technologies for reporting and analysis purposes, such as how you are shopping our website, performance of our marketing efforts, and your response to those marketing efforts.

_Third-Party Automated Collection_

CHEFS Catalog participates in online behavioral advertising (OBA), also known as interest-based advertising. We use third-party advertising companies to display ads tailored to your individual interests based on how you browse and shop online.

We allow third-party companies to collect certain information when you visit our website and to use that information to serve ads for products or services or for the products or services of other companies when you visit this website or other websites. These companies use non-personally identifiable information (e.g., click stream information, browser type, time and date, subject of advertisements clicked or scrolled over, hardware/software information, MAC address, cookie and session ID, and personally identifiable information (e.g. IP address)) during your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services likely to be of greater interest to you. These parties typically use a cookie or a third party web beacon to collect this information. 

At this time, we do not respond to browser “do not track” signals, but we do provide you the option to opt out of behavioral advertising. To learn more about OBA or to opt-out of this type of advertising, visit the [Network Advertising Initiative website](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/) and the [Digital Advertising Alliance website](http://www.aboutads.info/).
