A Cookie is a text file that downloads small bits of information to the device you are accessing the page from when you use it. The next time you visit the website using that device the details of your previous visit are remembered. Cookies help us maintain the performance of the website and allow us to remember your preferences and make improvements based on visitor statistics. We also sometimes place cookies on your device which help us serve relevant adverts to you when you visit other websites.

### Types of Cookies we use

The categories of cookies we use on the website and the function they perform is listed below.

**Necessary Cookies  
**These cookies are essential for the website to function properly and cannot be disabled without severely effecting the usability of the website. The law does not require us to ask consent to use these cookies and they will always be placed when you use this website.  They are used for features such as navigation.

Where possible, we delete these cookies when you leave the website. Some cookies last longer; for example some cookies set by our website management system remain on your device for longer.

**Functional Cookies  
**These cookies remember various choices you make on the website to improve your experience. They are also used to display recommendations for you based on your past activity on the site. Functional Cookies control features such as usability preferences and may also be required for actions such as watching a video. 

Any data that these cookies collect is anonymised before being used for any other purpose– we don’t keep records of your data or track you personally, or monitor how you browse on other websites. 

This information is not made available to other websites.

**Analytics Cookies  
**Analytics cookies are used to gather anonymous data on how visitors use the website. They look at what pages are the most popular, how long visitors stay on them, if and where a user gets an error message and other similar data which we use to improve how the website works and make information easier to find.  This data is anonymous and we cannot track you individually using analytics cookies.

**Advertising Cookies  
**We use advertising cookies to help display relevant ads to you on other websites. These cookies are used to help ensure the people our adverts are shown to are likely to have an interest in the types of products we sell. 

Some cookies are used to display products we think you might be very interested in based on what you have already looked at on our site, others are less specific and simply understand you that you like to look at certain types of information online – for example that you are a sports fan or you visit cookery sites.

The cookies also measure how many times you see the ad and its effectiveness so we can stop targeting you if you do not respond to the ad.
