# CheatServer: Privacy Policy

CheatServer respects the privacy rights of its visitors and is committed to protecting all personal information. To further this commitment, we have adopted this Online Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy”) to guide how we collect, store, and use your online information. CheatServer follows established online information collection and use practices. 

## What does this Privacy Policy apply to?

This Privacy Policy currently applies to the following web site(s) operated by CheatServer (collectively referred to as the “CheatServer Web site,” “our Web site,” or “cheatserver.com”): 

[www.cheatserver.com](http://www.cheatserver.com/)

In the future, if we wish to include additional Web sites under this Privacy Policy, we will take reasonable steps to list those Web sites above and ensure that they provide a link to this Privacy Policy. 

Please note that this Privacy Policy applies only to information submitted and collected online through the CheatServer Web site (as listed above), whether maintained by CheatServer or one of our vendors, and does _not_ apply to information that may be collected by CheatServer offline. In addition, this Privacy Policy does not extend to Web sites maintained by other companies or organizations to which we link or which link to us. Because we cannot guarantee that the privacy policies of such sites meet our high standards, we encourage you to read the privacy policy of the Web site to which you link before you submit any personal information to that site. 

_Please note that by using our Web site, you signify your assent to CheatServer’s Online Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to this Privacy Policy, please do not use our Web site. We reserve the right to make changes to this Privacy Policy. Please check back from time to time to ensure that you are aware of these changes. Your continued use of our Web site will signify your acceptance of these changes. Please note that if we make a material change to this Privacy Policy, we will notify you by posting the change on our Web site or in this Privacy Policy and, if necessary, give you additional choices regarding such changes._

## Does CheatServer use cookies, or other passive means to collect information?

Like many Web sites, CheatServer.com sets “cookies” on your computer. Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer’s hard drive through your Web browser, allowing us to determine the time and date of a cookie previously supplied by CheatServer, if applicable. If cookies are not enabled on your Web browser, you will still be able to use the CheatServer Web site. The “help” menu on most Web browsers will tell you how to enable cookies. 

In the course of serving advertisements to this site, our third-party advertiser may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser. 

We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer our Web site. Your IP address is also used to collate traffic statistics for our server. 

## Who is collecting my personal information and is it shared with anyone?

The information that you disclose on the CheatServer Web site is collected by CheatServer or by a vendor on CheatServer’s behalf; and, is used in accordance with the practices set forth above. A breakdown of our data disclosure policies follows. 

### Agents and Contractors

The ads appearing on this Web site are delivered to you by DoubleClick, our Web advertising partner. Information about your visits to this site, such as number of times you have viewed an ad (but not your name, address, or other personal information), is used to serve ads to you.

### Co-Sponsors and Promotional Partners

From time to time, we may run contests, special offers, or other events or activities (“events”) on our Web site. Information collected for these events may include personal information (e.g., name, mailing address, etc.) and may be collected by or shared with a third party sponsor, co-sponsor, or other reputable third party (e.g., promotional partner, retailer, or game or magazine publisher). While we have no control over the third party's use of such information, we will attempt to ensure that they agree to protect the confidentiality, security, and integrity of any personal information we share with them (or that they collect through our Web site). If you do not want your information to be collected by or shared with a third party, you can choose not to participate in these events at the time of the contest/event or when the information is collected. 

In some instances, we may have an arrangement with a promotional partner, whereby they share with us customer information collected on their web site. In the event that we receive such data and combine it with our customer records, the combined information will be treated in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Otherwise, all such information is subject to the privacy policy under which it was collected. 

### Disclosure and/or Transfer of Personal Information

We may disclose any and/or all personal information about you in the good faith belief that we are required to do so by law, including but not limited to requests pursuant to subpoena or court order, and/or disclosure to local, state, or federal law enforcement, or other government officials pursuant to investigations they are conducting.
