Thanks for visiting CheapCaribbean.com! We are concerned about and respect your privacy while visiting our web site. We want you to know CheapCaribbean.com will never sell, lease or rent your confidential information to ensure your privacy is protected. We will always endeavor to take steps to assure that any information you provide to us will remain private and secure. Please take a moment to read over our privacy policy and let us know if you have any questions or comments.

**Collection of Information**  
CheapCaribbean.com will sometimes ask for personal information such as your name, address, e-mail address, occupation, and other details. Providing us your information will simply help us offer products and services that we think you'd like to hear about.

**Personal Information Privacy**  
CheapCaribbean.com will take all appropriate steps to keep your personal information confidential. Those steps include limiting access to your information databases, communicating this policy statement to all CheapCaribbean.com employees and establishing and enforcing penalties for violating this statement.

CheapCaribbean.com will not sell, rent, or give away your personal information to other companies for them to use in selling others' products or services. When we do contract with another company to market or advertise products or services for us, we will insist on binding agreements from those companies protecting your information. We will vigorously enforce all privacy agreements we have with other companies.

We gather personal information so we can better develop our relationship with you. Occasionally, we seek your comments on our products and services. These comments allow us to determine which products and services you should be made aware of based on your specific needs.

**Order Information Privacy**  
CheapCaribbean.com currently uses the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol to safeguard your information, including your credit card number, during online transactions. None of the people, who have made purchases through CheapCaribbean.com's web site using SSL, have reported fraudulent use of their credit card as a result of their online order. We believe SSL to be a very safe encryption method, but we are always looking for even more secure encryption methods to safeguard information sent online. 

**Cookies**  
CheapCaribbean.com currently uses a "cookie" on our site. Our cookies tag each visitor's browser with a random, unique number. The cookie simply assigns a number and does not disclose any personal information about the person using the browser. By noting where these uniquely numbered browsers go on our site, we can study traffic patterns and improve our site to better fit our clients' needs. **Your Consent**  
By using our Web site, you consent to the collection and use of this information by CheapCaribbean.com. If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on this page so that you are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances we disclose it.

**Changes**  
CheapCaribbean.com reserves the right to make changes to this privacy policy at any time and requests that you review this policy for updates.

**Questions or Suggestions**  
Please direct all questions or comments regarding this privacy policy to CheapCaribbean.com, Inc, 2003 South Easton Road Suite 100 Doylestown, PA 18901.
