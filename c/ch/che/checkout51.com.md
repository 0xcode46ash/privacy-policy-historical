# Checkout 51 - Privacy Policy

**Last updated on October 1, 2012**

Welcome to the Checkout 51 privacy policy. First of all, we'd like to say how seriously we take your privacy. Checkout 51 works when you upload photos of your grocery receipts and we understand that what appears on your receipt can sometimes be sensitive. Because of this, we want to make sure you are absolutely comfortable with what information is collected when you participate in Checkout 51, and how this information is used. 

This Privacy Policy applies to Checkout 51, our mobile applications, and our website located at [www.checkout51.com](http://www.checkout51.com/) (collectively, the "Service(s)"). This Privacy Policy covers Checkout 51's treatment of your personally identifiable information ("Personal Data") and other data that we gather when you use our Service. By using Checkout 51, you are consenting to our use of it in accordance with this Privacy Policy. 

If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy or our use of your personally identifiable information, please submit a [support request](http://support.checkout51.com/anonymous_requests/new) or contact us: 

Checkout 51 Inc.  
411 Richmond Street East, Suite 301  
Toronto, ON, M5A 3S5, Canada  


## What personal data does Checkout 51 collect?

We collect Personal Data from you when you voluntarily provide such information. This includes when you register for Checkout 51 (for example, name, location and email address), use certain Services, upload receipts, or connect your Checkout 51 account to online third party services such as Facebook, Twitter or other social networks (see your settings in those services to control how much information they share). Also, we have designed the Services so that wherever reasonably possible, when we collect Personal Data we provide a link to this Privacy Policy. 

Our mobile application allows you to configure it to track your location and provide you with offers from the applicable merchant when you are at their location. You can turn this feature off by adjusting your phone settings. Also, we collect data from each user's usage of the mobile application to help us analyze the performance and usage of the Services. However, the location information and data described in this paragraph is collected on an anonymous basis - it is not associated with your identity. 

## What receipt data does Checkout 51 collect?

When you upload receipts to Checkout 51, we collect information contained on the receipts such as the name and location of the store, information about the products and brands you purchased, your rewards card information (if applicable), coupons used, the total amount you spend, the prices you paid, and the date of your purchase (collectively, "Receipt Data"). We use this information to verify the cash back you should receive, for fraud prevention and, in aggregate form, for the purposes described in the section entitled "How does Checkout 51 use aggregate data?" We will also use your Receipt Data to enable our mobile application to provide you with customized Offers from our partners; however these partners never receive your name, mailing address or email address. 

## How does Checkout 51 use aggregate data?

In order to provide the best service to you, Checkout 51 measures and analyzes the demographics, interests and behavior of our users based on the Personal Data and Receipt Data provided to us. Sometimes we may provide aggregate information to our partners about how our users, collectively, use our service. Checkout 51 may also share aggregated user statistics in order to describe our services to current and prospective business partners, and to other third parties. This aggregated data does not identify you. 

## What about cookies?

A cookie is a piece of information that Checkout 51, and most other companies with websites, gives to your browser when you access our website. We use this cookie to help understand how you are using our service and to provide you with additional functionality. If you are concerned about the use of cookies you can easily disable them by accessing the "help" section of your favorite browser. We recommend that you leave cookies turned on so you can take advantage of all of the features of Checkout 51. 

## How does Checkout 51 use my Personal Data and other information?

Our use of any Personal Data you provide us is dictated by this Privacy Policy. 

Checkout 51 uses any Personal Data you supply to deliver the service you expected when you gave us the Personal Data. For example, when you upload a receipt, we use the data contained on it to verify that you purchased the products on offer and to calculate the amount of cash back that we should credit to your account. Also, when you request payment and provide your address, we use this information to send you payment. And when you provide your name and email address when you log in, we use this information to identify your account so you can use our service. 

We may also use your Personal Data to help us improve Checkout 51 and to contact you regarding the Services. As a user of Checkout 51, you cannot opt out of some communications that we feel are essential to using the Service, for example, service notifications. We may use your email address to email you about products and services that our partners offer, but if we do that, the email will contain an opt-out link that will allow you to opt-out of any further messages of this nature from us. 

If at any time Checkout 51 needs to use your Personal Data in any manner that is not consistent with this Privacy Policy, we will notify you prior to or at the time the Personal Data is collected. 

## When does Checkout 51 need to share my Personal data or other information?

Checkout 51 considers your Personal Data an essential part of our relationship with you and a key component in delivering you a great service. We do not sell this information or provide it to third parties except as described in this Privacy Policy. There are times though when we need to share this data with certain third parties in order to operate our business. These circumstances are described below: 

  1. Business transactions and related companies â€“ As we operate Checkout 51 we may buy or sell business assets or the company, merge with other companies, reorganize or dissolve. Personal Data may be part of the transferred assets during any of these events. Consistent with this Privacy Policy, we may also share your Personal Data with our affiliates. 
  2. Agents and Service Providers - Like many businesses, Checkout 51 sometimes needs to work with agents, third party suppliers and other service providers. For example, we might work with a cheque sending company or payment processing company. In the course of these relationships we sometimes need to share your Personal Data and other information with these companies so they can perform their specific services. 
  3. Anonymized Aggregated Data - As described above, we aggregate and anonymize data and use and disclose such information for a variety of purposes. However, in these situations, we do not disclose any information that could be used to identify you personally. 
  4. Law and Harm; Jurisdictions - We may preserve or disclose your information if we believe that it is reasonably necessary to comply with a law, regulation or legal request; to protect the safety of any person; to address fraud, security or technical issues or a breach of our Terms of Use; or to protect our or any other person's rights or property. However, nothing in this Privacy Policy is intended to limit any legal defenses or objections that you may have to a third party's, including a government's, request to disclose your information. Finally, please note that in some cases, personal information that we collect may be stored or processed outside of Canada. In such cases, we continue to protect the information with appropriate safeguards, but it may be subject to the legal jurisdiction of those countries and governmental authorities in those countries. 



## What is not included in this Privacy Policy?

This includes, but is not limited to, information posted to any public areas of the Service and any unsolicited submissions.

## Is my Personal Data secure?
