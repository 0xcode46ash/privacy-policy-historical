# Chevron Cars: Privacy Policy

Welcome to the Chevron Cars website!! We are about to tell you some very important information, so please ask your mom or dad to come and read along with you. We are very concerned about protecting the privacy of children under 13. So, we think that it's important for you and your parents to understand and feel comfortable with how we collect information from you and how we use that information. 

The Chevron Cars website is designed for kids of all ages to play games, have fun, and learn new things. We have packed our site with lots of different games, activities, and an online store called the KIDS SHOP. We hope that you'll look around the KIDS SHOP at all of the cool things, but you can't buy anything in the KIDS SHOP unless you are 18 years or older. If you are under 18 and you want to buy something, you'll have to ask your parents to buy it for you. 

We are not allowed to require you to tell us more about yourself than is reasonably necessary to play games or participate in activities on our site. So, for most activities, we don't ask you for any identifying information. For some activities, we ask for your email address and your parent's email address. We only ask for your email address when you ask US to send YOU email, such as a newsletter or an answer to your question. And, we ask for your parent's email address so that we can tell your mom or dad that you have asked us to send you email. We don't share any information collected on this site with anybody. And, as you'll see, there are no advertisers on this site. 

That's Wally the Warning Squirrel. He will appear to warn you that either (1) you are being asked to give us personally identifying information, or (2) you are entering the KIDS SHOP where you must be 18 or older and have a valid credit card to make a purchase. **Privacy Policy Table Of Contents:**

How to contact us  


**WHAT INFORMATION WE COLLECT AND WHY WE COLLECT IT:**  


(1) **Information for Registration.** To participate and play games in MY GARAGE, ROAD RALLY or FOOD FOR THOUGHT we ask you to register. To register, we ask you for three pieces of information about you and a Screen Name and Password that you get to choose. NONE of this information, by itself or in combination, is enough to tell us who you are or how to contact you, except through your parent's email. 

**_YOUR BIRTHDAY._** We use your birthday to see how many people in your age group are using the site, and we use that information to improve the site. 

**_YOUR ZIP CODE._** Your zip code helps us see where people who are using our site live. It helps us decide if we should include information on the site that might be interesting to you because of the area where you live. Also, it helps us to schedule maintenance at the best times, so that the site is almost always up and running when you come. 

**_YOUR PARENT'S EMAIL._** If you are under 13, we ask you for your parent's email address. We use your parent's email address only as a means to notify your mom or dad that you have registered on our site. Once we send your mom or dad an email, we delete your parent's email address. 

**_A SCREEN NAME AND PASSWORD YOU CHOOSE._** The Screen Name and Password you choose should be a favorite hobby, a favorite animal, your favorite food, or any other neat word. We specifically ask you NOT to use your real name for your Screen Name or your Password to protect your privacy. 

(2) **The Kids Shop.** Everyone is allowed to browse the KIDS SHOP and look at all the cool things for sale. BUT you MUST BE 18 OR OLDER and have a valid credit card to make a purchase. If you want to, you can make a "Wish List" of the cool things you like in the KIDS SHOP and send it in an email to your friends and family!! If you decide you want to make a "Wish List," you first will have to create a profile in the KIDS SHOP. Even if you have already registered to play games on the site, you will have to create a profile in the KIDS SHOP. 

To create a profile in the KIDS SHOP, we ask for a User Name, a Password, and your birth date. Your User Name and Password will have to be different from the Screen Name and Password you choose to register to play games on the site. NONE of this information, by itself or in combination, is enough to tell us who you are or how to contact you. After you have created a profile in the KIDS SHOP, you can create and save a "Wish List." Just click on the "Add to Wish List" button on any of the pages that feature a car or product and that item will be added to your "Wish List." If you want to save it, just make sure you are logged in at the KIDS SHOP. Then you can view it and edit it whenever you come back to the KIDS SHOP. To view it, simply click on the Wish List icon at the top right hand of any page in the KIDS SHOP. You can email your "Wish List" to friends and family. When you send your "Wish List", we don't find out either your email address or your friend's email address because the "Wish List" is sent from YOUR computer and email, NOT from our website. 

(3) **Newsletters.** If you decide that you want to, you can go to the [NEWSLETTER CLUB](https://web.archive.org/sendme_app/index.html) and ask to receive a subscription to one of our newsletters via email. In the [NEWSLETTER CLUB](https://web.archive.org/sendme_app/index.html), we ask you to tell us how old you are. After you submit your age, a new page appears where you fill in (1) which newsletters you would like to receive, (2) your email address, and (3) your parent's email address. We keep your parent's email address so that your parent can review, change, delete or block your email address from our newsletter mailing list at any time. We keep your email address only so that we can send you newsletters and only for as long as you want us to keep sending them to you. If or when you decide that you don't want to receive a newsletter anymore, just reply to any newsletter, put "unsubscribe" in the subject line and we will stop sending it to you and delete your email address from our mailing list. 

We have three newsletters: THE TRIBUNE, THE TREEHOUSE, and TOY CAR NEWS. THE TRIBUNE is a weekly newsletter about fun things to do, interesting historical events, and little known facts. THE TREEHOUSE is a newsletter about new things to do in the Treehouse. TOY CAR NEWS is a note about what new toy cars are being planned and when they will be available in local Chevron stations. Remember, we don't send a newsletter to you automatically -- you have to tell us that you want to receive it. 

(4) **Sending a Card or Games to Your Friends.** In MY GARAGE, we included cards that you can send to your friends. You can personalize your card on our site, and then you can send it as a link through your email to your friends. When you're on the PLAYGROUND, you can send games that you like to your friends the same way you can send cards. The game will be a link in an email that you send. When you send a card or a game, we don't find out either your email address or your friend's email address because you send cards or games from YOUR computer and email, NOT from our website. 

(5) **Questions and Feedback.** As you look at our site, you might decide to use our feedback page to give us advice about what you think we are doing well, or what you think we can do to make this website even better. If you want to give us feedback, you may do so without telling us anything about yourself. But, if you ask a question and would like us to respond, you will need to give us your email address. We will use your email address ONLY to respond to the question or feedback that you sent to us, and then we will throw your email address away. 

(6) **Cookies and Other Electronic Footprints.** Cookies are pieces of information that a website transfers to your hard drive for record-keeping purposes. Cookies let us know if you come back to Chevron Cars, so that we can say, "Hello, again." They help us keep track of your High Score on the games you play, and they allow us to name Your Garage just for you!!! You can set your browser to refuse cookies if you want to, but it might interfere with some of your activities on the site. 

When you are surfing the different pages on our website, your electronic footprints allow our computer to identify your computer using its IP address. Using the IP address, our computer gathers certain information such as which pages you visited and how long you stayed. But NONE of this information gives us access to your name, where you live, your email or other personally identifiable information. We use this anonymous information to help us figure out what you like most about our site so that we can keep improving it for everyone to enjoy!!

We will then delete all of your information EXCEPT your parent's email address, which we will keep. If your mom or dad has blocked your subscriptions and you try to re-subscribe, when you enter your parent's email address, we will block our collection of any information from you. We will then send your mom or dad an email telling them that you have been back to our site. If your mom or dad decides it's okay for you to subscribe again, they can send an email to [webmaster@chevroncars.com](mailto:webmaster@chevroncars.com) to tell us to let you subscribe again. Finally, if we ever find that we have collected information by mistake that is information that under this Privacy Policy we said we wouldn't be collecting, we will delete that information from our records immediately. 

**KIDS SHOP:** If you created a profile in the KIDS SHOP and you want to change or delete your User Name or Password, you may do so in the "My Profile" area. The link appears on the upper right hand corner of any page in the KIDS SHOP. When you select the option to update your information, the form that you filled out when you created your profile will appear. You may then make whatever changes you would like. When you are finished, press the "Update" button to save your changes.

**LINKS TO OTHER SITES**  


We provide links to other websites on some sections of our site because we think they provide activities and offers that you might enjoy. To help you tell whether you are on our site or another company's site, we display warnings to let you know you are leaving our site and entering another. Once you enter the other site, if you use any of their services or provide them with any information, THEIR rules and policies apply, not ours. 

You should be careful not to provide any personal information, such as your name, address, or email address to other websites unless the privacy policy specifies a way for your parents to give permission, and your parents do give you permission to participate on the site.

### **Privacy Policy for Everyone Over 13 Years Old  
(Please see above for Privacy Policy for Kids Under 13))**

Welcome to the Chevron Cars website!! Because we respect your privacy, we want to disclose to you how we use the information that you provide to us online. Most of our site is intended for children's use, and in our Privacy Policy for Kids, we tell kids and their parents about our collection and use of information from children under 13. 

The Chevron Cars website is designed for kids of all ages to play games, have fun, and learn new things. We have designed our site to include games, activities and an online store called the KIDS SHOP. The KIDS SHOP contains items we know are attractive to children, but we do not allow anyone under 18 years old to make a purchase in the store. Of course, we encourage people of all ages to look at our cool merchandise. However, we make it very clear to all users that you must be 18 or older to make a purchase in our KIDS SHOP. In fact, you can't make a purchase in the KIDS SHOP without a valid credit card. That means that anybody under 18 wanting to make a purchase must ask their parents to do it for them.

**WHAT INFORMATION WE COLLECT AND HOW WE USE THAT INFORMATION**

(1) **Cookies and Other Electronic Footprints.** Cookies are pieces of information that a website transfers to your hard drive for record-keeping purposes. The cookies used on this site are used for games and activities, so that we can keep track of scores and welcome users back to play more games. If you set your browser to decline cookies, you may find that some parts of the site will not function properly. 

When you are surfing the different pages on our website, your electronic footprints allow our computer to identify your computer using its IP address. Using your IP address, our computer gathers certain information such as which pages you visited and how long you stayed. But, the information that we obtain from your IP address does not allow us to access to any of your identifying information. We use this anonymous information to help us determine which areas of our site people are visiting most so that we can make appropriate improvements to the site. 

(2) **The Kids Shop.** When you enter the KIDS SHOP, we ask you to create a profile using a User Name, a Password, and your birth date. This profile is different from the registration required to participate in games on the site, so you will need to select a new User Name and Password. If you are between the ages of 13 and 17, we ask you in the KIDS SHOP whether you are interested in receiving emails from the KIDS SHOP to inform you of new offerings and promotions. If you would like to receive this email, then select yes to the question "From time to time, Chevron Cars would like to send you email messages on new products or promotions. Would you like to receive this email?" and type in your email address in the space provided. All email sent to users between the ages of 13 to 17 will contain a reminder that you must be 18 or older to make a purchase in the KIDS SHOP. If you are under 18, you must ask your parents to make the purchase for you. 

If you are over the age of 18, we also ask you whether you are interested in receiving email from the KIDS SHOP with information about new offerings and promotions. If you want to receive this email, then select yes to the question "From time to time, Chevron Cars would like to send you email messages on new products or promotions. Would you like to receive this email?" 

We collect additional personal information from you in the KIDS SHOP when you make a purchase. We ask for your name, address, credit card number, telephone, your email address, and your date of birth. We need all of this information to sell you the item and to ship it to where you live. If you input this additional personal information and your credit card number is invalid, we will store everything EXCEPT the invalid credit card number. We do not disclose any of the information that you provide to us in the KIDS SHOP to anybody else. 

If you want, after you create a profile in the KIDS SHOP, you can make a "Wish List" of the things you like in the KIDS SHOP and email it to your friends and family. When you send your "Wish List" to your friends, we do not find out your email address or your friend's email address because the "Wish List" is sent using your personal email account, not our website. 

There are no advertisers on our site collecting information about you, and we do not sell our customer lists to anybody. If this policy changes, you will be notified on this site, and you will have the option to request that we not disclose your information. 

(3) **Games, Newsletters, and Activities.** We do not request any personally identifying information to play any of the games and activities on the Chevron Cars site (excluding the Newsletters and Feedback). To register to play some of the games, we ask for your birthday, your zip code, and a Screen Name and password that you make up. None of that information can be used to identify you. We do ask for your email address if you request that we send you a newsletter or an email. We only keep your email address for as long as we are sending you a newsletter. And, if we send you an answer to your feedback or a question, we will delete your email address immediately after we respond. We do not share your email address or any of the other information we collect with third parties. Should this policy change, we will post a notice on our site and provide you with the option to keep your information private.
