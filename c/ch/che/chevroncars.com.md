### Privacy Policy for Kids Under 13 and Their Parents

_(Please see below forPrivacy Policy for Everyone Over 13)_

Welcome to the Chevron Cars website!! We are about to tell you some very important information, so please ask your mom or dad to come and read along with you. We are very concerned about protecting the privacy of children under 13. So, we think that it's important for you and your parents to understand and feel comfortable with how we collect information from you and how we use that information. 

The Chevron Cars website is designed for kids of all ages to play games, have fun, and learn new things. We have packed our site with lots of different games, activities, and an online store called the KIDS SHOP. We hope that you'll look around the KIDS SHOP at all of the cool things, but you can't buy anything in the KIDS SHOP unless you are 18 years or older. If you are under 18 and you want to buy something, you'll have to ask your parents to buy it for you. 

We are not allowed to require you to tell us more about yourself than is reasonably necessary to play games or participate in activities on our site. So, for most activities, we don't ask you for any identifying information. For some activities, we ask for your email address and your parent's email address. We only ask for your email address when you ask US to send YOU email, such as a newsletter or an answer to your question. We also ask for your email when you send an electronic postcard or use the "email this page" button to a friend, but we delete this email immediately after the email is sent and do not store it. And, we ask for your parent's email address so that we can tell your mom or dad that you have asked us to send you email. We don't share any information collected on this site with anybody. And, as you'll see, there are no advertisers on this site. 

  
See this cute squirrel? 

That's Wally the Warning Squirrel. He will appear to warn you that either (1) you are being asked to give us personally identifying information, (2) you are entering an area of the site that contains commercial and/or product information, or (3) you are entering the KIDS SHOP where you must be 18 or older and have a valid credit card to make a purchase.

##### WHAT INFORMATION WE COLLECT AND WHY WE COLLECT IT:

Here is the scoop on HOW and WHEN we ask for information, WHAT information we collect and WHY we collect it: 

**(1)Information for Registration.** To save your personal game scores in the PLAYGROUND or to make a wish list in the KIDS SHOP we ask you to register. To register, we ask you for two pieces of information about you: your birthday and parent's email address. We also ask you for a Screen Name and Password that you get to choose. NONE of this information, by itself or in combination, is enough to tell us who you are or how to contact you, except through your parent's email address. 

**_YOUR BIRTHDAY._** We use your birthday to see how many people in your age group are using the site, and we use that information to improve the site. 

**_YOUR PARENT'S EMAIL._** If you are under 13, we ask you for your parent's email address. We use your parent's email address only as a means to notify your mom or dad that you have registered on our site. 

**_A SCREEN NAME AND PASSWORD YOU CHOOSE._** The Screen Name and Password you choose should be a favorite hobby, a favorite animal, your favorite food, or any other neat word. To better protect your privacy, we specifically ask you NOT to use your real name for your Screen Name or your Password. You should be careful in maintaining the confidentiality and security of your User Name and Password. Notwithstanding our security measures, the nature of the Internet and each user's computer and/or other access device all permit the possibility that your data and your computer and/or other access device are potentially accessible by third parties, such as computer hackers. 

**(2) The Kids Shop.** Everyone is allowed to browse the KIDS SHOP and look at all the cool things for sale. BUT you MUST BE 18 OR OLDER and have a valid credit card to make a purchase. If you want to, you can make a "Wish List" of the cool things you like in the KIDS SHOP and send it in an email to your friends and family!! If you want to make and save a "Wish List" in the KIDS SHOP, you first will have to make sure that you have logged in with your Screen Name and Password. Once you are logged in, just click on the "Add to Wish List" button on any of the pages that feature a car or product and that item will be added to your "Wish List." You can view and edit your "Wish List" whenever you come back to the KIDS SHOP. To view it, simply make sure you are logged in and click on the Wish List icon at the top right hand of any page in the KIDS SHOP. Your Wish List will appear and you will be able to view and delete any of the items on your Wish List. If you want to, you can email your "Wish List" to friends and family. When you send your "Wish List", we don't save either your email address or your friend's email address. The "Wish List" is sent from YOUR email address, NOT from our webs
