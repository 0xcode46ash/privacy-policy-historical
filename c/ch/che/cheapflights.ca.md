# Privacy Policy

Cheapflights.ca, which is operated by Cheapflights (USA) Inc has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate its commitment to privacy. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for Cheapflights.ca as well as email newsletters. It is important for you to understand what information we collect about you during your visit and what we do with that information.

This Privacy Policy only applies to information collected on Cheapflights.ca and not to information that is collected by Cheapflights through any other means. Your visit to Cheapflights.ca is subject to this Privacy Policy and our [Terms of Use](http://www.cheapflights.com/misc/terms-and-conditions.html).

 **1\. Personal Information Collection and Use**

We do not collect personally identifiable information about you, except when you provide it to us. For example, if you submit a question to us, sign up for our weekly newsletters or a sweepstake on Cheapflights.ca, you may be asked to provide certain information such as your contact information (name, email address, mailing address, etc.).

When you submit your personally identifiable information through Cheapflights.ca, you are giving your consent to the collection, use and disclosure of your personal information as set forth in this Privacy Policy. If you would prefer that we not collect any personally identifiable information from you, please do not provide us with any such information. We will not sell or rent your personally identifiable information to third parties without your consent, except as otherwise disclosed in this Privacy Policy.

Except as otherwise disclosed in this Privacy Policy, we will use the information you provide us only for the purpose of responding to your inquiry or in connection with the service for which you provided such information. For example, if you opt-in to our email alert, we may use your email address to send you periodic emails. We may forward your contact information and inquiry to our affiliates and other divisions of our company that we feel can best address your inquiry or provide you with the requested service. We may also use the information you provide in aggregate form for internal business purposes, such as generating statistics and developing marketing plans. We may share or transfer such non-personally identifiable information with or to our affiliates, licensees, agents and partners.

We may retain other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include, without limitation, customer support and fulfillment companies (e.g., companies that coordinate mailings). Such third parties may be provided with access to personally identifiable information needed to perform their functions, but may not use such information for any other purpose.

In addition, we may disclose any information, including personally identifiable information, we deem necessary, in our sole discretion, to comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal proceeding or governmental request.

 **2\. Email addresses**

Cheapflights USA (Inc) will publish regular email newsletters. Users can sign up for newsletters by providing their email address. This information will not be shared with third parties. Information on how to unsubscribe is also included in every newsletter. We would not provide your email address to a third party unless you asked us to. For example, sweepstakes entries may require you to provide an email address, because in such cases you will often have the option to receive information directly from the prize provider.

 **3\. Log Files**

Cheapflights USA (Inc) records details of individual accesses to its web pages. This information may include details of Internet IP addresses and browser types. We use this information to provide a more relevant site for you. In addition, we use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our Web site. Access by third parties to full log files may be allowed under controlled circumstances for the purposes of auditing. Abstracted log information not showing individual's actual Internet addresses is provided to third parties.

These sites may collect personally identifiable information from you, such as your name, address, credit card details or details pertaining to other methods of payment. These sites may have their own privacy policies which will govern how such sites use and share your personally identifiable information. In addition, Cheapflights.ca displays third party booking tools.

 **7\. Business Transfers**

In such transactions, user information, including personally identifiable information, generally is one of the transferred business assets, and by submitting your personal information on Cheapflights.ca you agree that your data may be transferred to such parties in these circumstances.

 **8\. Notification of Changes**

We may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we decide to change our Privacy Policy, we will post the revised policy here.
