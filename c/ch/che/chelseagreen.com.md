## Security

Information that we collect is stored on secure servers using standard security procedures and practices appropriate to the nature of the information in an effort to protect information from unauthorized access, destruction, use, modification, or disclosure.

We have taken every reasonable precaution to store the data that is collected in a secure manner. We use secure socket layer (SSL) to encrypt your data during transmission to us, but no data transmissions over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Consequently, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission, we make reasonable efforts to ensure security on our end to protect your information from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. However, please note that this is not a guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered or destroyed by breach of such firewalls and other server security measures.

During an online order, it is necessary for Chelsea Green Publishing to send your name, address, telephone number, and credit information to Authorize.net for payment processing. This transaction is conducted securely and in accordance with Authorize.net's specified procedures. The information we send to Authorize.net is protected by Authorize.net's own privacy policy. Under no circumstances, will Authorize.net share your information with any third-party. Please review their policy here: <http://www.authorize.net/company/privacy/>

We use Bronto to send out our various newsletters.

## Automatic Data Collection

When a visitor requests a page of information from a Web site, information about the request is automatically stored in a log file. This information includes the Internet address of the computer making the request, the time and date of the request, the type of Web browser being used, and sometimes, the page from which the visitor is coming. The information does not contain the visitor's name or e-mail address since the visitor's browser does not provide this information to the Web server.

Chelsea Green Publishing analyzes these log files to learn about how visitors are using the content of the site. This information is used to allocate resources effectively and improve the content of our site.

## Voluntary Registration

Certain sections of Chelsea Green Publishing require that visitors register by providing an e-mail address that is recorded in databases on our server. We consider the following, among other things, to be personally identifiable information: first and last name, e-mail address, street address and phone number.

Volunteered information is kept strictly confidential. Chelsea Green Publishing does not share or sell personally identifiable information to other companies. However, information that is voluntarily provided may be used internally. Additionally, Chelsea Green Publishing may choose, on occasion, to include third-party offers in our mailings. We maintain appropriate and reasonable safeguards to ensure the integrity, security, and privacy of the information in our possession.

You may opt not to be included in the e-mail announcements or mailings when you register for one of our offerings. If a particular registration form does not have this option, or, if you'd like to be removed from our lists for any reason, notify Chelsea Green directly by e-mailing [web@chelseagreen.com](mailto:web@chelseagreen.com). Please include your name, e-mail address so that we can effectively remove you from the database.
