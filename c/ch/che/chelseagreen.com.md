# Chelsea Green Privacy Policy

Chelsea Green's No-Nonsense  
**Online Privacy Policy**

**We promise that all personal information provided by you will be held in strictest confidence.**

When you visit our website, or anyone else's, some information is collected. When you fill out a web form, obviously, more information is collected.

When we ask you for information and opinion, we will tell you what we mean to use it for. We will never distribute Personal Information that you provide. We do, from time to time, publish summaries of opinion and demographic information, but never provide specific addresses or email addresses of our sources unless they specifically request that we do so. If you share an opinion that surprises us or seems particularly apt, we may publish it, and attribute it to you, using your name and hometown.

If you prefer that we not use your name, or not quote you, please so inform us in the comment space provided on all our forms.

**Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies**

Our shopping cart system and, in future, some of our other pages, utilize "cookies" and, as explained below, other tracking technologies are in effect on all our pages. A "cookie" is a small text file stored by your browser on your computer. "Cookie Technology" is carefully designed so that it cannot be destructive or invasive. Typically, cookies are used to collect information about Web site activity, your preferences, and other bits of information that make it easier to use the web. For example, our shopping cart system keeps track of your shipping and billing address, so that when you return, it appears that we "know" you. This information is not available to others. Most browsers allow you to control cookies, including whether or not to accept them and how to remove them. While you may set most browsers to notify you if you receive a cookie, or so cookies offered to your browser are not saved, you should know that disabling cookies will make it impossible for you to use our shopping cart system.

Our Internet Service Provider records Internet domain and host names, Internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser software and operating system types, clickstream patterns, and dates and times that our site is accessed. This information is proprietary, and available only to us and to them. We use this information to improve our Web site and your Web experience.

Before enunciating and posting this privacy policy, we diligently reviewed many such policies, and found that most of them are, to be charitable, inadequate. We found [**Sun Microsystem's policy**](http://www.sun.com/privacy/) to be fair and informative, and have based the fine print of our policy on their concepts. Following their lead, we are determined to follow the following principles:

**Notice**

Where Chelsea Green collects Personal Information on the web, we intend to post a purpose statement that explains why Personal Information will be collected. Chelsea Green does not intend to transfer Personal Information to any third parties whatsoever unless such transfer is legally required.

**Choice**

You may choose whether or not to provide Personal Information to Chelsea Green. The notice we intend to provide whenever Chelsea Green collects Personal Information on the Web should help you to make this choice. If you choose not to provide the Personal Information we request, you can still visit most of Chelsea Green's Web sites, but you may be unable to access certain options, offers, and services that involve our interaction with you.

**Security**

Wherever your Personal Information may be held within Chelsea Green, we intend to take reasonable and appropriate steps to protect this confidential information from unauthorized access or disclosure.

**Children's Privacy**

Our website is not structured to attract children. Accordingly, we do not intend to collect Personal Information from anyone we know to be under 13 years of age.

**Commitment**

We are committed to privacy and are actively involved in and support current industry initiatives to preserve individual privacy rights on the Internet. Protecting your privacy online is an evolving area, and Chelsea Green's website is constantly evolving to meet these demands.

If you have any comments or questions regarding our Online Privacy Policy, please contact us at privacy@chelseagreen.com. While we cannot guarantee privacy perfection, we will address any issue to the best of our abilities as soon as possible.

**Your Consent**

By using this Web site, you consent to the terms of our Online Privacy Policy and to Chelsea Green's processing of Personal Information for the purposes given above as well as those explained where Chelsea Green collects Personal Information on the Web. Should the Online Privacy Policy change, we intend to take every reasonable step to ensure that these changes are brought to your attention by posting all changes prominently on our web site for a reasonable period of time.
