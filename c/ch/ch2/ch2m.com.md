 **Use and Disclosure**

When you provide CH2M with personal information about yourself, CH2M will act in a responsible manner, and will only use the information for the purpose for which it was collected. CH2M may provide your information to subsidiaries, affiliates, third party contractors and vendors, purely for the purposes of processing such data on behalf of CH2M to provide the services requested. CH2M will only provide your information to third parties for other purposes when you, the user, specifically requests information from that third party. If a third party service provider providing services on CH2M’s behalf processes personal information in a manner inconsistent with the Privacy Shield Principles, CH2M is potentially liable.

CH2M may store, use, and disclose personal information as authorized or required by applicable law, including making disclosures that are necessary or advisable to: (1) protect the rights, health, safety, or property of CH2M or others; (2) allow for lawful national security related or law enforcement investigations; and (3) comply with applicable laws, regulations, or other lawful requirements.

Except as stated above, CH2M will not transfer, exchange, license, sell, lease, or otherwise disclose your personal information without your approval; however, CH2M may collect and/or provide aggregated and anonymized statistics about the Website, Website Visitors and Business Contacts to other parties.

By using this Website you consent to the transfer of your information and the processing of such information in the United States and other countries where CH2M and its third party vendors operate. You acknowledge that laws on the processing and transfer of personal information in these third countries may be less protective than the privacy laws in the country where you are based.

 **Children’s Privacy**

 **Independent Dispute Resolution for EU Complaints**

To ensure compliance with the Privacy Shield Principles, CH2M provides multiple recourse options for EU citizens as follows:

 _Contact CH2M_

Should you have a complaint, CH2M encourages you to contact us. Based upon the nature of the inquiry, CH2M’s Data Privacy Officer may also be engaged to review and assist as appropriate. CH2M will respond within 45 days of receipt of the complaint.

 _Independent Recourse Mechanism_

If your complaint is not resolved after contacting CH2M, you may seek independent recourse to investigate and resolve the dispute by submitting the complaint to the appropriate Data Protection Authority (DPA) of the EU Member State where CH2M has operations and you reside. The list of DPAs and contact information may be found at:

<http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/article-29/structure/data-protection-authorities/index_en.htm>

CH2M agrees to cooperate with the DPAs in the investigation and resolution of complaints, and comply with the information and advice given by the DPAs. This independent recourse is provided at no cost to you.

 _Binding Arbitration_

If your complaint remains unresolved following the independent recourse process, you may invoke binding arbitration by delivering notice to CH2M. Details of the binding arbitration process may be found at:

<https://www.privacyshield.gov/article?id=ANNEX-I-introduction>

The scope of the arbitration will be limited to the issue of whether CH2M has violated its obligations under the Privacy Shield Principles in relation to your personal information, and whether any such violation remains fully or partially unremedied. The arbitration panel has the authority to impose individual-specific, non-monetary equitable relief (such as access, correction, deletion, or return of your data in question) necessary to remedy the violation of the Privacy Shield Principles only with respect to your claim. No damages, costs, fees, or other remedies are available. Each party bears its own attorney’s fees.

CH2M is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission.

This Policy applies to CH2M HILL Companies, Ltd., and its subsidiaries CH2M HILL Constructors, Inc., CH2M HILL Engineers, Inc., CH2M HILL Global, Inc., CH2M HILL International, Ltd., and CH2M HILL, Inc.
