When you provide CH2M with personal information about yourself, CH2M will act in a responsible manner, and will only use the information for the purpose for which it was collected.  CH2M may provide your information to third party sub-contractors and vendors, purely for the purposes of processing such data on behalf of CH2M.  CH2M will only provide your information to third parties for other purposes when you, the user, specifically requests information from that third party.

CH2M may store, use, and disclose personal information as authorized or required by applicable law, including making disclosures that are necessary or advisable to: (1) protect the rights, health, safety, or property of CH2M or others; (2) allow for lawful security related or law enforcement investigations; and (3) comply with applicable laws, regulations, or other lawful requirements.
