**POLICY APPLIES TO THE COMPANY'S WEBSITES**  
This Privacy Policy applies to this Website, which is controlled by the Christopher & Banks family of companies, including Christopher & Banks Corporation and all our current and future subsidiaries, affiliates, successors and assigns and is operated with the assistance of certain third parties (collectively referred to as "we," "us," the "Company," "Trusted Company" or similar terms). This Privacy Policy does not apply to any other websites, and we make no representations as to the privacy practices of other websites. Also, this Privacy Policy does not apply to information we collect through methods other than through this Website.

**WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT AND STORE?**  
In order to process and track orders, improve your overall experience with us, provide you with information about special offers, maintain our Website, operate our business, and respond to requests, we collect and may store a variety of information about our customers and Website visitors, including any information you may enter on the Website or give to our Website or our stores in any other way. This section describes both the Non-Personal Information and Personal Information we collect and may store.

_Non-Personal Information._ Each time a computer visits this Website we may collect certain information from that computer. This information is automatically collected from the computer's web browser and may include information such as the following, all of which we refer to as "Non-Personal Information":

-the type of web browser software the computer uses (for example, Internet Explorer)  
-the name of the domain from which the computer accessed the Internet  
-the Internet address of the website from which the computer linked directly to the Website  
-the date and time the computer accessed the Website

Non-Personal Information does not tell us who you are.

Also, we may place a text file called a "cookie" in the browser files of computers that visit this Website. Cookies are pieces of information issued by a website that, among other things, allow your computer to use all the features on our Website. If and when your computer accepts a cookie, the cookie may be stored on the computer's hard drive. US Government Information Bulletin (I-034) contains a good description of cookie technology at: <http://www.ciac.org/ciac/bulletins/i-034.shtml>. You are always free to decline our cookies if your browser permits, but some parts of the Website may not work properly for you if you decline the use of a "cookie". Therefore, we recommend that you leave them turned on.

We also collect and track aggregate information such as which pages or features of this Website are used, when, and how often.

We use a third-party service to serve ads on our behalf across the Internet. They may collect anonymous information about your visits to our Web site and your interaction with our products and services. They may also use information about your visits to this and other Web sites to target advertisements for goods and services. This anonymous information is collected through the use of a pixel tag, which is industry standard technology used by many websites. No personally identifiable information is collected or used in the process. They do not know your name, phone number, address, email address, or any personally identifying information about you, the user. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this anonymous information used by our third party provider, please contact us.

_Personal Information._ If you place an order, register, or create a user profile through this Website, provide requested information through the Website, request information from us through the Internet, send us an email address, send us your name or other information, or fill out certain forms that may appear on this Website, you may provide us with information such as your name, address, telephone number, purchase information and history, email address, credit card number, or similar information. All of these items and similar information that specifically identifies who you are constitute "Personal Information". Although you are not required to provide us with any Personal Information, if you decline to do so you will not be able to perform certain actions, such as completing an order.

**HOW DO WE SHARE AND USE INFORMATION?**  
The ways we share, use, and protect information collected over this Website depends upon the type of information involved. However, we share information we collect among the Christopher & Banks family of companies. We also may share information with business partners, carefully selected vendors or other organizations. Our Website or the Christopher & Banks' companies may also share information with companies that provide support services to us or that help us market our products and services. These companies may need information about you in order to perform their functions. These companies typically are not authorized to use that information we share with them for any other purpose.

**PROTECTION OF OUR WEBSITE AND OTHERS**  
We may disclose information you provide to our Website when we believe disclosure is appropriate to comply with the law, to enforce or comply our conditions of use and other agreements or to protect the rights, property or safety of our Website, our users or others.

_Non-Personal Information._ We may use non-personal information to help us make the Website more useful to you and for other business purposes. For example, we may tell certain outside vendors or businesses with whom we do business or are considering doing business ("Trusted Companies") how many computers visited this Website or what pages were most popular. We may prepare reports and other materials using non-personal information. Because Non-Personal Information does not reveal your identity, we do not limit the way we share or use Non-Personal Information, including sharing such information with third parties.

_Personal Information._ If you provide us with Personal Information, you agree that we may keep a record of the Personal Information and use the Personal Information in order to provide goods and services to you. For example, we may keep a record of your name, address, and credit card number in order to process payment for your orders and in order to ship orders. We may use Personal Information to help us in our business, including but not limited to improving this Website and analyzing what items you may be most interested in. We may use Personal Information in order to communicate with you and send you information we think may be of interest to you including marketing information from ourselves or third parties. We also may in the future market our mailing list to selected third parties who may in turn contact you.

We may hire Trusted Companies to assist us with some of these activities or perform them on our behalf, in which case the Trusted Companies will receive access to Personal Information. For example, we may hire a Trusted Company to operate this Website, receive and fulfill orders and provide customer support, send mailings or catalogs for us, or perform similar functions. In such cases, we require the Trusted Company to use the Personal Information only as permitted by us. You agree that we may share Personal Information with these Trusted Companies. Also, we may and in fact do share Personal Information among the Christopher & Banks family of companies, who may use the Personal Information in the same ways as Christopher & Banks, Inc. may as permitted by this Privacy Policy. In the event of a sale, merger, corporate reorganization or similar transaction of some or all of our business we may share your Personal Information with the successor entity, and the successor entity may or may not use and protect Personal Information in the same ways described in this Privacy Policy.

We may engage in joint or collaborative marketing campaigns with other businesses or not-for-profit organizations. However, in such cases, although you may receive a joint message, we will either send the message our self or through a Trusted Company acting on our behalf. As noted above, third parties to whom we provide our mailing list may contact you in the future.

We may share Personal Information if required to comply with a law, regulation, court order, or other legal process, or if we believe it is necessary or desirable to share such information with a government entity. We may share Personal Information to protect our rights or property or if the rights of any third party are jeopardized.
