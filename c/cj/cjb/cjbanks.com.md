We want you to know: (i) what information we gather; (ii) the steps we take to protect the information that you provide us; (iii) how we use that information; and (iv) when we share it with others.

**By using our Websites, or giving us or verifying personal information, you consent to this Privacy Policy.**

By doing business with us, including via our Website at [www.christopherandbanks.com](http://www.christopherandbanks.com/) or interacting with Christopher & Banks in the manner described in this Privacy Policy at any time after the Effective Date, you:

  * consent to the application of this Privacy Policy to you and to the terms and practices described herein;

This Privacy Policy applies to the Christopher & Banks family of companies, which is comprised of Christopher & Banks Corporation and all of our current and future subsidiaries and affiliates (meaning corporations under the same control, to which we may refer as “Legal Affiliates” or “we”, “us” and “our”) and to include our Website which is operated with the assistance of certain third parties. This Privacy Policy does not apply to any other companies or websites, and we are not responsible for the privacy policies or practices of websites operated by others, even if they are linked to our Website. This Privacy Policy specifically does not apply to businesses that we may refer to as “Marketing Affiliates”, “marketing partners”, “third party partners” or “vendors”, all of which are unrelated to us

**WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?**

We collect a variety of information about our customers and Website visitors. This section describes both the Non-Personal Information and Personal Information we collect. The information you provide may be used by the Company in its retail business, its online business, to fulfill orders, to operate its loyalty program and its private label credit card program and to communicate with customers regarding offers of goods, promotions or other benefits from us or our third party partners that Christopher & Banks reasonably believes may be of interest to all or certain of its customers based upon customer demographics, buying history or other reasons.

_Non-Personal Information Collected Automatically_. Each time a computer or other device (collectively, a “computer”) visits our Website, we may automatically collect certain information from that computer, although the user remains anonymous unless he or she voluntarily identifies himself or herself. Information that is automatically collected may include (but is not limited to) the following, all of which we refer to as “Non-Personal Information”:

  * characteristics about your browser, operating system and computer you use to access our website
  * the name of the domain and host from which the computer accessed the Internet;
  * the Internet address of any website from which the computer linked;
  * the Internet Protocol (IP) address of the computer you are using; and
  * the date and time the computer accessed the Website.



Non-Personal Information does not tell us who you are, although it may identify the computer that you are using and how you are using it.

Also, we may place a file called a “cookie” or a “pixel” on computers that visit our Website. Cookies are small data files for record-keeping, administration or to customize your experience. They may be used by us and our marketing partners to allow your computer to use all the features on our Website. You may enable, disable, block or remove cookies on your computer by following the instructions on your Web browser. While cookies are not required to shop our site, they are necessary for certain functions on our site to work, and therefore we recommend allowing their use. For example, with cookies enabled you can take advantage of express checkout when you make a purchase. This means you may not have to retype your billing and shipping information each time you shop. As another example, we may use cookies to populate information for returning visitors who have logged into our site to give them access to personalized features and settings. We also may use cookies to recognize customer traffic patterns and site use on an anonymous basis. This information can help us improve the site’s layout and design, including the features and personalization that we can offer returning users.

On our Website, we also collect and track aggregate information, such as which pages or features of our Website are used, when and how often. On occasion, we may combine information you provide or that we track with other demographic information or web activity available to us.

We use a third-party service to publish ads on our behalf across the Internet. This third-party service may collect anonymous information about your visits to our Website and other websites and your interaction with our products and services, as well as with websites generally. They may also use information about your visits to this and other websites to target advertisements for goods and services. They also enable us to collect the following types of information: pages visited, products viewed and/or purchased, search term usage and other common website metrics. This information helps us to learn things like what pages are most attractive to our customers, which of our products most interest our customers and what kinds of offers our customers like to see. This is often called “behavioral advertising.” This information is collected through the use of a pixel tag, which is industry standard technology used by many websites. No personally identifiable information is collected or used in the process and it does not reflect your name, phone number, address, e-mail address or any personally identifying information about you, the user. Our Website does not respond to “do not track” requests from browsers.

If you would like more information about behavioral advertising or to opt out of behavior advertising, please [click here](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/).

_Personal Information that You Choose to Provide Us._ You may provide us information about yourself through our Website, in person, in a store, by our store personnel using point of sale systems, by phone or mail, through social networking and similar websites, by e-mail or text messages, and in other ways. For example, you will give us information if you place an order; create a user profile, provide requested information as part of a loyalty program, credit card application or employment application, or a registration; request information from us; send us an e-mail or text message; send us your name or other information; enter a contest or sweepstakes; follow or interact with us on social media; or fill out certain forms related to our business of selling women’s clothing or in response to a marketing program or other promotion that we may be involved in. The information that you provide to us may include your name, address, telephone number, purchase information and history, e-mail address, and credit card number, as well as other information. You may also provide us with the name and address of a gift recipient.

If you apply for a Christopher & Banks credit card online, you will be providing your Personal Information directly to the issuing bank for the Christopher & Banks credit card. However, your name, address, phone number, birth date and credit card number, as well as any additional information necessary for us to provide you with the perks and privileges of the Christopher & Banks credit card, may be provided to us by the card issuer."

Your full name in connection with one or more of the following pieces of information is referred to in this Privacy Policy as “Personal Information”: your mailing address, telephone number, e-mail address, or credit card number. Although you are not required to provide us with any Personal Information, if you decline to do so you may not be able to perform certain actions, such as completing an order, ordering a gift card, or joining any loyalty or reward program that we might offer.

From time-to-time, we may supplement the information you give us with information from other sources, such as information validating your address or demographic information based on your zip code. We may also supplement the information you give us with information we collect from you in other ways. For example, if you shop at one of our stores, we may supplement the information you provide online with information we collect at the store.

In this Privacy Policy, we refer collectively to Non-Personal Information, Personal Information, and combined information as “information.”

**HOW DO WE SHARE AND USE INFORMATION?**

_Non-Personal Information._ As stated above, we and third parties may use Non-Personal Information to help us make the Website more useful to you and for other business purposes. For example, we or our Marketing Affiliates may learn how many computers visited our Website or what pages were most popular. We or our Marketing Affiliates may prepare reports and analyses using such Non-Personal Information.

We may combine this Non-Personal Information with Personal Information and use and share the combined information in the ways described in this Privacy Policy.

_Personal Information._ We may use Personal Information in the following ways:

To Provide Goods and Services to You. If you provide us with Personal Information, we may keep a record of the Personal Information and use the Personal Information in order to provide goods and services to you. For example, we may keep a record of your name, address, other contact information and credit card number in order to process payment for your orders and in order to ship orders and to answer questions about the status of your order. We may also use Personal Information to improve our Website and to analyze what items you may be most interested in and suggest those items to you. We may use Personal Information in order to communicate with you, and to send you information we think may be of interest to you, including marketing information from ourselves or our third party partners.

To Share with Third Parties. We may share your information with selected third parties as described in this Privacy Policy. For example, we share your information with the Marketing Affiliates that we hire to operate our Website, receive and fulfill orders, provide customer support and other support services, assist us in the administration of our loyalty program, send emails, mailings or catalogs for us, market our products or services, or perform other services for us. In such cases, we will direct the Marketing Affiliate to use and protect the information in a manner consistent with this Privacy Policy to the extent we are able to do so. Our Marketing Affiliates are not authorized to use your information for any purposes other than to provide services to us. As stated above, the term “we” includes the Christopher & Banks family of companies, each member of which may therefore use and share the information as permitted by this Privacy Policy.

From time-to-time we may share your information or our mailing lists (both US Mail and e-mail) with marketing partners that may jointly with us or independently contact you or market to you. We also may utilize service providers to assist us in aggregating customer information. We may then share such aggregated information with prospective marketing partners and advertisers. We will direct marketing partners and advertisers to use and protect the information in a manner consistent with this Privacy Policy.

To Conduct Contests, Sweepstakes, Promotions and Surveys. When Christopher & Banks conducts contests, sweepstakes, promotions and surveys, or joins with other companies to do so, if you choose to participate you may be asked to provide Personal Information. Christopher & Banks and the other participating companies may use this information for such purposes as notifying winners and fulfilling promotional obligations, and may also cross reference customer databases to identify common customers. Information from these activities may be used to explore future promotional opportunities or fulfill contractual obligations with respect to such contests, sweepstakes, etc. Even if you have previously chosen not to receive communications from Christopher & Banks prior to your participation in a contest, sweepstakes, promotion or survey, by so participating you opt in to again receive information and communications from Christopher & Banks. You may choose not to participate in contests, sweepstakes, promotions or surveys if you do not wish to receive information from Christopher & Banks or to share your information with Christopher & Banks and the other companies sponsoring such activities.

To Comply with the Law. We may share your information if required to comply with a law, regulation, court order or legal process, or if we believe it is necessary to share such information with a government entity. We may share information to protect our rights or property or if the rights of any third party are jeopardized.

Further, as we are a U.S.-based company and your Personal Information will generally be stored in our offices and with our service providers in the United States, such Personal Information will be subject to the laws of the government of the United States of America. This means that it may be accessed by certain authorities (including under the USA Patriot Act) without your consent or knowledge. If you would like further information about our policies in this regard, you may contact our Chief Privacy Officer as described below.

**OPTING IN AND OUT FOR ADVERTISING AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS**

As stated above, we and third parties acting on our behalf may contact you and market to you, including by e-mail, Internet connection, text, telephone, fax or mail, consistent with this Privacy Policy and applicable law. We permit you to opt out of promotional and marketing communications as follows. Our various communication lists are administered separately, so it is necessary to opt out of each separately; opting out of one form of communication does not automatically opt you out from others. We expect and direct third parties with whom we share your information (other than third parties providing support services only on our behalf) to also allow you to opt out of future e-mail and texting marketing communications. Participation in certain of our programs, including any loyalty program, may require you to accept e-mail communications regarding the program itself.

E-mail: To opt out of receiving promotional e-mail communications, click the “Unsubscribe” link at the bottom of the e-mail that you receive or [click here](https://www.christopherandbanks.com/coreg/index.jsp?step=register) to unsubscribe from future e-mails.

Text Messages: You will only receive promotional text messages from Christopher & Banks if you expressly opt in to receive such messages. If you would like to stop receiving promotional text messages from Christopher & Banks, reply to a text message you receive from us with the word “STOP”.

US Mail and Phone: You may opt out of receiving phone calls and mailings by US Mail by contacting us as described in “Our Contact Information” below.

It may take us a number of days to complete the process to remove you from our communication distribution lists, as is permitted by law. If you do not want us to share any of your Personal Information with third parties (other than our service providers or as required by law), please contact us at CRM Department, Christopher & Banks, Inc., 2400 Xenium Lane North, Plymouth, Minnesota 55441 and we will remove you from our database. Taking certain actions after making such a request, such as placing an order or signing up for our loyalty program, will result in you being added back to our database, and as a result, your Personal Information may be shared with third parties as described in this Privacy Policy.

**OUR OWNERSHIP OF INFORMATION**

Our copy of all your information is an asset of ours and belongs to us. In the event of a sale, merger, corporate reorganization or similar transaction involving some or all of our business, we may share with or transfer your information to the buyer or successor entity. Because one of the purposes for which Christopher & Banks collects, uses and/or discloses personal information is the operation of its business, in the event that all or part of the assets of Christopher & Banks are sold to a new owner, all Personal Information, or that part of the Personal Information associated with the assets being sold, will be transferred (disclosed) to the new owners, subject to certain conditions. We may also continue to retain a copy of that Personal Information.

**SECURITY**

Your information is stored on servers located in the United States. We and the vendors who help us with hosting and security use a number of physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to help protect your information. However, there is no such thing as perfect security. You agree that we are not responsible for the unlawful actions of third parties or the consequences of such actions. You should take your own steps to protect your own computer systems and data from viruses, hackers, identity thieves and other risks.

We use the industry standard encryption protocol known as Secure Socket Layer (SSL) to keep your order information secure. SSL encryption has been established for every transaction made through our Websites.

If any unauthorized charges were to appear on your credit card as a result of shopping with our Website, you should immediately notify your credit card provider in accordance with its reporting rules and procedures.
