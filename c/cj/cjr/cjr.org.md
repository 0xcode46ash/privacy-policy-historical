**Privacy Policy**

CJR is committed to protecting your privacy. We do not currently collect personally identifiable information, except in specific instances, such as signing up for our e-mail list. 

Like most websites, CJR does collect non-personal information, such as IP addresses of visitors and data about the usage of pages.

We may also disclose aggregated non-personal information to third parties for marketing purposes.

**Comments Policy**

We ask our readers to express opinions in a manner respectful to the readers and writers of CJR. Criticism of ideas is strongly encouraged, but personal, ad hominem attacks will result in deletion of posted comments and, potentially, banning of the individual user. CJR reserves the right to edit or delete, for reasons of content, comments submitted to CJR.

CJR reserves the right to edit or delete your comment posting if you, or anyone using your account, violates one of these rules: 

Comments that do not provide a valid e-mail address at which the user associated with it receives e-mail; 

Comments that violate local, state, or federal laws, promote commercial products or services, impersonate another person or entity, or solicit or encourage illegal activity; 

Comments that libel or defame any other individual or party; 

Comments that are abusive, that threaten or harass another individual, are overly antagonistic, deliberately inflammatory, or ad hominem in nature. 

Comments that contain excessive punctuation or capitalization designed solely to pump up the volume of a post. 

Comments which CJR and parties contracted by CJR deem to be otherwise objectionable, inappropriate, off-topic, or offensive.

CJR reserves the right to remove users / commenters permanently for any of the following: 

Violating any of the rules above more than once. 

Using non-working, outdated e-mail addresses in one’s account.
