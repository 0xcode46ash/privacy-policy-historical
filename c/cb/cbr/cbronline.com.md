# CBR Online Latest News: Privacy Policy

**CBR Online Privacy Policy**  
CBR Online considers the privacy of its clients to be of utmost importance and is committed to protecting the privacy of its users. This statement  
outlines our privacy and data protection policy. Steps have been taken to ensure that consistently high standards of data protection are adhered to in  
all regional offices for all the forms of processing mentioned.

**Collection and Use of User Details**

Personal details of users of CBR Online will be collected and processed upon registration to our website. All personal information is collected with the  
knowledge of our customers via the Website's order and registration forms only. CBR Online and ComputerWire fully conform to the Data Protection  
Act 1998.

**Why we ask for this information**

We ask for information to find out more about our users in general. This helps us improve our service to you, and allows us to give our advertisers and  
partners a clear idea of who uses our site and what their interests are. We also log hits on our web pages and use them in aggregate to see what kind  
of users visit which parts of the site.

**Sending you e-mail**

If you sign up for CBR Online's news alerting service, we will send you e-mail to alert you to stories that match your personal alerting profile. These  
e-mails may contain targeted promotional messages.   
The Computer Business Review web site 

_www.cbronline.com_

is free to access, and is supported by banner advertising and occasional Email list rentals by interested 3rd parties.   
Any user information collected through forms, or newsletter subscriptions on this web site are only shared with advertisers or any other third parties in aggregate form.   
Unsubscribe details can be found within all Email broadcasts.

**Using cookies**

Cookies are small files that are placed on your computer by your browser. We use them to save information that helps you make the most of our  
service. You can disable cookies by changing your browser preferences, but may find you have to enter the same information over and over again if you  
use a personalised part of the CBR Online service regularly. A subscriber will have the cookie linked to their e-mail address as a way of identifying them.  
We do not link this information to users' personal details. 

**Protecting your privacy**

For some parts of the CBR Online service, we may issue you with a password which allows you to access and amend your personal details. It is  
your responsibility to keep this password secret. We will strive to protect your personal information, but because of the way information is transmitted  
over the Internet, we cannot guarantee its security.

**Security Policy**

CBR Online will maintain appropriate measures to ensure that users' personal details are not misused, accidentally destroyed, lost or altered  
within the CBR Online server environment. 

Occasions will arise when customer information is passed outside ComputerWire to other data processors (i.e. fulfilment bureaux,  
database consultants etc.) but they will only act upon instruction from CBR Online in order to perform the services required.

**Changes to this policy**

Our privacy policy may change from time to time. If it does, we will update this page. 

**Updating Customer Details**

It is important to us that we have your correct contact information so that you don't miss out on further correspondence or experience problems with the  
delivery of products
