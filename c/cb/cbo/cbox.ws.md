# Cbox · Privacy Policy · Chat and Tag for the Social Web

Cbox is committed to maintaining your privacy and keeping your personal information confidential, and extends this policy to the third party users of your Cbox as well. 

## Contact details

We require your email address in order to send you important information regarding your account. Your address is not listed publicly and will never be made available to third-parties. No other contact details are required by us, but they may be required by third-party payment processors should you purchase paid products or services from us. 

## Cookies

Cbox uses cookies in five contexts: 

  1. To handle sessions when you log in to administrate your Cbox at the control panel located at http://cbox.ws/admin.php. 
  2. To handle sessions when you and third-party users view and/or transmit messages on your Cbox. 
  3. To store temporarily the chosen screen name and other information provided by visitors who post in your Cbox. 
  4. To limit the number of times visitors are served advertisements by Cbox Applications that employ advertising. 



Importantly, none of these cookies is readable by other websites or users. Only cookies used in context (3) potentially contain any personally-identifiable information, but this information is no more than that which is submitted by users themselves when they transmit messages on Cbox Applications.
