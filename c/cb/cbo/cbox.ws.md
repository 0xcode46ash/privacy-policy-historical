# Cbox Â· Privacy Policy

Last updated: January 22, 2015

Cbox is serious about your privacy and keeping your personal information confidential. We will not sell, rent, or otherwise give away your personal information without your consent. 

Remember that any material that you post in a Cbox should be assumed to be public. You should not give away any personally-identifying information, at the request of another user or otherwise. 

## Contact details

We require your email address when you sign up for a Cbox, in order to send you important information regarding your account. Your address is not listed publicly and will never be made available to third parties. No other contact details are required by us, but they may be required by third-party payment processors should you purchase paid services from us. 

## Cookies

Cbox may send cookies to your browser under some circumstances, in order to improve your experience of the service. There are generally two contexts in which cookies are used: 

  1. To remember authentication status when you log in to the control panel or your Cbox. 
  2. For the collection non-personally-identifying aggregate statistics about visitors' engagement. 



We do not store any important information such as passwords or IP addresses in cookies, not even in encrypted form. 

## Third Party Cookies

Our third-party service providers may send cookies to your browser as part of their operations. We are careful to ensure that third-party cookies do not violate our own cookie policy. 

## IP Addresses

Internet Protocol (IP) addresses are logged in the course of using this website and its Applications, for the purposes of: 

  1. Aggregate statistical analysis of visitor engagement.
  2. Limiting access to the service by users who have violated our Terms and Conditions of Service. 
  3. Providing Cbox administrators with the ability to block users on their own Cboxes.



Note that while we do not publish IP addresses and cannot assist in retrieving them, your IP address is stored with each message you post on any Cbox, and is available to the administrator of that Cbox. That administrator is bound by our Terms of Service to extend our privacy policy to you.
