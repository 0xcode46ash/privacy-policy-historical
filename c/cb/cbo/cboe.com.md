# Privacy Statement

Last Updated: May 27, 2016

Cboe Exchange, Inc. and its affiliates (collectively, "Cboe") has created this Privacy Statement and Policy in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to the privacy of the users of a Cboe World Wide Website ("Website"). By using or accessing the Website, you signify your acknowledgment and assent to the Privacy Statement and Policy set forth below.

## Notice of Changes

Cboe reserves the right to change or update this Privacy Statement and Policy or the Terms and Conditions for use of the Website at any time. Accordingly, if such changes are made, we will disclose those changes on the Website so that users are aware of our policies concerning information collection, use, and disclosure. Any changes or updates will be effective immediately upon posting to the Website.

## Information Collection and Dissemination

Except as otherwise provided in this Privacy Statement and Policy, the following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for the Website.

In general, users can visit the Website anonymously without providing any personal information. There are, however, cases where users may be asked for personal information. For example, online surveys are occasionally conducted to better understand the needs and profiles of our Website users. Our online surveys typically ask users for demographic and profile information such as zip code, age, and income level. In addition, personal information is requested if you voluntarily register to receive additional information about Cboe or if you want to purchase a product directly from the Website. Our voluntary Website registration form requests user personal information such as name, mailing address and/or e-mail address. Registered Users have certain "opt-out" choices which are described in the choice/opt-out section below. 

In connection with your use of forums, discussion boards, social networking or other interactive portions of the Website certain personal information such as your name and affiliation may be collected in connection with your user profile. Such personal information will be made publicly accessible and certain portions thereof may be automatically annotated to or linked to postings you make to the Website. Cboe shall have no obligation to protect the privacy or confidentiality of such profile information or any information that you post to any interactive portion of the Website.

Cboe shares information with advertisers on an aggregate basis, but users should refer to the privacy statements (accessible below) of the service providers to the Website for their policies regarding use of personal information.

## Security

Cboe shall exercise reasonable precautions to safeguard and secure all information provided by users in connection with accessing this Website. The Website has security protections in place that help to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. Security protections use technology consistent with current industry standards as existing from time to time. Cboe periodically tests the security protections of its information systems and monitors the effectiveness of its information security controls, systems and procedures. Although we take proper measures to safeguard against unauthorized disclosures of information and because such information can be accessed through the Internet, no assurances can be provided to users that personally identifiable information that we collect will never be disclosed in a manner that is inconsistent with this Privacy Statement and Policy.

## Data Retention

The Website will retain your information for as long as your myCboe account (if applicable) is active or as needed to provide you with products or services. If you wish to cancel your myCboe account or request that we no longer use your information to provide you products or services contact us using the information provided below.

## Logged Files

The Website logs IP addresses and browser types for administration purposes, including logging the IP addresses associated with each post to or use of the Website. Such logs will be reviewed in order to improve the materials and content available on the Website. In addition, such information will be used to assist law enforcement activities and in connection with investigations, questions, claims or complaints relating to postings to or use of the Website.

## Cookies

A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user's hard disk or browser which can be used by a Website to enable its users to store tailored information from the Website. Cboe uses cookies to better serve our users when they return to our Website by storing user authentication information and setting selections. A cookie does not retrieve any other data from your hard drive. You can set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether to accept it. You may continue browsing our Website even if you decide not to accept the cookie, however certain capabilities of the Website may be impaired. For more information about cookies, including how to set your internet browser to reject cookies, please go to [www.allaboutcookies.org](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/).

## Links to Third-Party Websites and Framing

For the user's convenience, cboe.com provides links to other external websites. The listing of a link by Cboe should not be construed as a sponsorship, endorsement or approval of such websites, their content, or as an indication of the value of any claims, recommendations or other information contained therein. It is strongly advised that a qualified investment professional be consulted prior to engaging in any transactions. Users should be aware that Cboe has no control over any linked website and is not responsible for the contents or privacy practices of any linked website or any link on a linked website. Cboe urges our users to be aware when they exit the Website and to carefully read the privacy statements of each website that collects user identifiable information. The Website Privacy Statement and Policy is applicable only to information collected by the Website.

Cboe prohibits the framing of any materials available through its Website, caching, or unauthorized hypertext links to the Website. Cboe reserves the right to disconnect or otherwise disable any unauthorized frames or hypertext links.
