                     CENTER ON BUDGET AND POLICY PRIORITIES
           CONFIDENTIALITY & PRIVACY POLICIES AND PROCEDURES
The following Confidentiality and Privacy Policies and Procedures were developed by the Center on
Budget and Policy Priorities and adopted by the Center’s Board of Directors. This set of policies
and procedures formally documents our policies for ensuring the privacy and confidentiality of
information the Center utilizes in carrying out its development activities.
Donor Privacy Statement
The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities respects the privacy of our donors. We protect personal
information. We do not rent, sell or trade our mailing lists. Name, address and other information
provided by a donor will be used appropriately to provide information on Center activities including
new research, status of policy debates, special events, or fundraising needs and to acknowledge
donations. If at any time a donor wishes to not be acknowledged or to receive less mail or wishes to
be removed from any of our communications they can do so by contacting us by phone at 202 408-
1080 or via e-mail at: Greenberg@cbpp.org and we will gladly accommodate the request.
Confidentiality Statement
The Center strongly believes in protecting the privacy of our philanthropic donors and prospective
donors and the confidentiality of information concerning them. Donor records and other donor
information are highly confidential and protected by organizational policy. The use of information
for political or commercial purposes is strictly prohibited. Appropriate action, including but not
limited to actions that may lead to termination of employment, will be taken against persons, or
entities that violate these policies. Any individual, institution, or agency deemed to have violated
these policies, or deemed to have jeopardized the confidentiality or privacy of any individual or
organization affiliated with the Center by the inappropriate use of information provided in
accordance with these policies will not be permitted access to information in the future.
Professional Standards and Privacy Practices
All employees of the Department of Development and External Affairs will read and abide by the
Center’s Confidentiality Policies and Procedures, the Association of Professional Researchers for
Advancement’s (APRA’s) ethics guidelines, and the “Donor Bill of Rights” developed by the
Association of Fundraising Professionals (attached). These documents can be obtained from the
Department of Development and External Affairs and will be automatically provided to new
department employees, and members of senior management, board members or other volunteers


who are engaged in fundraising activities. They also can be found in the Department of
Development and External Affair’s Procedures Manual.
All development staff, as well as senior managers and volunteers that have access to restricted
information will be required to sign the Center’s Confidentiality Agreement. Restricted information
includes donor giving histories, personal, financial, and/or legal information that is publicly available
and collected during the prospect research process or provided by the donor or prospect
himself/herself. Safeguards are in place to ensure that the information is not disclosed or shared
more widely than is necessary to achieve the purpose for which it was gathered. We also take
measures to ensure the accuracy/integrity of this information is maintained
Donors are provided with an opportunity to be anonymous and to request that their name and/or
the amount of their gift not be publicly released. Donors who request anonymity, either for gifts or
for themselves, will be publicly acknowledged as “anonymous.” Information on anonymous donors
will be flagged prominently as “anonymous” in all paper files and computer records.
Individual Donor Records
Individual Donor records, whether in hard copy or electronic form, are the property of the Center
on Budget and Policy Priorities. These records contain specific information pertaining to those
individuals important to the development efforts of the Center. Individual Donor records are kept
in the office of the Director of Development and External Affairs in a secure desk or file drawer
that will be locked outside of normal work hours.
Information kept in development records must be relevant to the goals of the Development
Department. It is the responsibility of each Development staff member, senior manager, board
member, or volunteer to submit only appropriate and relevant information for inclusion in files.
Credit card numbers will be blocked out when they are no longer necessary. If any credit card
numbers are found on former correspondence in a file, they should be blocked out immediately.
Access to the donor database (Raiser’s Edge) is maintained and authorized by the Director of
Development and External Affairs. Security procedures are in place to ensure that different users’
have access to only those screens that are necessary to carry out their Center business.
In general, restricted or sensitive donor information will not be provided via email. However, in
those cases where it is necessary (ie. due to time sensitivity or other unforeseen reasons), Center staff
will use all possible cautions to protect confidentiality.
The Finance and Administration Office, as well as external auditors and any regulatory agency personnel and people
operating pursuant to legal process that may be conducting audits, reviews, or other investigations, may require
access to all hard copy and electronic files in the development records in order to conduct their work.
Information Requests from External (Non-Center) Sources
External sources requesting information such as the media may be given access to public or
published information at the discretion of the Director of Development and External Affairs. Only
public information will be released and only if not coded “anonymous” “no contact” or “unlisted”.

Proprietary restricted information such as research profiles, action reports, financial records
and giving histories will not be released under any circumstances unless consent is provided
by the donor. All media requests related to donors are forwarded to the Director of Development
and External Affairs.
Outside consultants and vendors such as direct mail firms, mailing houses, publication publishers,
and database screening firms, will be bound by this confidentiality policy and confidentiality
provisions will be included in contracts to such entities.
