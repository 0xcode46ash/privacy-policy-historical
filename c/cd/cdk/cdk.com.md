# Privacy Policy | CDK Global

## Use of CDK Global website and associated pages

CDK Global (UK) Limited and its subsidiaries and affiliates (hereinafter **CDK** or **we** ) are committed to protecting the privacy and security of your Personal Information collected or generated in connection with your relationship with CDK (“Personal Information”). 

CDK is a **Data Controller** which means that we are responsible for deciding how we may collect and use personal information you provide to us either directly or through the use of our website and HTML based emails. This notice explains our practices with regard to your Personal Information and how we comply with the General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679 ( **GDPR** ).

CDK is made up of various legal entities trading in different countries. These entities are all ultimately controlled by the same entity – CDK Global, LLC.  When you provide information through our website, you will be providing it to CDK as a whole. Your information may be stored in and accessed from countries outside of the EEA whose laws provide various levels of protection for personal data, not always equivalent to the level of protection that may be provided in your own country. CDK have taken steps through the implementation of model clauses between CDK legal entities and contractual requirements with third parties to ensure an adequate level of protection. 

**Personal Information** means any information about an individual from which that person can be identified. It does not include data where the identity has been removed (anonymous data).  There are "special categories" of more sensitive personal data which require a higher level of protection, such as information about a person's health or sexual orientation. The term **process** used in in this Privacy Notice means any operation performed upon Personal Information, whether or not by automated means, such as collection, recording, organization, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure or dissemination, transfer, sharing and erasure or destruction.

  9. Rights of Access, correction, deletion and restriction

**

Under certain circumstances, by law you have the rights listed below in relation to your Personal Information. You will not usually have to pay a fee to access your Personal Information (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request for access is unfounded or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with the request in such circumstances.

We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access the information (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is another appropriate security measure to ensure that Personal Information is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it.

If you would like to make a data subject request please use the following contact details: [privacy@cdkglobal.com](mailto:privacy@cdkglobal.com)

**_Request access_** **** to your Personal Information (commonly known as a "data subject access request"). This enables you to receive a copy of the Personal Information we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.   
Your right to access your Personal Information may be limited or denied where the burden or expense of providing access would be disproportionate to the risks to your privacy in question, or when such access would:

  * compromise confidential commercial information; 
  * interfere with the execution or enforcement of the law or with private causes of action including the prevention, investigation or detection of offenses or the right to a fair trial; 
  * violate the legitimate rights or important interests of others; 
  * breach a legal or other professional privilege or obligation; 
  * prejudice employee security investigations or grievance proceedings or in connection with employee succession planning or corporate re-organizations; 
  * prejudice the confidentiality necessary in monitoring, inspection or regulatory functions connected with sound management, or in future or ongoing negotiations involving CDK. 



**Request correction** **** of the Personal Information that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate information we hold about you corrected. Please note that you have a shared responsibility with regard to the accuracy of your Personal Information.  When updating your Personal Information, you must provide truthful, complete and accurate information.  

**Request deletion** of your Personal Information. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove Personal Information where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your Personal Information where you have exercised your right to object to processing (see below).

**Object to processing** of your Personal Information where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground. You also have the right to object where we are processing your Personal Information for direct marketing purposes.

**Request the restriction of processing** **** of your Personal Information. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of Personal Information about you, for example if you want us to establish its accuracy or the reason for processing it.

**Request the transfer** **** of your Personal Information to another party. 

**Right to withdraw consent:** __In the limited circumstances where you may have provided your consent to the collection, processing and transfer of your Personal Information for a specific purpose, you have the right to withdraw your consent for that specific processing at any time. To withdraw your consent, please contact[privacy@cdk.com](mailto:privacy@cdk.com). Once we have received notification that you have withdrawn your consent, we will no longer process your information for the purpose or purposes you originally agreed to, unless we have another legitimate basis for doing so in law.

**

  10. Choice 

**

If your Personal Information is:

  * to be disclosed to a third party (other than CDK’s agent acting on CDK’s behalf), or 
  * to be used for a purpose that is materially different from the purpose for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized,



CDK will inform you and give you a chance to object to such disclosure or use (opt-out).  

If such information is sensitive Personal Information, CDK will only disclose it to a third party (other than CDK’s agent acting on CDK’s behalf) or use it for a purpose that is materially different from the purpose for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized after you have given your consent affirmatively and explicitly (opt-in).  However, your opt-in is not required in the rare occasions when the disclosure of the sensitive Personal Information is:

  * in the vital interests of you or another person; 
  * necessary for the establishment of legal claims or defenses; 
  * required to provide medical care or diagnosis; 
  * necessary to carry out the organization’s contractual obligations, or
  * related to Personal Information that is manifestly made public by you.
