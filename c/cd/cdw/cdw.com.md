# Privacy Policy

**_Information You Provide_** __

We collect information you provide when you use our Sites from one or more devices associated with you, or that you provide in any other way, including over the phone or on paper. For example, we may collect your name, work title, email address, postal address, phone number, demographics, payment and order information, user ID, password, and other information you may provide on our Sites, such as when you complete a transaction, register for an account, log in to our Sites, subscribe to or request our services, participate in an event, contest or survey, or contact our customer service representatives.

**_Information from Other Sources_** __

We may also obtain information about you from other sources and combine that with information we collect either on our Sites or directly from you. As examples, we may obtain demographic data from third-party data providers to better market to you, or we may purchase or lease lists from list brokers to correct or supplement information about you.

**_Information Automatically Collected - Cookies & Similar Tracking Technologies_** __

When you visit our Sites, some information about your visit is automatically collected, such as your device's operating system, application software, Internet Protocol (IP) address, access times, browser type and language, peripherals, user log data, Active Directory information, and the websites you visited before and after our Sites. We also collect (directly or via third parties) information about your usage and activity on our Sites, including information about your orders, purchases, and cart activity through essential and non-essential cookies, Web beacons, and similar tracking technologies (collectively, "Cookies"). 

Cookies are small data files stored on your hard drive, our Site or our emails, which we use to provide and improve our Sites and your experience, such as to see which areas and features are popular, count visits to our Sites, understand usage and campaign effectiveness on our Sites and other websites you may visit, and/or tell if an email has been opened and acted upon. 

_**Personalized Ads**_

We may also use and allow third parties to place Cookies on our Sites to collect information about your online activities over time and across websites, including our Sites and other websites you may  visit. We may use this information and other information about you, including order and cart activity information, to try to understand your interests and show you advertising and information about products and services offered by CDW and its partners that may interest you.

Certain third-party ad services may also use information collected via Cookies, as well as your IP address, your ISP, and the browser and device you use to visit our Sites in order to deliver advertising relevant to your interests and to better understand the usage and visitation of our Sites and the other sites tracked by these third parties.      

This Policy does not apply to, and we are not responsible for, third-party Cookies, and we encourage you to check the privacy policies of advertisers and/or ad services to learn about their use of cookies and other technology.

Many Web browsers are set to accept Cookies by default, and only you have the ability to manage your browser settings. If you prefer, you can usually choose to set your browser to remove and reject certain Cookies. To find out more about Cookies used for personalized ads in the US and Canada, including the choices you may have, please visit our [About Cookies page](https://web.archive.org/content/cdw/en/terms-conditions/about-cookies.html "CDW Cookie Policy") as well as the [Digital Advertising Alliance-US](http://optout.aboutads.info/#/ "US Digital Advertising Alliance"), [Network Advertising Initiative](http://optout.networkadvertising.org/#/ "Network Advertising Initiative"), [Digital Advertising Alliance-Canada](http://youradchoices.ca/choices "Digital Advertising Alliance - Canada"), [European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance](http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/ "European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance"), and/or your device settings for our mobile app. For UK visitors, see our [UK Cookie Policy](https://uk.cdw.com/site-tools/cookie-policy/ "UK CDW Cookie Policy") for more information

If you delete your Cookies, use a different browser, or buy a new computer, you will need to renew your choices. Please visit the respective privacy policies and/or review the privacy settings of the social networking services you use, to make choices about online advertising on those services. While we and others give you choices described in this Policy, there are many ways Web browser signals and other similar mechanisms can indicate your choice to disable tracking, and we may not be aware of or honor every mechanism. 

Although you may opt-out of receiving personalized ads from one network, you may still receive ads from other ad networks you did not opt out of or ads that are not personalized to your interests.

_**Do Not Track**_

Some Internet browsers include the ability to transmit “Do Not Track” signals. Since uniform standards for “Do Not Track” signals have not been adopted, CDW does not process or respond to “Do Not Track” signals. 

_**California Privacy Rights**_

If you are a California resident, you may have the right to request information from us about how we may share certain information about you with third parties for their own direct marketing purposes. Please see the your rights and choices section below for details on the choices you may have regarding such sharing of your information.
