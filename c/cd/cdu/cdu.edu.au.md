        •     To establish an individual’s identity for the purposes of admission to a course of study;
        •     To establish an individual’s identity for the purposes of employment;

        •     From time to time, for other necessary purposes as they arise.
The University will ensure that when collecting personal and/or sensitive information, the individual will be
informed as to:
      •   The purpose for which the information is collected;
      •   Whether all fields of a form are compulsory or some are optional;
      •   How the information is usually used and to whom it is usually disclosed;
      •   That the University's Information Privacy Policy is accessible on the University website;

      •   The individual consents to the collection from someone else;
      •   The University is required or authorised by, or under, an Australian law, or a court / tribunal order, to
          collect the information from someone else; or

      •   The individual would reasonably expect the University to use or disclose the information for that purpose;
          and

The University may not use or disclose sensitive information about an individual for the purpose of direct
marketing unless the individual has consented to the use or disclosure of the information for that purpose.
Overseas Disclosures

will take such steps as are reasonable in the circumstances to ensure that the overseas recipient will protect
privacy under standards similar to the Northern Territory Information Privacy Principles.

information may be sent electronically or through the mail to that individual in that country.

parties, such as:
