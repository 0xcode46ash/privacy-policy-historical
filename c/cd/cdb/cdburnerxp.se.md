## Echo Nest music identification

For music identification (if you use the feature), CDBurnerXP generates a fingerprint of the song you identify (basically a “compressed” version of the music that only is a few KB in size) and submits it to EchoNest servers. No further data that identifies yourself or your file is submitted. 

You may also want to check the [EchoNest privacy policy](http://the.echonest.com/privacy/ "http://the.echonest.com/privacy/").
