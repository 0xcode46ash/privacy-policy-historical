 **CoverUniverse and Cookies**

Upon your first visit to CoverUniverse, CoverUniverse sends a "cookie" to your computer. A cookie is a piece of data that identifies you as a unique user. CoverUniverse uses cookies to improve the quality of our service and to understand our user base more. CoverUniverse does this by storing user preferences in cookies. CoverUniverse will not disclose its cookies to third parties.

Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. You can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. Beaware, however, that some parts of the CoverUniverse Search Service may not function properly if you refuse cookies.

 **Third party advertising**

We use MaxOnline and other third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our web site. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other web sites in order to provide advertisements on this site and other sites about goods and services that may be of interest to you.

 **Third party cookies**

In the course of serving advertisements to this site, our third-party advertiser may place or recognize a unique "cookie" on your browser.

 **What Information Do We Collect?**

CoverUniverse does not collect any unique information about you (such as your name, email address, etc.) except when you specifically and knowingly provide such information. CoverUniverse notes and saves information such as IP address and country code. That information is used to verify our records and to provide more relevant services to users. For example, CoverUniverse may use your IP address or browser language to determine which language to use when showing search results or advertisements.

 **Links to Other Sites**

The sites displayed as search results or linked to by CoverUniverse Search Services are developed by people over whom CoverUniverse exercises no control. These other sites may send their own cookies to users, collect data, or solicit personal information. CoverUniverse may choose to exhibit its search results in the form of a "URL redirecter." When CoverUniverse uses a URL redirecter, if you click on a URL from a search result, information about the click is sent to CoverUniverse, and CoverUniverse in turn sends you to the site you clicked on.

 **With Whom Does CoverUniverse Share Information?**

CoverUniverse may share information about you with advertisers, business partners, sponsors, and other third parties. However, we only divulge aggregate information about our users and will not share personally identifiable information with any third party without your express consent. For example, we may disclose how frequently the average CoverUniverse user visits CoverUniverse.

By using the CoverUniverse Search Services and our web site, you consent to the collection and use of your information as we have outlined in this policy and to our Terms of Service Policy. CoverUniverse may decide to change this Privacy Policy from time to time.
