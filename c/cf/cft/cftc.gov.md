# Privacy Policy for the CFTC Website

The purpose of this policy statement is to describe how the CFTC handles information which we learn about you when you visit our website. The information we receive depends on how you use the website. You are not required to give us personal information to visit our website. 

If you visit the CFTC website to read or download information, such as press releases or publications, we will collect and store the following information: 

  * the name of the domain (the machine or website) from which you access the Internet (for example, aol.com if you are connecting from an America Online account) and/or the name and Internet Protocol (IP) address of the server you are using to access the CFTC website. 
  * the name and IP address of the CFTC server that received and logged the request. 
  * the date and time the request was received. 
  * the information which you are accessing (for example, which page or image you choose to read or download). 
  * the name and version of the web browser used to access the web page. 



We use the information collected to measure the number of visitors to the different sections of our website and to help us make the website more useful to visitors. 

We do not enable "cookies." A "cookie" is a text file placed on your hard drive by a website that can be used to monitor your use of the site. 

If you complete a form or send a comment or e-mail, you may be choosing to send us information which personally identifies you. This information is used generally to respond to your request but may have other uses _**which are identified on each form.**_ For example, if you send us a comment letter on a proposed regulation, that letter becomes part of the comment file and is available to the public. The comments are used to help CFTC and other members of the public evaluate proposed Commission actions. Other forms which you may choose to submit, such as Freedom of Information Act requests or requests for correction of information, contain information which is used by CFTC employees to track and respond to your request. Information provided on the enforcement questionnaire may be shared with other law enforcement agencies, if appropriate. 

If you have questions about CFTCâ€™s privacy policy and information practices you can e-mail [webmaster@cftc.gov](mailto:webmaster@cftc.gov). 

Information on the Commission's systems of records maintained under the Privacy Act can be found [_under Section D of the CFTC Federal Register Notices._](https://web.archive.org/foia/fedreg99/foiprivacy99.htm)
