At CFOnet we respect your privacy and value your trust. We collect only the information that you voluntarily provide when requesting one of our services such as the email newsletter, participation in our discussion groups or conference information. In addition, we may use "cookies" which simply enable us to create a unique user ID for you when you visit our discussion groups. This saves you from having to re-log in every time you move among different discussion areas. The cookie itself does not contain any personally identifying information. Cookies may also be used by our ad management program for the purpose of tracking the number of times a particular ad has been viewed. 

CFO will not rent, sell or give away your email address or other personal information to any other party, unless otherwise stated and agreed to by you at the time of collection. Please note, however, that CFO Publishing Corporation's circulation department maintains its own list of names and addresses of subscribers to the **print edition** of _CFO_ magazine. Occasionally CFO Publishing Corp. makes this list available to other carefully screened companies or associations whose products or services our magazine subscribers may find of interest. If you are a subscriber to our print edition and would like your name excluded from these mailings, you may send an email to [subscriptions@cfopub.com](mailto:subscriptions@cfopub.com). 

While CFO will seek to require third parties with whom it has agreements to follow appropriate privacy policies, we do not bear any responsibility for any actions or policies of such third parties. If you participate in our discussion groups you should note that when you voluntarily disclose and post personal information within the discussion area, CFO has no control over whether another visitor or third party collects and uses that information. 

Questions or concerns can be directed to us at [web@cfopub.com](mailto:web@cfopub.com).
