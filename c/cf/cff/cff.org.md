All Users are bound by the terms of this privacy policy. CFF is committed to protecting the privacy of our Users.

This privacy policy discloses the privacy practices governing the use of information submitted to CFF through this Site. Capitalized terms shall have the meaning designated in this privacy policy.

**The Information We Collect**

**Anonymous Browsing Information**

You can browse the Site without revealing personal information that can be used to identify you. CFF may collect non-personal information such as your Internet Protocol ("IP") address, the name of the domain you used to access the Internet, the Web site you came from and the site you visit next (see "How We Use It," below). However, CFF does not associate any non-personal information with records containing any personal information submitted to us, so you remain anonymous when you browse the Site.

**Personal Information**

CFF may collect personal information such as names, company names, titles, addresses, telephone numbers, fax numbers, e-mail addresses, and payment information (such as credit card numbers) from Users. For example, CFF may collect personal information submitted through online application and event registration and donation forms.

By submitting personal information to this Site, the User acknowledges that he or she has read this privacy policy, understands it, agrees to its terms and authorizes CFF to collect, use and disclose personal information pursuant to the terms of this privacy policy.

**Cookies**

This Site may use cookies. A cookie is a small file that your Web browser places on your computer's hard drive. It functions as an identification card, recording your passwords, purchases and preferences. Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies. You can set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie, giving you a chance to decide whether or not to accept it.

While CFF may use cookies to track your visit to the Site and our servers automatically log the IP address of your computer, this information does not identify you personally and you remain anonymous, even if you have previously submitted personal information to CFF through the Site or otherwise.

Third parties whose Web sites are accessible through links on the Site may also use their own cookies when you link to their site or service. CFF does not control these third parties' use of cookies and cannot guarantee that they will uphold the same privacy standards as CFF.

CFF expressly disclaims any and all liability related to the collection, use or disclosure of information by third parties. You should review the privacy policies of any third party sites that you visit through a link from the CFF Site to understand how they use cookies and the information they collect through cookies.

**Children**

The Site is not intended for the use of unsupervised children under the age of 13. CFF does not collect personally identifiable information from any person CFF actually knows is under the age of 13.

**How We Use It**

Anonymous browsing information, including your IP address, may be used to gather broad demographic information. This information may be aggregated to measure the number of visits, average time spent, page views and other statistics about Users of the Site. We also may use this data to monitor Site performance and to make the Site easier and more convenient to use.

CFF uses personal information collected from Users, such as names and e-mail addresses, to respond to User inquires, to process User applications for grants or participation in CFF programs, to process User donations, to help organize fund-raising events and to inform Users of new programs and services.

**Who We Share It With**

If you opt-out, you may not be able to participate in or qualify for CFF grants, or fund-raising events or programs, you may not receive the information you requested, and CFF may not be able to inform you of new programs, events, developments, products and services. CFF may share non-personal, non-individual information in aggregate form with third parties.

Notwithstanding other provisions of this privacy policy, we may disclose personal information in special cases when we have found it necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be violating any user agreement or may be causing injury to or interference with CFF, its Users, or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities.

CFF reserves the right to disclose your personal information as explicitly set forth in this privacy policy or any user agreement agreed to by you, or as otherwise required by government or law enforcement officials. CFF can, and you hereby authorize us to, disclose any information to law enforcement or other parties that CFF in its sole discretion, believes is required or appropriate in order to comply with the law.

CFF may assign, sell, license, or otherwise transfer to a third party, your name, address, e-mail address, and any other personal information in connection with an assignment, sale, joint venture, or other transfer or disposition of a portion or all of the assets or stock of CFF or its affiliated entities.

**Direct Mail Privacy Policy**

Any person or organization who makes a financial contribution in response to a Cystic Fibrosis Foundation ("CFF") Direct Mail Program solicitation shall be considered, to the extent permitted hereunder, to be a “Donor” under this privacy policy. CFF and all Donors are bound by the terms of this privacy policy. CFF is committed to protecting the privacy of our Donors.

This privacy policy discloses the privacy practices governing the use of information submitted to CFF through its Direct Mail Program solicitations. Capitalized terms shall have the meaning designated in this privacy policy.

**The Information We Collect**

**Personal Information**

CFF may collect personal information such as names, company names, titles, addresses, telephone numbers, fax numbers, e-mail addresses, and payment information (such as credit card numbers) from Donors. For example, CFF may collect personal information submitted from Donors via return mail or during telephone calls.

CFF may also collect such information by appending from “public records” such as, but not limited to, United States Postal Change of Address (COA) information and local and state government records. The CFF may also append information to its Direct Mail files concerning the Donors’ volunteer activities on behalf of the CFF such as, but not limited to, participation in local chapter fund-raising events.

By submitting personal information to the CFF, Donors acknowledge that they have read this privacy policy, understand it, agree to its terms and authorize CFF to collect, use and disclose personal information pursuant to the terms of this privacy policy.

**Children**

The CFF does not knowingly solicit contributions from individuals under 18 years of age. Because CFF obtains prospective new donor names from such lists as magazine subscribers, which do not append the age of subscribers, it is occasionally unavoidable.

**How We Use It**

The CFF uses personal information collected from Donors, such as names and e-mail addresses, to respond to Donor inquiries, to process Donor requests for information, for issuing donation receipts, to help in deciding who receives future Direct Mail Program solicitations, to process User donations, to help organize fund-raising events, and to inform Donors of new programs and services.

**Who We Share It With**

The CFF does—from time to time—share the names and addresses of its donors with other worthwhile organizations. We do not, however, share telephone numbers, e-mail addresses, or any financial information about any person. This process enables us to introduce thousands of new volunteers to the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation's efforts and provides significant funds to help support our vital research and care programs.

If you do not want us to share your name and address, please contact us by calling  **(866) 347-2345** or **(800) 344-4823** or by sending an e-mail to: [DirectMarketing@cff.org](mailto:DirectMarketing@cff.org). You also may write to us at 6931 Arlington Road, Bethesda, MD 20814,  ATTN: Direct Marketing.

Notwithstanding other provisions of this privacy policy, we may disclose personal information in special cases when we have found it necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be violating any agreement or may be causing injury to or interference with CFF, its Donors, or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities.

The CFF reserves the right to disclose your personal information as explicitly set forth in this privacy policy or any agreement agreed to by you, or as otherwise required by government or law enforcement officials. The CFF can, and you hereby authorize us to, disclose any information to law enforcement or other parties that the CFF in its sole discretion, believes is required or appropriate in order to comply with the law.

**CFF Disclosure Policy**

The CFF does communicate directly to Donors (both new and continuing) to its Direct Mail Program, at least annually, a means for both new and continuing donors to inform CFF that they do not want their names and addresses shared outside the CFF. 

**Applicable Law/International Issues**

Personal information that is submitted to the CFF will be collected, processed, stored, disclosed and disposed of in accordance with applicable U.S. law. If you are a non-U.S. donor, you acknowledge and agree that we may collect and use your personal data and disclose it to other entities, as discussed above in "Who We Share It With," outside your resident jurisdiction.

In addition, such personal information may be stored on servers located outside your resident jurisdiction. U.S. law may not provide the degree of protection for personal information that is available in other countries. By providing us with your personal information, you acknowledge that you have read this privacy policy, understand it, agree to its terms and consent to the transfer of such information outside your resident jurisdiction.

**How to Access, Review  and Update Your Information**

Should your personal information need to be reviewed, updated, corrected or deleted, please submit your changes to Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, 6931 Arlington Road, Bethesda, MD 20814, Attn: Direct Marketing Department, or call toll-free **(866) 347-2345** or **(800) 344-4823**. You also may send an e-mail to [DirectMarketing@cff.org](mailto:DirectMarketing@cff.org).

**Policy Regarding Removing Names from Mailing List**

You may request not to be contacted by the CFF in connection with any solicitations, new services, updates, programs or promotions. Requests not to be contacted by the CFF should be sent to Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, 6931 Arlington Road, Bethesda, MD 20814, Attn: Direct Marketing Department, or call toll-free **(866) 347-2345** or **(800) 344-4823**. You also may send an e-mail to [DirectMarketing@cff.org](mailto:DirectMarketing@cff.org).

It is CFF policy to remove (flag) names from our mailing list immediately upon request. It is important to point out that we legally cannot remove a name (record) from our database if that record contains information concerning donations. The record is marked to receive no other mailings (flagged). 

It is CFF policy not to remove names from our mailing list unless the request to take such action is communicated by Donors or their legal representatives. Requests to take such action by other third parties cannot be honored. 

It is CFF policy to inform Donors requesting that their names be removed from our mailing list that they may contact the Direct Marketing Association (DMA) at **(212) 790-1488** or via the World Wide Web at [www.dmaconsumers.org](http://www.dmaconsumers.org/) to request that their names be placed on the national Pander List.  This list is used by most nonprofit and commercial mailers similar to CFF to take reasonable care not to mail to those persons not wanting to receive any type of solicitation mail.

**Security**

CFF data files have security measures in place to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of information under our control. However, we cannot guarantee that such security measures will be sufficient, will not be breached, and that your personal information may not be disclosed or otherwise accessed in an unauthorized manner. Certain information may be transmitted to you by electronic mail. Although it is illegal to intercept or disclose these messages under Federal law, these transmissions are not secured.

**Direct Mail Privacy Policy Changes**

This privacy policy may be modified. Any changes to the CFF Direct Mail privacy policy will be posted on the CFF Web Site ([www.cff.org](http://www.cff.org/) ). All information submitted through this Site is subject to the terms and conditions of this privacy policy, as it may be amended from time to time.

**How to Contact Us**

If you have any questions about our privacy policy or the information we collect, please write to the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, 6931 Arlington Road, Bethesda, MD 208, Attn: Direct Marketing Department, or call toll-free **(866) 347-2345** or **(800) 344-4823**. You also may send an e-mail to [DirectMarketing@cff.org](mailto:DirectMarketing@cff.org).
