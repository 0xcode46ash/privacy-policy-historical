# PRIVACY POLICY

Thank you for visiting AIMR’s websites and reviewing our Privacy Policy. By using AIMR’s websites ([www.aimr.org](https://web.archive.org/) and  [www.aimrdirect.org](http://www.aimrdirect.org/)) you signify your acceptance of our Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to this policy, please do not use our websites.  Changes will be posted periodically to this Privacy Policy.  We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy from time to time to see if any changes have been posted. 

AIMR is a licensee of the TRUSTe Privacy Program.  

If you have questions or concerns regarding this statement, you should first contact our Information Central department by phone at 1-434-951-5499 or toll free (US & Canada) 1-800-247-8132 or fax at 1-434-951-5262 or e-mail at [info@aimr.org](mailto:info@aimr.org).  If you do not receive acknowledgment of your inquiry or your inquiry has not been satisfactorily addressed, you should then contact TRUSTe <http://www.truste.org/watchdog.html>. TRUSTe will then serve as a liaison with the website to resolve your concerns. 

**OUR COMMITMENT** ****

This Privacy Policy has been developed as an extension of AIMR’s commitment to combine quality products and services with the highest level of integrity in dealing with the public, our Members and candidates and our Member Societies and Chapters.  

**SCOPE**

This Policy guides how AIMR collects, stores and uses information which is collected by AIMR or provided to AIMR, whether through our websites or by other methods such as applications, enrollments, registrations, orders or other means. This Policy covers all of AIMR’s websites, although TRUSTe only covers the collection and dissemination of information on www.aimr.org. This statement does not cover non-AIMR websites that are linked to AIMR websites.  

**AUTOMATIC COLLECTION OF INFORMATION**

If you do nothing during your visit but browse through AIMR’s websites, read pages, or download information, we will gather and store certain information about your visit automatically. This information does not identify you personally. AIMR uses this information to help make our site more useful to visitors, to learn about the number of visitors to our site and to determine the types of technology our visitors use.  We do assign session "cookies" to your computer that allow us to recognize your computer and make your experience more convenient. 

**USE OF INFORMATION**

If you choose to provide us with personal information, such as your name and address, through an order, registering for our programs or other means, AIMR may use that information to provide or offer you products or services, for billing purposes, to send information to you, to respond to you and for other purposes related to the reason you provided the information to AIMR. For example, if you are a candidate or member, AIMR may use the information you provide us to process your application, administer examinations, maintain memberships, send information to you, respond to you and to render services to you.  

AIMR collects information such as your name, address, social security number and telephone numbers. AIMR is committed to protecting the security of your personal information. We use advanced security technologies and procedures to help protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. 

If you choose to provide us with personal information, AIMR may also release your personal information to various organizations. If you do not wish AIMR to release your personal information, please refer to the Opt-out section of our policy.  

These organizations include, but are not limited to: 

  * providers of CFA exam preparatory products and services, who may wish to send you information concerning their products and services 
  * AIMR Member Societies and Chapters, who may send you information about products and services they offer 
  * other companies and organizations that have products or services that we believe may be of interest to you 
  * companies which process your credit card if you order our materials 
  * as required by applicable laws or regulations 



By becoming a Member of AIMR or a candidate in the CFA Program you also allow AIMR to release your personal information to individuals and entities which order the Membership Directory. By becoming a Member of AIMR or a candidate in the CFA Program, you have consented to the release of information related to your candidacy or membership to your employer and certain government agencies. If you apply to become a member or are a member of AIMR’s Member Societies or Chapters you have consented to the release of information related to your membership to the Member Society or Chapter to which you applied.

**USERNAME AND PASSWORD**

If you register for a Candidate or Member Services username and password, AIMR will transmit that information to the companies which administer the AIMR websites to allow you to access those sites.  

**OPTING-OUT OF THE RELEASE OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION**

If you do not wish AIMR to release your personal information to third parties, please send a written request in which you identify yourself, and which clearly states your preference that AIMR not release your information to one or more of the individuals or entities listed above.
