CFA Institute Privacy Policy

CFA Institute is dedicated to protecting your privacy while providing you with the highest level of service. We want you to understand how we gather and protect your information, how we may use that information, and the choices you have. 

**How We Gather Information**

We gather information about you to help us better understand your needs and to provide you with personalized and efficient service. The information we gather comes from information you provide to us (such as your name, address, e-mail address, credit card number, identification numbers, telephone number, education, job description, gender, and age). It also comes from information we gather automatically when you visit our websites such as cookies and other tracking devices which help us to provide a better user experience. 

As a convenience to our users, CFA Institute websites contain links to sites or services created and maintained by other organizations, including member societies. CFA Institute does not control all of these links or sites nor is it responsible for the accuracy, timeliness, security, or even the continued availability or existence of this outside information. Other organizations linked from CFA Institute websites may collect information about you when you visit their sites. CFA Institute cannot control this collection of information. You should contact these companies directly if you have any questions about their use of the information they collect. 

**How We Protect Information**

Keeping your information secure is our responsibility and our commitment to you. If you believe your personal information has been compromised, please [contact us](https://web.archive.org/utility/contact/Pages/index.aspx) immediately. 

We protect your information through physical, electronic, contractual, and procedural measures that comply with United States laws and standards. We require contractors and other companies that provide services on our behalf to protect your information. We prohibit those companies from using it for any other purpose, and we only provide them with information that we believe is necessary to fulfill their responsibilities. 

**How We Use Information**

Your relationship with CFA Institute may dictate how your information will be used. By using any CFA Institute website, providing us with personal information, and/or accessing or enrolling in any of our programs or services, you signify your acceptance of this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to this policy, please do not use our websites or these services. 

  * By becoming a member of CFA Institute or the CIPM Association, you consent to the release of information related to your membership to your employer, member societies, other members, certain government agencies, and the general public. 
  * By becoming a candidate in the CFA Program or CIPM program, you consent to the release of information related to your candidacy to member societies and certain government agencies. 



We may use your information to provide you with the products and services you requested and to inform you about other of our products and services that may be of interest to you. If you choose to provide us with personal information when placing an order, registering for programs, or for other reasons, we may use that information to send information to you, respond to you, or for billing or other related purposes. For example, if you are a candidate or member, CFA Institute may use your information to process your application, administer examinations, maintain memberships, and render services to you. CFA Institute may also release your personal information to various organizations, including but not limited to: 

  * Exam preparatory providers that may send you information about their products and services
