**Our Commitment**   
This privacy policy has been developed as an extension of the CFA Institute commitment to combine quality products and services with the highest level of integrity in dealing with the public, our members and candidates, and our member societies.  

**Scope**   
This policy guides how CFA Institute collects, stores, and uses information that is collected by CFA Institute or provided to CFA Institute, whether through our websites or by other methods, such as applications, enrollments, registrations, orders, or other means. This policy covers all CFA Institute websites. This statement does not cover outside websites that are linked to or from CFA Institute websites.  

**Automatic Collection of Information**   
If you do nothing during your visit but browse through CFA Institute websites, read pages, or download information, we will gather and store certain information about your visit automatically. This information does not identify you personally. CFA Institute uses this information to help make our site more useful to visitors, to learn about the number of visitors to our site, and to determine the types of technology our visitors use.  We do assign session "cookies" to your computer that allow us to recognize your computer and make your experience more convenient. 

Use of Information  
If you choose to provide us with personal information, such as your name and address, when placing an order or registering for our programs or other means, CFA Institute may use that information to provide or offer you products or services, for billing purposes, to send information to you, to respond to you, and for other purposes related to the reason you provided the information to CFA Institute. For example, if you are a candidate or member, CFA Institute may use the information you provide us to process your application, administer examinations, maintain memberships, send information to you, respond to you, and render services to you.  

CFA Institute collects information, such as your name, mailing address, e-mail address, credit card number, social security number, and telephone number. If you are registering in the CFA Program or applying for membership with CFA Institute, we may also collect information about your education, job description, gender, and age. 

CFA Institute is committed to protecting the security of your personal information. We use advanced security technologies and procedures to help protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. 

If you choose to provide us with personal information, CFA Institute may also release your personal information to various organizations. If you do not wish CFA Institute to release your personal information, please refer to the opt-out section of our policy.  

These organizations include, but are not limited to: 

  * Providers of CFA exam preparatory products and services that may send you information concerning their products and services 
  * CFA Institute member societies that may send you information about products and services they offer 
  * Other companies and organizations that have products or services that we believe may be of interest to you 
  * Companies that process your credit card if you order our materials 
  * Others as required by applicable laws or regulations 



By becoming a member of CFA Institute or a candidate in the CFA Program, you have consented to the release of information related to your candidacy or membership to your employer, member societies, and certain government agencies. If you apply to become a member or are a member of CFA Institute member societies, you have consented to the release of information related to your membership to the member society to which you applied.
