In each of the circumstances described below, data specifically required to perform a task you request will be made available to a recipient you designate:

SECURITY MEASURES TO PREVENT MISUSE OF INFORMATION ENTRUSTED TO PATHWAYS OF NORTH CAROLINA   
Pathways of North Carolina causes the data you input to be encrypted when in route between your browser and the Pathways of North Carolina server and when in route between the Pathways of North Carolina server and some other browser or server. This practice helps prevent unauthorized third parties from intercepting and gaining access to your private data during transmission over the Internet. Pathways of North Carolina uses 56-bit, Secure Socket Layer encryption supported by both Netscape's and Microsoft's browsers.

Data residing on the Pathways of North Carolina server is password protected, and access is provided only to the account holder who created the password, anyone to whom that account holder entrusted the password, those employees of Xap who require such access to administer and maintain the Pathways of North Carolina system or to provide requested customer support to users of Pathways of North Carolina, and those employees of UNCGA who require such access to create reports based on aggregated information that is rendered no longer personally identifying in the aggregation process. Each Xap employee who has access to the data residing on the Pathways of North Carolina server has agreed in writing to respect the privacy of all such personal data.

COOKIES

The North Carolina State Education Assistance Authority, through the Program Administrator and other service providers for the Program, has certain nonpublic personal information about Participants and Beneficiaries obtained from various sources. For example, from a Participant's Enrollment Agreement, the Authority knows the Participant's name, address and social security number, and the corresponding information for the Beneficiary of the Account established by the Participant.

The nonpublic personal information the Authority has is protected by physical, electronic and procedural safeguards. The Authority also limits access to all this nonpublic information to persons who need to know that information to perform their Program services.

The Authority may disclose the information collected, as described above, to third parties in order to market jointly and to administer the programs and services that the Program Administrator administers on behalf of the Authority. However, under these circumstances, the Authority will require that the third party, as a condition of its contract with the Authority or the Program Administrator, protect the confidentiality of all nonpublic personal information to the extent required by law and limit its usage to the extent necessary to perform services in connection with the Program. The Authority requires all of these persons to protect the confidentiality of nonpublic personal information about Participants and Beneficiaries.
