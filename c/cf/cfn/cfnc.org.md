In particular, Pathways of North Carolina and XAP Corporation (XAP, the company that operates Pathways of North Carolina) will not give, sell or provide access to your personal information to any company, individual or organization for its use in marketing or commercial solicitation or for any other purpose, except as is necessary for the operation of this site.

There are LIMITED EXCEPTIONS to this Privacy Policy. When required by law to comply with any valid legal process such as a search warrant, subpoena, statute, regulation or court order, XAP will supply such information contained in your Pathways of North Carolina account as that organization reasonably determines, based on the advice of counsel, it is legally required to supply. In addition, XAP may release specific information relevant to special cases, such as a physical threat to you or others or an attempted breach of the security of the Pathways of North Carolina site.

What Personal Identifying Information We Collect  
Pathways of North Carolina collects personal identifying information from you including your name, date of birth, address, e-mail address, telephone number, grade level and additional information that is required by the college and financial aid applications that you choose to fill out. 

Why We Collect Your Personal Identifying Information  
Pathways of North Carolina collects personal information from you for two reasons. The first reason is to enable Pathways of North Carolina to respond to your questions or contact you when necessary in connection with the functioning of Pathways of North Carolina. The second reason is to perform a task, such as filling out a college application, requested by you. Data is requested and collected by Pathways of North Carolina only if it is needed either to enable Pathways of North Carolina to contact you or to perform a function requested by you. When the effective functioning of a Pathways of North Carolina module does not require personal information, none is collected, and those modules can be accessed without opening an account or providing any personal data. 

When you log on to Pathways of North Carolina, your browser will automatically transmit to Pathways of North Carolina's server the IP address of your computer and type of browser you are using. Although your browser transmits the IP address of your computer, Pathways of North Carolina does not associate this IP address with any personally identifiable information regarding you. Pathways of North Carolina does not collect any personally identifiable information other than what users submit and their browsers transmit.

How Your Personal Identifying Information May Be Used

  * Applications for admission   

  * Scholarship Searches   

  * Financial aid applications   

  * Financial aid calculators and estimators   

  * Freshman and transfer planners which can assist you in selecting courses and otherwise planning to meet admission requirements   

  * Requests for information or material from colleges or institutions you specify 

  
   
  
Your personal identifying information may also be used for the following purposes:

  * We may use your identifying information to help diagnose problems with Pathways of North Carolina's server and to administer the Pathways of North Carolina web site.   

  * Summary data representing a compilation of statistical data representative of all Pathways of North Carolina users may be collected by XAP and provided to Pathways of North Carolina, which may provide such data to various colleges and other educational institutions represented on Pathways of North Carolina. NO PERSONAL IDENTIFYING INFORMATION IS MADE AVAILABLE AS PART OF THESE SUMMARY REPORTS. Some examples of summary data are the number of monthly visitors to the site, the number of admission applications submitted over Pathways of North Carolina, and the Pathways of North Carolina functions utilized by students in specified age ranges. 



With Whom Personal Identifying Information May be Shared  
In each of the circumstances described below, data specifically required to perform a task you request will be made available to a recipient you designate:

  * If you submit an application for admission to a college or other educational institution, your personal data required to complete that application will be provided on your behalf to the admissions office of the institution to which you are applying.   

  * If you start an application for admission to a college or other educational institution, your name and other data entered on that application may be provided to the admissions office of that institution, even though you have not yet submitted that application to that institution.   

  * If you request that your data be transferred to FAFSA-on-the-Web to help you fill out your federal financial aid application, data relevant to that application will be provided to a processor specified and authorized to process your financial aid applications (FAFSA) by the U.S. Department of Education.

Pathways of North Carolina uses cookies to remember you and personalize your web-viewing experience by keeping track of your session when logged on to Pathways of North Carolina.

Please recognize that if you delete information, it will no longer be available on Pathways of North Carolina so that, for example, if a college to which you previously submitted an application were to attempt to retrieve that application from Pathways of North Carolina after you made the deletion the deleted information would no longer be accessible. Similarly, when accessed over Pathways of North Carolina information that has been updated or otherwise modified will appear in its then most current form, rather than in the form in which it may have been submitted at some earlier time.
