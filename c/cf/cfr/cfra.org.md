**Privacy Policy**

The Center for Rural Affairs is committed to preserving your privacy and safeguarding your credit card and other sensitive information. The following statement describes the general information-gathering and usage practices of our site.

The Center for Rural Affairs accepts donations using your credit card on our web site. We have partnered exclusively with another nonprofit organization, EGRANTS.ORG, [http://www.egrants.org](http://www.egrants.org/),  for the processing of your donation. Egrants is part of the Tides Foundation, [http://www.tides.org](http://www.tides.org/), who we have worked with for over 20 years. We know Egrants will provide a stable, trustworthy service to our donors. For further details about their privacy practices, please consult their privacy and security policy directly at [http://www.egrants.org/privacy](http://www.egrants.org/privacypolicy.html).

The Center for Rural Affairs does not sell the names or personal data that we collect on our website nor do we maintain any credit card information. Rarely we may share names and addresses of people on our database for the exclusive, one-time, non-commercial use by another non profit organization whose mission is consistent with ours. You have the option to make your donation anonymously. If you choose this option, the Center for Rural Affairs does not receive any of your contact information.

When you make a donation to us through the _Donate Now!_ button on our website, eGrants shares your contact information (name, address, and email address) with us. The Center for Rural Affairs will enter your personal information into our database of donors here in Walthill in order to send you our newsletter, and to keep you abreast of our future work and related issues that may be of interest to you. In October/November of each year we ask our donors to renew their interest in donating to us and to continue to receive the newsletter. If you do not want to receive materials from us, you can call (402) 846-5428 or email us at [customerservice@cfra.org](mailto:customerservice@cfra.org).

We encourage you to view their privacy policies as well. Any information you share with these websites is subject to their policies and practices and is independent of the Center for Rural Affairs.
