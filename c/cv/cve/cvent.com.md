Not only does Cvent strive to collect, use, and disclose personally identifiable information (Personal Information) in a manner consistent with the laws of the countries in which it does business, but it also has a tradition of upholding the highest ethical standards in its business practices. Cvent abides by the Safe Harbor Principles developed by the U.S. Department of Commerce and the European Commission.

This Privacy Policy sets forth the privacy principles that Cvent follows with respect to collection, usage and transfer of Personal Information anywhere in the world, including transfers from the European Union (EU) to the United States.

### Our Service

#### Notice
