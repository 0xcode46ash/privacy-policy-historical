## Notice

Cvent will not disclose or share Personal Information collected on its web site with any third party, except as required by law and/or pursuant to a governmental request, or as necessary to provide services to support its software solutions. For example, Cvent may pass Personal Information to Cvent business partners necessary to process online/ecommerce payments and travel related reservations.

Aggregated User Data does not include any Personal Information about users and is aggregated for the purposes of determining successful application benchmarks and other similar activities.

Event Registration. Cvent customers may invite guests to register for events created in the Cvent application. If a user/guest chooses to register for an event and provides Personal Information during registration, that information is transferred to the event Planner and event Planner’s organization. Similarly, survey responses submitted will be presented to Planner after submission. Any information collected by Cvent on behalf of a customer is owned in its entirety by the customer.

IP Addresses. Cvent may use user IP addresses to diagnose problems with Cvent servers and to administer the Cvent application.

## Cookies

Definition. A cookie is a small data file placed in a user’s web browser or written to a user’s hard drive when a website is accessed. A “session” cookie lasts for a single browser session only and is deleted when the user closes the web browser. A “persistent” cookie remains on the user’s device (even while powered off) until it expires or is deleted. A persistent cookie will be reactivated when a user returns to the website which posted the cookie. Cookies cannot read or access other cookies or any data from a user’s hard drive. Cookies alone will not personally identify a user, however a cookie may recognize a user’s individual web browser or device through an IP Address, browser version, operating system and other information, and website users who log in to their Cvent accounts may be individually identifiable to particular Cvent applications using session cookies. 

Use. Cvent uses cookies to improve user experience, monitor website usage and gather information which helps Cvent improve the site content and applications. For example, cookies are used to distinguish between and authenticate users, save usernames and login status (so that users don’t have to log in more than once each time they access secured portions of the site), keep track of user-specific settings such as language, layout and other preferences, and manage session information to minimize data entry and for general ease of use. Cookies are also used to "time-out" user sessions that are idle for an extended period of time. Cvent may also use cookies to gather statistical and other information about how the website is used, assess the effectiveness of advertising, monitor access and use of particular content and provide tailored advertising and other content to users. Using cookies in the foregoing manner makes the website more effective, easier to use, improves security and efficiency, and is essential for the continuous improvement of Cvent’s systems. Consequently, accepting these cookies is necessary for many uses of the website and blocking or restricting cookies may limit a user’s ability to access certain website content and functionality.

Blocking/Restricting Cookies. Users may set their web browsers to restrict or to entirely block cookies, to configure cookie notification settings and/or to delete cookies already present on the browser or device. Information on how to do this should be provided in the web browser’s help/reference section. Users who block cookies may be able to access the Cvent website but will not be able to use most of the content, applications and services Cvent makes available on the website. Limiting or restricting certain types of cookies may prevent a user from using certain portions of the Cvent website, depending on how the browser settings are configured. For example, event registration cannot be completed successfully if cookies are disabled in a user’s web browser.

## Choice

Cvent users may choose whether or not to submit Personal Information while using Cvent’s services. In some cases, Cvent’s customers require Personal Information from their guests. In such cases, choosing to withhold Personal Information, may limit a user’s ability to use all of Cvent’s services.

## Security

Cvent has security measures in place to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of information under its control. Cvent protects secure data with industry-standard firewall and password protection systems. Cvent periodically reviews and improves its security and privacy policies as necessary. Only pre-authorized individuals have access to Cvent servers and information provided by its users.

## Data Integrity

Cvent will use Personal Information only in ways that are compatible with the purposes for which it was collected or subsequently authorized by the individual. Reasonable steps will be taken to ensure that Personal Information is relevant accurate, complete and current, to its intended use.

## Access and Correction

Cvent users may change or modify previously submitted Personal Information by (i) using the User Profile Manager within the "My Account" section of the Cvent application or (ii) sending an email request to [customercare@cvent.com](mailto:customercare@cvent.com).

Please note that no data transmission over the Internet is infallible. Any information transmitted through the Cvent application is done at the user’s own risk. Once Cvent receives the information, it will take every reasonable precaution to ensure its security.

## Enforcement

Cvent will conduct compliance audits of its relevant privacy practices to verify adherence to this Privacy Policy and the US Department of Commerce Safe Harbor Principles. Any employee that Cvent determines is in violation of this Privacy Policy will be subject to disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment.

## Supplier Network

When a Cvent user submits an RFP to a property or service provider listed on the Supplier Network, Cvent will contact the applicable supplier and disclose information necessary to submit the RFP, which may contain Personal Information. Cvent suppliers will not have access to the Cvent user's address book or information collected through the Cvent Event or Survey Products.
