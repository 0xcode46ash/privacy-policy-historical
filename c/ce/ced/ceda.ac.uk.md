## Cookies

When we provide services, we want to make them easy, useful and reliable. This sometimes involves placing small amounts of information on your device, for example, computer or mobile phone. These include small files known as cookies. They cannot be used to identify you personally.

These pieces of information are used to improve services for you through, for example:

  * enabling a service to recognise your device so you don`t have to give the same information during one task,
  * recognising that you have already given a username and password so you don`t need to enter it for every web page requested,
  * measuring how many people are using services, so they can be made easier to use and that there is enough capacity to ensure they are fast.
