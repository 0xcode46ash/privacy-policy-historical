# Trillian - Privacy Policy

### 1\. Scope

This privacy policy applies to data collected by Cerulean Studios ("Cerulean") through its websites that link to this privacy policy, the Trillian software ("Trillian"), and other software and services that may be provided by Cerulean Studios from time to time (together with Trillian, the "Cerulean Services").

This privacy policy does not apply to information collected by websites, software, services, plugins, or features provided by third parties (the "Third Party Services") and accessible through the Cerulean Services or otherwise. Please contact the providers of the Third Party Services if you have questions about their privacy policies.

### 2\. The Information We Collect

### 2.1. Your Trillian Credentials

In order to access the Cerulean Services, Cerulean requires that you create a unique username (your "Trillian Username") and password (your "Trillian Password", together with your Trillian Username, your "Trillian Credentials"). In association with your Trillian Credentials, we will store any demographic or other information (for example, your gender and age) you choose to provide to us for the purpose of creating a user profile ("User Profile Information"). We may display the User Profile Information that you choose to provide to us when you authorize us to publish it in a public user directory or when you request permission to communicate with other Trillian customers.

### 2.2. Your Billing Information

If you elect to purchase a paid Trillian service such as Trillian Pro, you may choose to pay with your credit card or PayPal account. All information sent to Cerulean during the purchasing process will be protected with the Transport Layer Security ("TLS") protocol. In the event that you use PayPal, you will be sent directly to PayPal's servers to complete your transaction. When you purchase a paid Trillian service, your name and details about the product you purchased are stored on our servers. We do not store your credit card information on our servers.

### 2.3. Instant Messenger Usernames And Passwords

At your option, you may request that Cerulean stores certain third-party network account information (encrypted usernames and passwords) on its servers ("Encrypted Third-Party Account Information"). This encrypted information is only accessible by you and cannot be read by third parties, including Cerulean Studios employees. If you choose to disable the storage of Encrypted Third-Party Account Information, Encrypted Third-Party Account Information will only be stored on the device(s) on which Trillian is installed.

### 2.4. Instant Messenger Contact Lists

Your contact list (including any groups you've created, notes you've taken, metacontacts, and display names) is stored on Cerulean's servers. By storing your contact list, we are able to synchronize it between devices in realtime as well as provision new devices with your contact list should a local copy not exist yet. Your contact list is only available to the Trillian Username that uploads it.

#### 2.5. Instant Messenger Conversations

Certain Trillian software will offer you the option to upload your conversation logs to Cerulean's servers so that you can access your logs using Trillian software on multiple devices or platforms. Conversation logs are not encrypted. The transmission of conversation logs to and from our servers is protected with industry standard encryption, such as TLS. Conversation logs that are uploaded to our servers are only available to the Trillian Username that uploads them. Cerulean makes no warranty regarding the availability of conversation logs uploaded to our servers. You are solely responsible for the content of your conversation logs.

Versions of Trillian that operate on mobile devices operate by establishing connections to Cerulean Studios' servers. In order to provide services through mobile versions of Trillian, Cerulean Studios may temporarily store recent instant messenger session information and conversations ("User Messaging Information"). This information is stored only for the purpose of transmitting the information back to you (e.g., to reliably deliver messages to a mobile device that temporarily loses internet connectivity, or to provide you with a reminder excerpt of your last conversation) and is not permanently archived unless requested by you as a part of the conversation logging feature. The User Messaging Information is only available to the Trillian Username associated with it.

Certain versions of Trillian support many-to-many group chats. Group chat conversation logs are stored on Cerulean Studios' servers to ensure that all participants of a group chat have access to its conversation logs. Group chat conversation logs are not encrypted. The transmission of group chat conversation logs to and from our servers is protected with industry standard encryption, such as TLS. Group chat conversation logs that are uploaded to our servers are only available to the Trillian Usernames that belong to the group chat in question and as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy. Cerulean makes no warranty regarding the availability of group chat conversation logs uploaded to our servers. You are solely responsible for the content of your group chat conversation logs.

Trillian will not otherwise transmit, store, or access the content of your conversations, except as required in order to comply with law, rule or regulation.

#### 2.6. Shared Images

Certain Trillian software will offer you the option to upload images you send to other users to Cerulean's servers so that you can access these images on multiple devices or platforms. Images that are uploaded to our servers are made available in the form of a URL that you can transmit to other users for viewing. Any person with the URL for an image that you have uploaded will be able to access the image. You are solely responsible for limiting distribution of the URL for an image to intended viewers. You can delete the images you upload in this manner using the account tools available on our website. Cerulean makes no warranty regarding the availability of images uploaded to our servers. You are solely responsible for the content of your images, and will not upload images that infringe or violate someone else's rights or otherwise violate the law.

By providing the Third-Party Account Information to us and accessing and using the Cerulean Services, you authorize us to share the Third-Party Account Information with the relevant third-party communications network provider solely for the purpose of establishing and authenticating your session.

You may opt out of promotional mailings and surveys from us by disabling receipt of these items in your user account preferences.

### 3.4. Disclosure Of Your Information To Others

Cerulean may hire other companies to provide limited services on its behalf, such as handling the processing and delivery of mailings, hosting websites, processing transactions, or performing statistical analysis of Cerulean Services. Those service providers will be permitted to obtain only the information they need to deliver such services, are required to maintain the confidentiality of the information, and are prohibited from using it for any other purpose. Additionally, for credit card processing, our fraud detection vendors may use aggregate data to improve their ability to detect fraudulent uses of credit cards.

Cerulean may access or disclose information about you, including the content of your communications, in order to: (a) comply with the law or respond to lawful requests or legal process; (b) protect the rights or property of Cerulean or our customers, including the enforcement of our agreements or policies governing your use of the Cerulean Services; or (c) act on a good faith belief that such access or disclosure is necessary to protect the personal safety of Cerulean employees, customers or the public.

In the event that Cerulean is acquired by or merges with another company or transfers substantially all of its assets to another company, Cerulean may transfer all of its user information and data, including information about you (including personally identifiable information), to that other company.

Except as described in this privacy policy, Cerulean will not disclose your information to third parties without your consent. Cerulean does not sell, lease, or rent your email address or contact information to third parties for marketing purposes.
