# Our Philosophy

CERVÉLO PRIVACY POLICY
Our Philosophy
Cervélo Cycles Inc. (“Cervélo”) believes that having a relationship with our customers that is
founded on trust is not merely the law but also good business. We believe in giving full
disclosure about the kinds of information we gather and what we do with it. We are committed to
ensuring that your privacy is protected.
Cervélo is committed to protecting any personal information we collect. To this end, we have
prepared this Privacy Policy to inform you about our ongoing commitment to ensuring your
personal information remains accurate, confidential and used only for identified purposes,
regardless of how it is provided to us. This Policy also addresses how you can inquire about the
personal information we hold about you and how we will respond to such a request.
Your Privacy Rights
As of January 1st , 2004, all private companies engaged in commercial activities must comply
with the Personal Information Protection & Electronic Documents Act (“the Act”), unless federal
cabinet has exempted the organization because it is subject to “substantially similar” provincial
legislation.
We are responsible for the personal information we collect, use, maintain and disclose. To ensure
this accountability, we have developed this policy, and have provided training to our managers
and support staff on how to properly implement our privacy policies and practices .
What is “Personal Information?”
Personal information is any information that identifies you, or by which your identity could be
deducted. It does not include:
•   the name or business address or telephone number of an employee of an organization;
•   corporate business contact information; and
•   aggregated information that is no longer related to a specific identifiable individual.
Cervélo reserves the right to use aggregated or anonymous information in any way it considers
appropriate.
Why Do We Collect Personal Information from You?
We collect personal information to
•   understand your needs when you are shopping for a high- performance bicycle;
•   help us develop better, faster, and more efficient racing bikes based on your valuable input;
•   track and identify market trends;
•   determine the credit-worthiness of a business or individual;
•   provide information to you about new bikes and products; and
•   inform you of exciting upcoming events.


CERVÉLO PRIVACY POLICY
Collecting your personal information helps us build better bikes and provide you with
unparalleled service and support. We may at times collect sensitive financial, family, and
personal preference information from you, which helps us to better understand our market.
Having such information help us to design bikes that meets the needs of different market sectors,
which in turn will result in cost savings to you, the consumer.
At times Cervélo may require certain financial information to determine your credit- worthiness
as a distributor or as an applicant for credit. If you choose not to provide us with certain personal
information required for a product or service, such as to complete a purchase order or process an
application for credit we will advise you if the transaction cannot be completed without your
personal information.
What Personal Information Do We Gather?
The kind of personal information we will ask for includes your name, e- mail address, phone
number, address, type of business, customer preference information, customer number, as well as
such other personal information that is needed to fulfill the purposes identified in this Privacy

When you apply for credit, Cervélo may ask you for financial info rmation, which includes but is

•   trade references;
•   bank account and contact information; and,
•   copies of recent balance sheets and income statements.
We also ask you for your Social Insurance Number (“SIN”) as part of our application for credit.
You may provide us with your SIN at your option and it is not required as a condition of
obtaining credit with Cervélo. The SIN merely helps us establish your identity with greater
accuracy when conducting a credit bureau analysis. Providing your SIN to us is entirely optional
and you have the right to refuse to provide it to us. You should know that most applications for
credit have an impact on your credit rating as reported by a credit bureau.

In collecting your personal information, we continuously strive to be in full compliance with the
Act and otherwise conduct our information collection with utmost care and concern for your
privacy. We may collect personal information directly from you when you purchase one of our
products, apply for credit, or in the course of our dealings with you. We may ask you to fill out
