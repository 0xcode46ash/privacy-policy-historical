**_Privacy Policy_** Cellular Factory, a subsidary of Cellit, respects your interest in privacy and pledges to keep your confidential information private and secure. We exercise security precautions to prevent any misuse of your information and any intrusion into your privacy. 

When you place an order at Cellit, we must collect certain private information equivalent to what you would otherwise give over the telephone or to a retail clerk. This information includes your name, address, email address, credit card number and credit card expiration date. 

Cellit uses this private information responsibly for the limited purposes of: securing credit authorization to process your order. Cellit will disclose only the information necessary to process the order and to ship your products. Cellit will not sell, exchange or otherwise distribute your information for advertising or promotional purposes.

Cellit uses SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) authentication to secure your information from interception by any third party. Private interactions between your browser and the Cellit server are encrypted up to 128-bit encryption, which can be unlocked by only Cellit. We use SSL authentication for credit card authorization and settlement as well, so your vitally private credit card information is scrambled until decoded by only an authorized party.

After acceptance of your order, Cellit does not store your credit card number for another transaction. Your other personal information is stored on Cellitâ€™s secure network. This network is protected by multiple layers of security such as physical security (under lock and key) and access control lists. 

Despite our efforts to protect and secure your private information, if you feel more secure ordering by telephone, please call a Cellit Customer Service Representative at 626.330.0202, who will take your order in strict confidence.
