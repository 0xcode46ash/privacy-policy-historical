# Privacy Policy | CST Cell Signaling Technology

Respect for the privacy of your personal information is extremely important to CST. We are committed to strictly adhering to this Privacy Policy and being compliant with all applicable laws. Except as provided below, CST will not share your personally identifiable information with third parties unless you have consented to the disclosure. This Privacy Policy covers all instances where we may collect, use, maintain, and secure personal information that you provide to us on this website or mobile application (“Site”).

## Information Collection

On this Site, you may be asked to provide personally identifiable information (“PII”) to CST. PII means information that can identify or locate you, like your name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, and other similar information. If you provide PII to CST, we may enhance or merge it with information about you that we obtain from third parties. When you use this Site and provide your PII to CST, you consent to CST’s use of such information as described in this Privacy Policy.

CST may use your PII in the following ways:

  * To respond to your requests for information, products, or services;
  * To administer your account if you have registered on the Site;
  * To inform you about our products and services;
  * For legal compliance, such as to enforce our legal rights, to comply in good faith with applicable laws, and to protect Site users;
  * If you apply for a job via this Site, to consider you for employment; and
  * For other general business purposes, such as website management, marketing, advertising, and research and development.



This Site may also collect information that does not identify you personally ("Non-PII”). Such Non-PII includes non-personally-identifiable information that you choose to provide or post on this Site. Non-PII collected by this Site may also include information gathered through cookies and pixel tags as described below.

Cookies are small bits of information that this Site places on your computer. Pixel tags, also called web beacons or single-pixel gifs, allow this Site to collect web log information. A pixel tag is a graphic on a web page or in an e-mail message designed to track pages viewed or messages opened. CST and our service providers may use cookies and pixel tags to identify your IP address, browser type, domain name, and specific web pages through which you click. CST uses such Non-PII to administer and update our Sites and for other everyday business purposes. We reserve the right to maintain, update, disclose or otherwise use Non-PII without limitation.

When you visit this Site, a third party ratings and reviews service provider called Bazaarvoice may place its persistent cookie on your computer. Bazaarvoice’s use of any data collected through its cookies is subject to the [Bazaarvoice Privacy Policy](http://www.bazaarvoice.com/privacy-policy/), and is reflected in its [Service Descriptions](http://www.bazaarvoice.com/legal/servicedescriptions/).

Most web browsers allow you to erase cookies on your computer, block cookies from your computer, or notify you when a cookie is stored on your computer. Please prefer to your browser’s instructions on these functions. If you choose to disable cookies, please note that you may not be able to take advantage of all of the Site's features.

## Information Sharing

Except as provided below, CST will not share PII with third parties unless you have consented to the disclosure.

In certain circumstances, CST may share your PII with service providers who need access to your information to provide operational or other support services to CST such as email messaging, data management, database hosting, credit card processing, or shipping services. To ensure the confidentiality and security of your PII, such service providers must agree to safeguard your information. These service providers are also restricted by contract from using your PII in any way other than to provide services for CST.

CST also may provide information to government entities and others when we believe in good faith that such disclosure is required by law. We may also access or disclose your information in order to protect the legal rights of CST, its employees and/or agents; to protect the safety and security of users and members; and to help prevent fraud.

CST may also provide PII and Non-PII to a third party in connection with the sale, assignment, or other transfer of this Site. In such event, CST will require any such buyer to agree to treat PII in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

CST respects your email marketing preferences. You can request removal from our contact list by sending a request to us at [info@cellsignal.com](mailto:info@cellsignal.com) or CST Contact List Request, Attention: Marketing Preferences, 3 Trask Lane, Danvers, MA 01923.

## Data Security

CST protects PII with reasonable and appropriate physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards. For example, the sections of this Site that collect sensitive PII use industry-standard secure socket layer encryption (SSL). To take advantage of this SSL, your browser must support encryption protection (found in Internet Explorer release 3.0 and above).

## Links to Third Party Sites

This Site may contain links to a number of sites owned and operated by third parties that we believe may offer useful information. The policies and procedures described in this Privacy Policy do not apply to those third party sites. Please contact those third party sites for information on their data collection, security, and distribution policies.

Please check this Privacy Policy periodically for changes. If we make any material changes, we will notify you by email (sent to the e-mail address specified in your account) or by means of a notice on this Site prior to the effective date of the change.
