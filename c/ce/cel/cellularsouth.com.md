### PRIVACY POLICY

This Privacy Policy does not apply to other websites, third party application providers or to the Internet generally. C Spire may make content or services from other websites available to you from links located on our Websites. C Spire is not responsible for the privacy, security, or content of such sites. C Spire also uses third parties to advertise its products and services on the Internet and websites owned by parties that are unaffiliated with C Spire. You should review the privacy policy of each application provider you use and at any third party web site you visit to determine how that provider or site protects your privacy.

**PERSONAL INFORMATION**

C Spire collects personal information concerning its customers at the time they sign up for C Spire service. C Spire collects additional personal information from its customers and users of the Websites in connection with registration on the Websites, additional product and service orders, your use of the C Spire network, downloads from the Websites, uploads to the Websites, contests, surveys and special offers. Personal information collected by C Spire may include, but is not limited to, your name, address, email address, telephone number, billing, payment, usage, credit and transaction information (including credit card numbers, account numbers, and/or social security numbers), and demographic information.

Ordering online products and services from C Spire is limited to adults (eighteen (18) years of age or older or as otherwise legally defined).

C Spire takes precautions to protect your personal information against unauthorized disclosure, theft and misuse. However, when you use third party applications or some portions of the Websites such as the forums and social networking services, any personal information you share is visible to other users and C Spire cannot protect it. You are responsible for the protection of the personal information you choose to share on third party applications or open portions of the Websites. Please be careful when doing so.

**NON-PERSONAL INFORMATION**

In addition to and sometimes in connection with the collection of personal information, C Spire also collects non-personal information - information collected in a form that does not reflect or reference anything directly identifiable with you or any other specific individual. Non-personal information collected by C Spire may include occupation, language, ZIP code, area code, location, Internet activity and time zone. C Spire uses this information to increase its understanding of customer behavior and better serve its customers. In cases where non-personal information is collected with personal information so that it can be connected to a specific individual, C Spire will treat the non-personal information as personal information as long as it is combined, and C Spire will remove any links between the non-personal and personal information before treating the separated information as non-personal information.

**LOCATION BASED SERVICES**

C Spire may provide location-based services or provide third parties with access to your location information so that such services may be provided to you.

C Spire's provision of location-based services or disclosure of your location to third parties, including in connection with third party applications, will be subject to your consent where appropriate. For instance, with your authorization, we may provide location-based services or provide location information to third parties in connection applications, including third-party applications, that you may use or download. You should carefully review the terms and conditions applicable to such applications and the privacy policies of any third-parties to whom you provide your consent to use location information, because when you use such third-party services their terms of use and privacy policies will govern.
