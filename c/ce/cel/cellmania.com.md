Some of our customers have requested that we minimize the amount of data entry and the number of times they have to enter their username and password. As part of solving this problem for our customers, we keep track of the IP address of the client machine and the username of the customer. We also keep an encrypted copy of the customer's password and use a timeout mechanism to ensure that someone else cannot login to the site as you, if you have left your machine unlocked for a long time. For greater security, we provide a "logout" button, which you can use to immediately logout of your session on our Web site. You should use the logout option and exit out of the browser, if you are using our site from a "kiosk" location, where multiple people may be using the same machine for short periods of time.
