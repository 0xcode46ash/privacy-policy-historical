Cellebrite has long recognized that individuals with whom we conduct business value their privacy. However, in order to conduct global business in this increasingly electronic economy, the collection of personal information is often necessary and desirable. It is Cellebrite's goal to balance the benefits of e-commerce with the right of individuals to prevent the misuse of their personal information. 

The Collection of Personal Information   
In some circumstances, Cellebrite may request personal information from you, like your name, e-mail address, company name or telephone number. Your response to these inquiries is strictly voluntary. Cellebrite uses this information to customize your experience on our website. In addition, Cellebrite may use this information for other business purposes, such as to alerting you to products and services that can assist you in your business, promoting site registration, and assisting in order processing.   
In general, you can visit our site without divulging any personal information. However, there are areas of this site that require this information to complete their customization functions, and may not be available to those choosing not to reveal the information requested. 

Collecting Domain Information   
Cellebrite also collects domain information as part of its analysis of the use of this site. This data enables us to become more familiar with which customers visit our site, how often they visit and what parts of the site they visit most often. Cellebrite uses this information to improve its web-based offerings. This information is collected automatically and requires no action on your part.
