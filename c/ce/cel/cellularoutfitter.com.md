CellularOutfitter.com uses customer information only for the purposes of processing and fulfilling orders, contacting purchasers to inform them of their order status, sending opt-in promotional information (which is sent directly by CellularOutfitter.com), and enhancing the user experience. We partner with other third parties to provide intermediary services. For example, we use an outside shipping company (the United States Postal Service) to ship orders, and a credit card processing company to bill users for goods and services. These companies do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes. When the user purchases our products or services, we share names, or other contact information including billing and shipping address necessary for the third party to provide these services.

The CellularOutfitter.com shopping cart is structured around a secure Yahoo! Store checkout platform. Any information provided on our checkout page is collected by Yahoo! Store on their servers from Customers who purchase merchandise from our site. That information is then shared with CellularOutfitter.com.

CellularOutfitter.com stores information that is collected through cookies to create a profile of our user. A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's computer tied to information about the user. CellularOutfitter.com uses session ID cookies to create and identify user profiles. For the session ID cookie, once users close the browser, the cookie simply terminates. By setting a cookie on our site, users would not have to log in a password more than once, thereby saving time while shopping on our site. Only CellularOutfitter.com can access a cookie that we place. A profile is stored information that we keep on individual users that is tied to the users personally identifiable information to provide offers and improve the content of the site for the user. This profile is used to tailor a user’s visit to our Web site, and to direct pertinent marketing promotions to them. We DO NOT share your profile with other third parties. Some of our business partners (e.g., advertisers) use cookies on our site. We have no access to or control over these cookies. This privacy statement covers the use of cookies by CellularOutfitter.com only and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers. This Web site contains links to other sites that are not owned or controlled by CellularOutfitter.com. Please be aware that we, CellularOutfitter.com, are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. 

We encourage you to be aware when you leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every Web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies only to information collected by this Web site. 

CellularOutfitter.com Web pages contain web analytics beacons (called a "single-pixel gif" or "Web beacon") to compile anonymous, aggregated statistics about our Web site usage. Web analytics beacons are traffic and e-commerce analysis services which enables us to better manage the merchandising on our site by informing us of what areas and product categories are in demand by our customers. Web beacons are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. Similarly, the code gathers data through the use of a persistent cookie. Cookies assist us in tracking which of our features you like best. And when visitors re-visit our site, cookies can enable us to customize our content according to visitor preferences. However, both the Web beacons and cookies are not tied to users' personally identifiable information. These cookies expire once you leave the CellularOutfitter.com site (including CellularOutfitter.com third-party partner affiliate sites for cell phones and downloads). 

The importance of security for all transactional information associated with our customers is of utmost concern to us. The ordering information you provide - including credit card information - is secured using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption technology via Yahoo! Store servers. Yahoo! Store uses SSL (Secure Socket Layer) encryption when transmitting certain kinds of information, such as financial services information or payment information. An icon resembling a padlock is displayed on the bottom of most browsers window during SSL transactions that involve credit cards and other forms of payment. Any time a Yahoo! Store asks for a credit card number during checkout for payment, it will be SSL encrypted. The information you provide will be stored securely on Yahoo!’s servers. This SSL technology is used to prevent such information from being intercepted and read as it is transmitted over the Internet. The encrypted data goes to a secure site where your information is stored on restricted-access computers located at restricted-access sites. While Yahoo! makes every effort to ensure the integrity and security of its network and systems, they cannot guarantee that their security measures will prevent third-party "hackers" from illegally obtaining this information. 

We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. If you have any questions about security on our Web site, you can send email us at [webmaster@cellularoutfitter.com](mailto:webmaster@CellularOutfitter.com). 

CellularOutfitter.com will remain committed to protecting your privacy online. We may change our Privacy Policy from time to time. When such a change is made, we will post the revised Privacy policy on our website so please bookmark this page and check back periodically. If, however, we are going to use users’ personally identifiable information in a manner materially different from that stated at the time of collection we will notify users and customers via email and by posting an immediate notice on our Web site for at least 30 days.
