As with all shopping websites, we collect personal information from you when you shop online at www.celticandco.com

We use this information to make your shopping experience as easy and enjoyable as possible. We need it to process your order, inform you of any delays or problems and occasionally to send you special offers and promotions.

We occasionally make our mailing list available to carefully selected companies whose products might be of interest to you. If you prefer that we do not include you on these mailing lists, please email us at [customercare@celticandco.com](mailto:customercare@celticandco.com).

The encryption technique we use is the highest standard available for e-commerce and certified by Thawte, part of the Verisign group - the world's most respected certification body for Internet firms. If you have questions regarding our credit card security policies, please call us on 0 33 34 00 00 44.
