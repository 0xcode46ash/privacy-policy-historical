# Privacy Policy - The Informr

**Last updated: November 30, 2015**

Your privacy is something we take seriously. Here at The Informr (ten24 Media Inc.) we have a few fundamental principles:

\- We don’t ask you for personal information unless we truly need it. _(We can’t stand services that ask you for things like your gender or income level for no apparent reason)_

\- We don’t share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop our products, or protect our rights.

\- We don’t store personal information on our servers unless required for the on-going operation of one of our services. Below is our privacy policy which incorporates these goals.

### In Short

We collect anonymous statistics about your visit, like which of our pages you viewed. If you use some 3rd party services like Google or Facebook, they may know you visited this website. We can’t control how they use this data but we don’t believe this knowledge poses any threat to you.

If you sign up with us we take great care to keep your information safe and we’ll never share it with others without your express permission.

We never share your data with 3rd parties except to help us deliver our own services.

These are just the key points. If you need detail, keep reading.

### Website Visitors

Like most website operators, ten24 Media Inc. collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. ten24 Media Inc.'s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how visitors use our websites. From time to time, ten24 Media Inc. may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its websites.

ten24 Media Inc. also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on our websites (ie. theinformr.com). ten24 Media Inc. only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below, except that blog commenter IP addresses are visible and disclosed to the administrators of the blog where the comment was left.

### Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information

Certain visitors to ten24 Media Inc.'s websites choose to interact with the sites in ways that require ten24 Media Inc. to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that ten24 Media Inc. gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for a user account to provide a username and email address. ten24 Media Inc. collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with the site. ten24 Media Inc. does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.

### Measuring our Visitors / Aggregated Statistics

ten24 Media Inc. may collect statistics about the behaviour of visitors to its websites. and may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, ten24 Media Inc. does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.

We measure visitors to our website using Google Analytics. This records what pages you view within our site, how you arrived at our site and some basic information about your computer. All of that information is anonymous – so we don’t know who you are; just that somebody visited our site.

The information we collect from analytics helps us understand what parts of our sites are doing well, how people arrive at our site and so on. Like most websites, we use this information to make our website better.

You can learn more about Google Analytics or opt out if you wish.

### Facebook, Twitter and other social networks

We may use services such as social buttons. To do so we embed code from a third-party that they provide and we do not control ourselves. To function their buttons generally know if you’re logged in; for example Facebook use this to say “x of your friends like this”. We do not have any access to that information, nor can we control how those networks use it. We suggest you check the third party websites for more information about their cookies and how to manage them.

### Emails

We may send you email notifications regarding your account or for other communications you have specifically requested (such as newsletters or notifications when someone replies to one of your comments). You have the ability to opt out of any of this communication at any time.
