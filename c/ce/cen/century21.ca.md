# CENTURY 21 CANADA LIMITED PARTNERSHIP PRIVACY POLICY

                     CENTURY 21 CANADA LIMITED PARTNERSHIP
                                       PRIVACY POLICY
Century 21 Canada Limited Partnership (“CENTURY 21”) recognizes the importance of
protecting the personal information of our Customers, our prospective customers, brokers and
sales people with our franchisees and anyone else from whom we may collect personal
information from time to time whether in the course of real estate transactions or otherwise.
This Privacy Policy discloses the type of personal information we gather from or about you
(“You”), how we may use it, how and to whom we may disclose it, your right to access your
personal information which we have collected and your right to correct or change that
information where You believe it may be inaccurate. At CENTURY 21 we hope to give You as
much control about your personal information as possible.
What We Mean By Personal Information?
Personal information is any information in whatever form about an identifiable individual.
However, it does not include:
1.      your name or information which would enable us to contact You at your place of
        employment including your name, position name or title, business telephone number,
        business address, business email and business fax number;
2.      personal information about You that is publicly available information such as information
        available from a public registry or contained in a telephone book;
3.      aggregated information that cannot be associated with You as a specific individual; and
4.      information which is not about a person but which is about a company, association or
        another organization.
What Personal Information Does CENTURY 21 Collect?
CENTURY 21 collects the following personal information from our Customers:
1.      personal information which You voluntarily provide to us when You open an account or
        subscription on our website (the “Website”);
2.      we may collect photographic images of your property, descriptions of the property and its
        sale price for marketing purposes, but only where we have obtained your prior consent;
        and
3.      personal information relating to your use of the Website (in accordance with our Website
        Privacy Policy set out below).
CENTURY 21 collects the following personal information from brokers and sales people with
our franchisees:
1.      personal information, including photographs, which You provide when You register on
        OnlineOffice. The provision of this personal information is entirely in your control; and
2.      personal information relating to your use of the Website (in accordance with our Website
        Privacy Policy set out below).
Except where we are allowed by law to collect personal information without your knowledge and
consent, we will do so fairly and openly and with your knowledge and consent.


                                                   2
How We Use Your Personal Information
CENTURY 21 uses the personal information of our Customers for the following purposes:
1.      to put You in touch with a broker or sales person with one of our franchisees who may
        contact You to assist You with listing property for sale or purchasing property;
2.      to assist the broker or sales person in finding appropriate property for You;
3.      unless You choose to opt-out, CENTURY 21 may use information about your home in
        marketing material (we will not use your name), and may use your contact information to
        promote and market additional services, products and special offers from CENTURY 21;
        and
4.      for the purposes relating to use of personal information collected on the Website set out
        below in our Website Privacy Policy.
Why We Disclose Your Personal Information
1.      CENTURY 21 may share Customer personal information with third parties engaged to
        assist us in providing services or products to You or to carry out one or more of the
        purposes described above. These service providers are prohibited from using personal
        information for any purpose other than to provide this assistance and are required to
        protect personal information disclosed to them by us and to comply with the general
        privacy principles described in this Privacy Policy.
2.      CENTURY 21 discloses Customer personal information when it makes the personal
        information a Customer has provided online available to its franchisees and their brokers
        and sales people.
3.      CENTURY 21 discloses broker and sales person personal information when it makes the
        personal information which the broker or sales person has provided available for
        Customers to access online when a broker or sales person sets up OnlineOffice.
4.      CENTURY 21 may disclose personal information gathered on the Website for the
        purposes set out below in our Website Privacy Policy.
CENTURY 21 reserves the right to collect, use and disclose other personal information where
we are required or allowed to by law, including appropriate personal information protection
legislation without your knowledge or your consent.
Consent
Except where required or permitted to do so without your consent, CENTURY 21 only collects
your personal information with your consent. In most cases, CENTURY 21 relies on express
consent. However, where the purpose of the collection of personal information is obvious on its
face, CENTURY 21 may rely on your implied consent.
In some cases, such as using your personal information for marketing our or other services to
You, CENTURY 21 will rely on opt-out consent. (You will receive the information unless You
advise us You do not wish to receive it.)
CENTURY 21 only collects personal information where it is necessary to provide the service
which You are seeking and which we have agreed to provide. We do not use deceptive or
misleading practises to obtain your consent.


                                                   3
CENTURY 21 does not require You to consent to the collection, use or disclosure of personal
information as a condition of the supply of a service by us unless such collection, use or
disclosure is required to fulfill the aforementioned purposes of collection.
CENTURY 21 reserves the right to collect, use or disclose personal information in certain
limited circumstances, without your knowledge and consent, where required or permitted by law.
Examples of this include:
1.      where it is clearly in your interests and your consent cannot be obtained in a timely way;
2.      in order to create aggregate information in order to identify Customer needs and trends,
        and to aid in the development of new services and products;
3.      where it is required, by law, to be disclosed to law enforcement and other government
        agencies;
4.      where it is reasonable to expect that disclosure with your consent would compromise an
        investigation or proceeding;
5.      where disclosure is for the purpose of complying with a subpoena, warrant or order
        issued or made by a Court; and
6.      where disclosure is required or authorized by law.
You may withdraw your consent to the collection, use and disclosure of personal information in
connection with the services that You have requested from us at any time, subject to legal or
contractual restrictions and reasonable notice. CENTURY 21 will inform You of the
implications of withdrawing your consent. If You wish to withdraw your consent at any time,
please contact CENTURY 21’s Privacy Officer (see below for contact information).
Access To Your Personal Information
You have the right to access your personal information in the possession or control of
CENTURY 21 and to know how that personal information has been and is being used, and to
whom it has been disclosed. CENTURY 21 reserves the right to refuse to comply with all or
part of a request where we are required to or are permitted to refuse to do so by the provisions of
applicable personal information protection legislation.
Applications must be in writing and be sent to our privacy officer either by mail or email at the
addresses set out below. Applications should have sufficient detail that allows us to identify You
and the personal information You are requesting.
You may ask to have errors or omissions in your personal information in our possession or
control corrected. If we are satisfied that the correction is reasonably necessary, we will correct
the personal information and notify anyone to whom we have provided the personal information
in the previous 12 months of the correction. If we are not satisfied that the correction should be
made, we will annotate the personal information under our control of the correction requested
but not made.
Requests for access and correction will usually be responded to within 30 calendar days of
receiving the request unless we apply to the applicable Privacy Commissioner for an extension.
We charge $25 plus $.25 per page for providing You with copies of your personal information.
In the event that it will take an unusually long time to collect your personal information, we may


                                                  4
charge more. In each case, we will give You a full quote before photocopying the personal
information. There is no charge for correcting personal information.
We will assist You with your request and will respond as accurately and completely as
reasonably possible. Where we refuse all or part of your request, we will give You the reasons
for the refusal and the applicable legislation on which we base our refusal; the name and contact
information of someone within CENTURY 21 who can explain the basis for the refusal and of
your right to apply to a Privacy Commissioner for review.
How We Protect Personal Information
CENTURY 21 makes reasonable efforts to ensure that personal information relating to You is
protected against loss and unauthorized access, collection, use, disclosure, copying, modifying,
disposal or similar risks. This protection applies in relation to personal information stored in
both electronic and hard copy form and will vary depending on the sensitivity of the information.
Access to non public personal information is restricted to selected employees or representatives
on a need-to-know basis. In addition, CENTURY 21 employs generally accepted information
security techniques, such as firewalls and access control procedures in order to protect personal
information against unauthorized access, collection, use, disclosure, copying, modifying,
disposal or similar risk.
Retention of Personal Information
CENTURY 21 retains personal information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purpose(s) for
which it was collected and to comply with applicable laws. Personal information which is
collected and used to make a decision about You is retained for at least 1 year. Your consent to
such purpose(s) remains valid after termination of CENTURY 21’s relationship with You.
Changes to this Privacy Policy
CENTURY 21 reserves the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time without notice. The
Privacy Policy distributed at any time or from-time-to time posted on the Website shall be
deemed to be the Privacy Policy then in effect.
Accountability
CENTURY 21 is responsible for the personal information under its control, and we have
designated a Privacy Officer who is responsible for our compliance with this Privacy Policy and
with applicable laws. Other individuals within CENTURY 21 may be delegated to act on behalf
of the Privacy Officer and CENTURY 21 will use appropriate means to provide a comparable
level of protection while information is being processed by a third party.

                     CENTURY 21 CANADA LIMITED PARTNERSHIP
                                WEBSITE PRIVACY POLICY
The following addresses the personal information we may collect about You during any
interaction with our website (the “Website”).
Your Acceptance of this Website Privacy Policy
By using the Website, You signify your agreement with and acceptance of CENTURY 21’s
Website Privacy Policy. If You do not accept this Website Privacy Policy, You must not access
or use the Website.
CENTURY 21 may, at any time, without notice or liability, revise this Website Privacy Policy
by updating this posting. You should periodically revisit this posting to review any revisions to
this Website Privacy Policy. If any revision is not acceptable to You, You must cease accessing
and using the Website. If You continue to access or use the Website after any revisions are
posted You will be deemed to have accepted those revisions.
Types of Personal Information
We receive two types of personal information from Customers who visit the Website: (1)
personal information that Customers provide through registration or other communication on the
Website; and (2) personal information CENTURY 21 gathers through aggregated tracking
procedures, such as tallying the number of page views throughout the Website over a given
period of time. The second type of personal information enables us to tailor the Website content
to better meet the needs of our Customers. However, we assure You that CENTURY 21 will not
disclose your personal information to third parties without first obtaining your consent, except in
conjunction with your participation in any online transaction CENTURY 21 may offer from time
to time.
How Does CENTURY 21 Collect Personal Information?
(a)     Registration: Personal information may be collected by specifically requesting it from
        You on the Website. Generally, this occurs when You register at the Website or
        otherwise request information or a service from us. Usually, the Website and its
        necessary service partners collect your personal information in order to facilitate the
        operation of the Website and to deliver the services it offers. The Website also uses your
        personal information to inform You of other products or services available from
        CENTURY 21 and its affiliates. The personal information gathered in this transaction is
        covered by the foregoing Privacy Policy.
(b)     Usage tracking:
        (i)     Use of IP Addresses: An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to
                your computer whenever You are surfing the Internet. Web servers automatically
                identify your computer by its IP address.


                                        7
     CENTURY 21 and/or its affiliates collect IP addresses for the purposes of system
     administration, to report aggregated information to our advertisers, and to audit
     the use of the Website. When Customers request pages from the Website, our
     servers log the requesting Customers’ IP addresses. Except where You participate
     in any online transaction CENTURY 21 may offer from time to time, we
     normally will not link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable, which
     means that Customers’ sessions will be logged, but Customer identity remains
     anonymous to us. We can and will use IP addresses to identify a Customer when
     we feel it is necessary to enforce compliance with our rules or terms of service or
     to protect our service, the Website, or any person, or where it is otherwise
     permitted by law.
(ii) Use Of Cookies: Cookies are bits of information that a website transfers to an
     individual’s hard drive for record-keeping purposes. Cookies make Web surfing
     easier for You by saving your preferences while You visit the Website. We never
     save passwords or credit card information in cookies. The use of cookies is an
     industry standard, and, as such, You’ll encounter them at most major websites.
     By showing how and when Customers use the Website, cookies help us see which
     areas are popular and which are not. Many improvements and updates to the
     Website are based on data collected using cookies, such as the total number of
     visitors and pages viewed in a given period of time. This kind of information is
     most easily tracked using cookies.
     CENTURY 21 and/or its affiliates have two primary uses for its cookies. First,
     we use them to specify preferences. For example, Customers can specify
     keywords across several categories or markets so You do not have to tell us over
     and over again about the kinds of homes You are interested in obtaining
     information about. Secondly, we use cookies to track Customer trends and
     patterns. This helps us to better understand our Customers’ needs and to improve
     areas of CENTURY 21 and/or its affiliates’ services that our Customers may find
     valuable. Sometimes, information from cookies is attached to messages sent to
     our Customer Service department. While all of these situations depend on the
     use of a cookie, You always have the option of disabling the receipt of cookies on
     your computer by adjusting the cookies setting in You Web browser preferences.
     Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. You can reset your Web
     browser to either refuse all cookies or indicate when a cookie is being sent, with a
     concurrent option to accept or receive the cookie. However, note that some of the
     services offered on the Website will not function properly or may be considerably
     slower if You refuse to receive cookies. For example, without cookies, You will
     not be able to set personalized preferences. You might also encounter difficulties
     participating in online transactions offered on the Website from time to time.
     Occasionally, You may receive cookies from our advertisers. CENTURY 21
     and/or its affiliates do not control these cookies. The use of advertising cookies
     sent by third-party servers is standard in the Internet industry.


                                                   8
With Whom Does CENTURY 21 Share Your Personal Information?
As a general rule, CENTURY 21 will not disclose any of your personal information except when
we have your permission or under special circumstances, such as when we believe in good faith
that the law requires it or under other specified circumstances, including those described below:
(a)     Business Partners & Sponsors: CENTURY 21 may disclose some or all your personal
        information to business partners or sponsors, but this use will be specifically described to
        You prior to either the collection or transfer of the personal information. Many
        promotions offer opportunities to request additional information from sponsors. By
        requesting more information, You give CENTURY 21 permission to transfer your
        personal information to the sponsor so they can fulfill your request. In many instances,
        only your e-mail address will be shared with the sponsor. If we intend on sharing more
        personal information with the sponsor than your e-mail, You will be notified prior to the
        transfer.
(b)     Third Party Data and Data in the Aggregate: From time to time, on the Website You may
        be offered the opportunity to receive material or special offers from third parties. If You
        opt to receive information from these third parties, CENTURY 21 will (with your
        permission) share your name and e-mail address with such third parties. Under
        confidentiality agreements, CENTURY 21 may match Customer information with third
        party data. Also, CENTURY 21 may disclose aggregated Customer statistics (i.e., where
        we disclose a characteristic of our Customers as a group and not as individuals) in order
        to describe our services to prospective partners, advertisers, and other third parties, and
        for other lawful purposes.
(c)     Other: CENTURY 21 may disclose account information in special cases when we have
        reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring
        legal action against someone who may be violating CENTURY 21’s Terms of Use or
        may be causing (either intentionally or unintentionally) injury to or interference with
        CENTURY 21’s rights or property, other CENTURY 21 Customers, or anyone else that
        could be harmed by such activities. CENTURY 21 may disclose or access account
        information when we believe in good faith that the law requires it and for administrative
        and other purposes that we deem necessary to maintain, service, and improve our
        products and services.
How Can You Control the Use of Your Personal Information?
In case You change your mind or some personal information changes (such as your zip code or
e-mail address), we will endeavour to provide a way to correct, update or remove the personal
information You give us. Additionally, to keep You in control of the communications directed
to You, we offer Customers the opportunity to “opt out” of having personal information shared
with parties outside of CENTURY 21 and/or its affiliated companies. If You wish, for any
reason, to update your personal information or if You object to any use of your personal
information described in this Website Privacy Policy, You may e-mail your requested change or
objection to: privacy@century21.ca. You may also contact privacy@century21.ca with any
questions or enquiries You may have concerning this Policy or about our privacy practices in
general.


                                                 9
What happens when You link to a Third Party Website?
You should be aware that when You are on the Website You could be directed to other third
party websites that are beyond our control. There may, from time to time, be links to other third
party websites from the Website that take You outside our service areas. For example, if You
“click” on a banner advertisement on the Website, the “click” typically takes You off the
Website. These other sites may include websites of advertisers, sponsors and partners that may
use CENTURY 21’s and/or its affiliates’ logos as part of a co-branding agreement. These other
websites may send their own cookies to Customers, or otherwise collect data or solicit
information.
CENTURY 21 and its affiliates do not control such third party websites, and, therefore, are not
responsible for their content. CENTURY 21’s and/or its affiliates’ provision of hyperlinks to
these websites does not imply any endorsement of the material on such websites or any
association with their operators. This Website Privacy Policy does not extend to anything that is
inherent in the operation of the Internet and which is beyond the control of CENTURY 21 and its
affiliates.
Please keep in mind that whenever You give out personal information online (for example, via
message boards or chat lines), that personal information can be collected and used by people You
do not know. While CENTURY 21 and its affiliates strive to protect their Customers’ personal
information and privacy, we cannot guarantee the security of any personal information You
disclose online and so You disclose such information at your own risk.
Is your Personal Information Secure from Others using the CENTURY 21 Website?
The importance of securing your personal information is of the utmost concern to us. We
exercise great care in providing secure transmission of your information from your computer to
our servers. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100%
secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, CENTURY 21 and its
affiliates cannot promise or warrant the security of any personal information You transmit to us,
including through the use of our online products or services. Any such transmission is done so at
your own risk. Once we receive your transmission, CENTURY 21 uses industry standard efforts
to safeguard the confidentiality of your personal information, such as firewalls and Secure
Socket Layers. However, ironclad security does not yet exist on the Internet.
