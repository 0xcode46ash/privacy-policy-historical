# CengageBrain - Privacy Policy

CengageBrain.com is a service (the "Service") provided by Cengage Learning and its affiliates (either "we" or "us"). We have a firm commitment to protecting your privacy. When you make purchases from, register with or use the Service, you provide us with personally identifiable information ("Personal Identifying Information"). This Policy explains the information practices that apply to your Personal Identifying Information, as well as the choices you can make about the ways this information is used by the Service. By signing up or by using the Service, you consent to the following information practices. 

In order to participate in the Service, you understand and agree that you may be asked to provide Personal Identifying Information as part of the registration process and at other points in using the Service, and that we will store information that you provide. In the course of our business we will use that information in aggregated form to provide statistical user data about our subscribers to advertisers, potential advertisers, and content licensors. At various points in using the Service, you may also need to provide additional Personal Identifying Information so that we can perform tasks you request in the Service, such as fulfill orders or make calculations to estimate financial aid eligibility. During the registration process, you are given the opportunity to indicate whether you want us or our partners to contact you about the Service, our sites, our other products and services, or products and services from other companies, or whether you do not want to receive any such notices. We will not disclose to third parties any specific Personal Identifying Information about you without your permission. 

You understand and agree that we may use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer the Service. Your IP address is required to help identify you and your shopping cart and to develop important demographic information about the users of the Service. 

We may use agents and contractors in order to help operate the Service and to provide fulfillment services. If such agents and contractors have access to Personally Identifiable Information, they are required to protect this information in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy by, for example, not using the information for any purpose other than to carry out the services they are performing for the Service. 

The Service may use cookies and web beacons (i.e., session information written to your computer by your browser) to help you keep track of where you left off when you were last working in any part of our sites. We do not, however, have access to any information about you from cookies you might receive while using the Service. 

You may remove information from our database, elect not to receive future communications, or choose to no longer receive the Service by sending e-mail stating your wishes to e-commerce@cengage.com. 

You may modify information previously provided by changing the information in the forms within the Service. 

We make available a secure page for entering sensitive information, protected by industry-standard SSL encryption technology. This technology encrypts your information prior to transmitting it over the Internet. 

We maintain the confidential information you provide us in a secure database. Except for those data elements that are necessary for authorizing credit card purchases, your confidential information is not retransmitted. Data elements needed to authorize credit card purchases are transmitted via secure SSL-encrypted link to our payment processors. Please keep in mind that while we have established safeguards to help prevent unauthorized access to or misuse of your Personally Identifiable Information, we cannot guarantee that your personally identifiable information will never be disclosed in a manner inconsistent with this Privacy Policy (for example, in the event of unauthorized acts by third parties that violate applicable law or our policies). 

If you have any questions about this privacy statement, the practices of the Service, or your dealings with this web site, please contact:
