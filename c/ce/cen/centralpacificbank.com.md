**Central Pacific Bank Privacy Policy**

Central Pacific Bank (CPB) is one of Hawaii’s leading financial institutions, offering a wide range of financial products for consumers and businesses.  The bank has been serving the Hawaii community since 1954.  We are very concerned about customer confidentiality and privacy.  Our employees treat the information we have concerning individual customers in the same responsible, confidential way that we want our own financial affairs treated. 

We want you to be informed of our commitment to protect the privacy of your personal financial information with the following privacy principles: 

**Recognition of your expectation of privacy**   
We recognize that you expect privacy and security for your personal and financial affairs.  We understand that, by selecting us for your banking needs, you have entrusted us to safeguard your personal financial information. 

**How we use, collect, and retain customer information**   
We collect, retain, and use information about you only when we reasonably believe that it will help administer our business or provide products, services, and other opportunities to you. 

We collect nonpublic personal information about you from the following sources: 

  * Information we receive from you on applications or other forms; 
  * Information about your transactions with us, or others; 
  * Information we receive from a consumer credit reporting agency, and 
  * Information we receive from public records, market research, and other sources, including any customer information that is provided by you on our web site. 

We collect and retain nonpublic personal information about you only for specific business purposes.  Nonpublic personal information is nonpublic information about you that we may obtain in connection with providing a financial product or service to you.  This could include information such as account balances, payment history, and overdraft history. 

We use information to: 

  * open and administer your accounts and to protect your records and funds 
  * comply with all applicable laws and regulations 
  * help us design or improve our financial products and services 
  * understand your financial needs so that we can provide you with quality products and superior service. 

We collect information about you to protect you.  We need to be able to identify you and the products and services you use to prevent unauthorized access to personal or financial information.  We also gather information to help us understand your financial needs and to provide you with quality products and services.  For example, if we know you own your own home, we know that a home equity loan may be a better financing alternative than an installment loan. 

In some cases, we gather information to help us design or improve our products and services.  For example, information obtained from customers can tell us whether to develop a new type of home mortgage or a new type of checking account.  This type of information enables us to identify the needs of customers in our community and provide services to meet those needs. 

Finally, we also gather information to comply with laws and regulations that govern the financial services industries.  For example, federal regulations require that we obtain a social security number or tax identification number for various types of deposit accounts. 

**How we keep customer information accurate**   
It is in your interest, and it is our objective, for us to have accurate, current, and complete information concerning you and your accounts.  We have strict procedures that our employees abide by to meet this objective.  While some procedures are required by federal or state law, we have implemented additional procedures to maintain accurate, current, and complete financial information, including processes to update information and remove outdated information.  If you believe that we have incorrect information about you or your accounts, please let us know by contacting CPB’s Customer Service Center at (808) 544-0500.  We will correct any erroneous information as quickly as possible. 

**How we limit access to customer information by our employees**   
We restrict access to nonpublic personal information about you to those employees who need to know that information to provide products or services to you.  We maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that comply with federal standards to guard your nonpublic personal information.  We educate our employees through our Code of Conduct on their responsibility to protect the confidentiality of customer information, and subject them to disciplinary action if they violate this privacy policy. 

**Our security procedures to protect customer information**   
We maintain strict security standards and procedures to help prevent unauthorized access to confidential information about you. 

**How we restrict the disclosure of customer information**   
CPB does not disclose any nonpublic personal information about you to anyone, except as permitted by law.  If you decide to close your account(s) or become an inactive customer, we will adhere to this privacy policy. 

As permitted by law, we may disclose the following information to companies that perform marketing services on our behalf or to other financial institutions, such as other banks, with which we have a joint marketing agreement: 

  * Information we receive from you on an application or other forms, such as your name, address, and social security number 
  * Information we receive from a consumer credit-reporting agency, such as your credit worthiness and credit history 

Consistent with the practice of financial institutions and other businesses, we share certain nonpublic personal information about our customers with reputable information reporting agencies, so creditors can verify the existence and condition of customer accounts.  We also provide information to third parties on whether there are sufficient funds to cover a check you have written on your account or funds transfer which you have initiated. 

As required by law, we will share information about you and your products and services if we are served with a subpoena or court order or to comply with any legal process.  We will also share information with federal or state regulatory authorities, such as banking examiners or the Internal Revenue Service as authorized by state or federal law. 

**Maintaining your privacy when we do business outside our organization**   
To assist us in offering you financial products and services, we may disclose your nonpublic personal information confidentially with companies or vendors who perform services on our behalf, such as computer processing.  As permitted by law, we may also disclose your nonpublic personal information to other financial institutions with whom we have joint marketing agreements.  For example, the Credit Card company which we work with who offers credit card services on our behalf to our customers. 

**Disclosing our privacy commitment to you**   
We want you to understand our commitment to personal privacy and have formulated this privacy policy. 

This privacy policy is provided to: 

  * a potential customer who inquires about our products and services or who would like a copy of our privacy policy 
  * a customer who has established a relationship with us.  (The privacy policy is provided at the time the relationship is established, and annually thereafter.)
