# Central Pacific Bank - Privacy Policy

  


##   
Privacy Policy

At Central Pacific Financial Corporation, and our affiliated companies, we are committed to customer confidentiality and privacy1. Our employees treat the information we have concerning individual customers2 in the same responsible, confidential way that we want our own financial affairs treated. **While we respect the privacy of all individuals and the relationships we have established, this policy does not apply to any business account(s) you may have.**

We want you to be informed of our commitment to protect the privacy of your personal financial information with the following privacy principles3:

## Collecting Information

We collect and retain customer information to offer you better service, more convenience, and to help you learn more about products and services that may be of interest to you. Customer information may be collected from a variety of sources, such as the following: 

  * **Application Information.** Information we receive from you on applications or other loan and account forms, such as your income and accounts; 
  * **Transaction and Experience Information.** Information about your transactions with us and our affiliates; 
  * **Consumer Report Information.** Information we receive from a consumer report, such as your credit history or creditworthiness; and 
  * **Information From Outside Sources.** Information from outside sources with your consent.   


  


## **Information We Disclose**

**A. Within Central Pacific Financial Corp.**  
The Central Pacific Financial Corp. family is made up of companies providing financial and other services, including Central Pacific Bank (CPB), Central Pacific HomeLoans, Inc., a mortgage broker, and others. We may share the customer information we collect described in the “Collecting Information” section with Affiliates.  By sharing information with Affiliates, we hope to better serve your financial needs. You may, however, opt-out of the use of such information by CPB and its affiliates for marketing purposes.

**B. With Outside Companies**  
We may share the customer information we collect described in the “Collecting Information” section, but only to the extent permitted by law with the following types of companies outside Central Pacific Financial Corp.: 

  * Financial service providers selected to provide our customers with specialized financial services, such as securities broker dealers or insurance companies. We disclose information only when we believe that this information is needed to offer you the product or service.  


  * Companies that provide support services for us for the purposes of servicing your account or performing marketing or similar services on our behalf or to financial institutions with whom we have joint marketing agreements, such as companies that provide you products and services that you’ve requested or already have with us. These companies may include check printers and companies that prepare or mail account statements. These companies are subject to contractual confidentiality provisions and may use the customer information we share only to provide the services we ask them to perform for you and us. 



**  
C. In Other Situations**  
We may also disclose certain customer information to government entities, credit bureaus and similar organizations, and otherwise as permitted by law. For example, customer information may be disclosed in connection with a subpoena or similar legal process, a fraud investigation, the recording of a mortgage in public records, or to provide information with your consent.

**D. **Credit Bureau Information****

In the regular course of business, Central Pacific Financial Corp. provides information to and obtains information from reputable credit reporting agencies in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. **If you believe that any of our Affiliates may have reported inaccurate information about any of your accounts to a consumer reporting agency please contact us at (808) 544-0500 (on Oahu), 1-800-342-8422 (Neighbor islands, continental U.S., Guam, Saipan, or Canada) or by Text Telephone (TTY) (808) 532-4920.**

We may report information about your accounts to credit bureaus. Late payments, missed payments, or other defaults on your account may be reflected in your credit report.

## Former Customers

If you decide to close your account(s) or become an inactive customer, we will continue to honor your request to opt-out of information sharing; however, you may receive marketing offers.

  


## Security Procedures

We also take steps to safeguard customer information. We restrict access to your personal and account information to those employees who need to know that information to provide products or services to you. We maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that comply with federal standards to guard your nonpublic personal information.

## Medical Information

You may sometimes provide medical information to us as part of an application for insurance. We do not share medical information among our family of companies or with third parties except to those who require access to this information in order to process the application. **We will not obtain, use, re-disclose or share – internally or externally – personal identifiable medical information in determining credit eligibility except as allowed by law, as disclosed to you when the information is collected, or when you consent.** Medical information (such as information related to your past, present, or future physical or mental health or condition) or the provision or payment of such healthcare services obtained as part of an application for insurance is shared only with those who require access to this information in order to process the application.

Under the California Financial Information Privacy Act, financial institutions are prohibited from disclosing nonpublic personal information to any nonaffiliated third party without prior written consent from the consumer (the consumer has opted-in) except as permitted by law.

The State of California is an opt-in state, meaning residents must submit a written request to have nonpublic personal information shared. Central Pacific Financial Corp. adheres to all applicable state and federal laws.
