### Centredaily.com Privacy Statement

**Centredaily.com** is a member of the Knight Ridder Real Cities Network (RCN), a national network of Web sites in the United States. **Centredaily.com** , along with the Real Cities Network, is strongly commited to protecting your privacy. The following FAQ for the entire RealCities Network should answer most of your important questions. However, if you still have concerns, please send email to [privacyissues@realcities.com](mailto:privacyissues@realcities.com?subject=Privacy_on_Centredaily.com). 

In order to provide convenient and personalized service to our Web site visitors, the Real Cities Network (RCN) has developed a variety of systems to collect and store customer information. You can take advantage of these systems by signing up for a Passport at a local RCN site currently offering Passport. As a Passport holder, you will enjoy a growing range of interactive features across the Network, including personalized home pages, Email News Digests, chat rooms, improved message boards, RCN promotions and sweepstakes, Premium Content, and more. 

In addition to greatly improving your online experience, knowing a bit more about you also allows us to display advertising to you in a more intelligent fashion. Targeted advertisements are probably more interesting for you, and they are definitely more productive for our advertisers. 

For all these reasons, Passports are an exciting development for Real Cities. Still, we understand how important your privacy is to you, and we hope that the following answers will reassure you that the information you have given us will not be missused. 

**Frequently Asked Questions about PRIVACY and related issues:**

  * Does the Real Cities Network ask for personal information?
  * How Does the Real Cities Network use my personal information?
  * How does the Real Cities Network target advertising? 
  * Will the Real Cities Network disclose any of my personal information?
  * Will the Real Cities Network use my information for direct mailings? 
  * Does the Real Cities Network use cookies and "IP Addresses"? 
  * What else should I know about my privacy? 
  * Want more information? Click here for helpful links ... 



* * *

**Does the RCN ask for personal information?**

> Yes. A Real Cities Passport consists of four basic elements: a username and a password, an email address, and a postal code. From time to time, you may wish to add information to your Passport in order to let other Passport holders get to know you better, to take advantage of more services or to participate in a special promotion or sweepstakes. 

* * *

**How does the RCN use this information?**

> The Real Cities Network (RCN) uses Passport information for two basic purposes: To improve your online experience by enabling personalization and interactivity and to help target advertisements. 

* * *

**How does the RCN target advertising?**

> When a Passport holder makes use of one of our services, such as a digest of sports stories delivered via email, we "remember" that the user is interested in sports. Then, when an advertiser wants to reach an audience of sports fans, we simply serve the advertisements to those users who we have been flagged as sports fans. Alternatively, if a local grocery market wants to get news of a sale to its community, we can display that advertisement to Passport holders with relevant Zip Codes. It is important to note that in such cases we do not share the details of your Passport information with the advertiser. We act as the middleman between you and the companies that want to reach you. 

* * *

**Will the RCN disclose any of my personal information?**

> RCN will disclose personal information in some limited circumstances. In all such cases, the purpose will be explained to you beforehand, and you will be informed when we collect the information, such as in the rules of sweepstakes or other promotions, or when we believe in good faith that the law requires it. When the RCN decides to integrate 3rd party services which depend upon customer information, the RCN may share its own customer information with the third party. In such cases, the 3rd party will be bound by the RCN privacy policy. Also, RCN does disclose aggregated user statistics (for example, 55% of our users come from the Southwest) in order to describe our services to prospective partners, advertisers, and other third parties, and for other lawful purposes. 

* * *

**Will RCN use my information for direct mailings?**

> Only if you have given us your permission. We will send you information about our productsand services, or other products and services we feel may be of interest to you. Only RCN (or agents working on behalf of RCN and under confidentiality agreements) will send you these direct mailings. If you do not want to receive such mailings, simply tell us when you give us your personal information. Or, at any time you can easily update your RCN Passport such that you no longer receive such offers and mailings. 

* * *

**Does the RCN use cookies and "IP Addresses"?**

> Yes. If you choose "automatic login" when you sign up for a Passport, the RCN stores a scrambled version of your Passport username in a permanent cookie so that we can remember who you are from one visit to the next. If you do not choose "automatic login", we will use a temporary cookie after you log in (which expires after each visit) to keep track of you as youmove from page to page during a given visit to our site. Without these cookies, it is impossible for us to provide any level of personalized service or to target advertising. In addition, some of our sites and advertising systems may set additional cookies which contain no personal information whatsoever. 
> 
> Other than the Passport Username, which is scrambled (and without a password), we do not store any sensitive information in these cookies, nor can we use the cookie to track your use of anything other than our web site. Think of these cookies as "claim checks". Like a coat room clerk, we use the cookie to help us keep track of your information on our systems. To anyone other than us, the information stored in your cookies is meaningless. 
> 
> You might wonder if another Web site or online user would be able to steal your Passport username from your cookie? The answer is no. Only your RCN site can read the information about your Passport Username. Due to the design of Web servers and browsers, no other Website has access to your RCN cookie and vice versa. However, if you have chosen Automatic Login, anyone who sits down at your computer can log on to our site using your Passport information. Because there is no financial information currently associated with your Passport, this is likely to be more of an inconvencience than it is a threat to your privacy. Still, users who share a machine may elect not to choose Automatic Login. 
> 
> The RCN may also collects IP addresses for the purposes of system administration and to report aggregate information to our advertisers. 

* * *

**What else should I know about protecting my privacy?**

> Please remember that the protection of your privacy begins with you. You are solely responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your Passport password, and you should always be careful and responsible whenever disclosing information online.
