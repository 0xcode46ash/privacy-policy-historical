### Cookies

CenturyTel collects information about your computer hardware and software -- for example, your IP address, domain name, and access times -- using "cookies." Cookies are files that Web browsers place on a visitor's computer. They are used to allow a more enjoyable visit, easier use of the site, and to accurately track visitor behavior. Cookies do not identify you personally; they merely recognize your browser, unless you choose to voluntarily identify yourself. You may choose to identify yourself for any one of the following reasons: asking the browser to remember your username and password; by responding to a promotional offer; or when personalizing a Web page or requesting more information on a product or service, otherwise you remain an anonymous Web site visitor.

When you interact with our Web site, we strive to make that experience easy and meaningful. Our site uses session cookies to track Web visitor behavior and to allow our customers to immediately save their User IDs, as well as personal settings on specific pages. This allows us to process your information and quickly log you into the product. Session cookies also help us make sure you are who you say you are after you have logged in. 

We use persistent cookies that _only CenturyTel can read and use_ , to identify the fact that you are either a CenturyTel customer, or a prior CenturyTel Web site visitor. We are especially careful about the security and confidentiality of the information stored in persistent cookies. Users who disable their Web browsers' ability to accept cookies will still be able to browse our Web site; however, they may lose some of the functionality provided by the use of persistent cookies.
