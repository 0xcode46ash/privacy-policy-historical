_**Use of Information**_

**Internal Use**

  * We will use your personally identifiable information in order to respond to your request, process your contribution or fulfill your online order.  Your credit card information will be temporarily stored on a secured server (see [Security](http://www.centralparknyc.org/site/PageServer?pagename=about_privacystatement#Security)) only for as long as necessary to process your payment.    
 
  * We may use your information to inform you of events, send you CPC newsletters, request monetary contributions, and send you promotions and updates about the Park.  E-mail recipients may opt out of receiving e-mails by following the unsubscribe instructions included in the e-mail message, changing your user profile, e-mailing [website@centralparknyc.org](mailto:website@centralparknyc.org "E-mail website@centralparknyc.org"), or calling 212-310-6600.    
 
  * From time to time, CPC will send surveys. Unless we inform you otherwise, your voluntary participation in these surveys is completely anonymous. We use the information gathered from the surveys to better understand our online users, donors, members and friends and determine how best to serve them.   
 
  * CPC may combine the information you provide us online with other personally identifiable information, such as geographical information and purchase history, in order to better serve our visitors.    
 
  * CPC Web site automatically collects some anonymous "non-personally identifiable" aggregate information, which may include visitor’s browsers (e.g., Internet Explorer or Mozilla Firefox), operating systems (e.g., Windows or Macintosh), Internet Service Providers, and other similar information.  The information collected is used for statistical purposes to monitor how CPC’s online visitors navigate our site, allowing us to tailor our Web site to better accommodate our visitors. 



**External Use**

CPC requires its vendors by contract to maintain the confidentiality and security of CPC information to which they are provided access and restricts the vendors from using the information in any way not expressly authorized by CPC.  
 
  * _Sharing CPC’s List of Supporters:_   CPC may, on occasion, share the name and the address of inactive members and supporters with other like-minded organizations.  Exchanging our list with other reputable charitable organizations is the most cost effective way to find new supporters.  As part of CPC’s exchange policy, other organizations will have access to a shared list for a limited time and will not have continued access to CPC’s list unless an individual voluntarily chooses to respond to their initial mailing. If you prefer not to have your name and address shared in this way, you may request to have your information removed from a shared list at any time by contacting [membership@centralparknyc.org](mailto:membership@centralparknyc.org "E-mail membership@centralparknyc.org"), or calling 212-310-6607.  You will also have regular opportunities to “opt-out” by checking the appropriate box or following the instructions located on solicitation materials.

  _Please note: CPC does not rent or sell donor lists.   Active members/donors are always deleted from all shared lists.  CPC never shares the information we receive from customers making an online purchase from the Central Park Store._

  *  _Marketing:_ We have relationships with companies that conduct charitable sales promotions and commercial co ventures that support us in our mission and activities. If you provide us with your mailing address and or e-mail address, you may receive promotional mailings regarding these co ventures. Your choice to participate in these special promotions will benefit us. You are under no obligation to respond and you may “opt out” of receiving promotional mailings and e-mails at any time by e-mailing [website@centralparknyc.org](mailto:website@centralparknyc.org "E-mail website@centralparknyc.org"), changing your user profile online, or calling 212-310-6600.  E-mail recipients will also have regular opportunities to “opt out” by following the unsubscribe instructions included in the e-mail message.
