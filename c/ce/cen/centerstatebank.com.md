# Center State Bank

At Center State Bank we recognize that safeguarding your financial information is of the utmost importance.  We acknowledge the sensitivity of this information and take every precaution to ensure your privacy.  The following covers the circumstances in which we will collect, maintain and use any information you may provide to us On-line.  If you have any questions about your privacy or the accuracy of your account information, please contact us.

**Our Use, Collection, and Retention of Customer Information**

Primarily, the collection of personal information On-line is designed to assist the bank in performing its basic business functions and provide outstanding customer service.  The information collected allows us to offer specific products and services that we believe will be most useful to you.  We will also use information we collect to identify you, to communicate with you and to assist us in responding to your questions.

**Restrictions on the Disclosure of Account Information**

We may disclose information about your accounts as well as personal information provided to the Bank through its On-line Sites to credit bureaus or agencies who have a legitimate purpose for obtaining the information.  However, we will in no way compromise or violate the security of your information.

**Maintaining Your Privacy in Business Relationships with Outside Third Parties**

Sometimes it is necessary to provide personally identifiable information about you to a third party in order to complete transactions.  Also, this may be necessary for transfers or to verify the existence and condition of your account for a third party, such as a credit bureau or merchant, and to comply with a government agency or court order or at the request of a federal regulator, with your permission.  These vendors and service companies agree to safeguard our confidential information about you and your products and services with us and absolutely must abide by applicable law.

**Employee Access and Use of Customer Information**

CenterState Bank employees are permitted access to the information necessary to perform their jobs.  The bank maintains stringent internal policies against the unauthorized disclosure or use of customer information.  We thoroughly educate our employees about the importance of confidentiality and customer privacy through standard operating procedures and training programs.  We take appropriate disciplinary measures to enforce employee privacy responsibilities.

**Maintaining Customer Privacy in Our Business Relationships**

Periodically, CenterState Bank contracts with outside vendors and other business partners to perform specific tasks for the Bank.  Such parties are strictly prohibited from using the information for their own benefit, or allowing any other party to access this information.  The Bank selects business partners and vendors that adhere to similar privacy standards as we do.  Also, we completely expect those persons we contract to honor and safeguard any information regarding our customers.
