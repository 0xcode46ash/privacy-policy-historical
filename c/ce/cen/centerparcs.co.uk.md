**HOW WE USE COOKIES**  
A cookie helps analyse web traffic or lets you know when you visit a particular site. Cookies allow web applications to respond to you as an individual. The web application can tailor its operations to your needs, likes and dislikes by gathering and remembering information about your preferences. For example, when you visit an online store, a cookie allows your basket content to be remember as your browse from page to page. The cookie file is placed on your hard drive and keeps track of your basket, and can be used to analyse your journey through the website to improve the website in the future.

We currently contract with several online partners to help manage and optimize our Internet business and communications. We use the services of a marketing company to help us measure the effectiveness of our advertising and how visitors use our site. To do this, we use Web beacons and cookies provided by our marketing company on this site. The type of information we collect includes the pages visited, a booking and value of the booking. By supplementing our records, this information helps us learn things like what pages are most attractive to our visitors, which of our products most interest our customers, and what kinds of offers our customers like to see. Although our marketing company logs the information coming from our site on our behalf, we control how that data may and may not be used. If you do not want to help us learn how to improve our site, products, offers and marketing strategy, you can "opt-out" of this website analysis tool by clicking here: <http://centerparcs.112.2o7.net/optout.html>

Overall, cookies help us provide you with a better web site, by enabling us to monitor which pages you find useful and which you do not. A cookie in no way gives us access to your computer or any information about you, other than the data you choose to share with us. This practice is strictly in force. We know that people have concerns about cookies, but we believe that the benefit we both gain from their proper use is worthwhile. You may set most popular web browsers to notify you of cookie placement requests or decline cookies completely. You can delete the files that contain cookies - those files are stored as part of your web browser.

The law which applies to how we use cookies and similar technologies for storing information on a user’s equipment such as their computer or mobile device changed on 26 May 2011. We will be working towards implementing the new guidelines for the use of cookies. If you want to read more information about this law, please download the document: Changes to the rules on using cookies and similar technologies for storing information from the Information Commissioner's Office website.
