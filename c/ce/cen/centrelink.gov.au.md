Centrelink places great emphasis on maintaining and enhancing the privacy and security of customer information. With a number of strong security measures in place and with the continued development of our internet services, our main focus is on improving existing measures as well as keeping you informed about the latest developments.

Centrelink collects a range of information about visits to the Centrelink site. This information is stored for twelve months and includes:

  * Entry and exit pages
  * How often the site was used
  * The time of day the site was accessed
  * The length of time spent on the site
  * How much information was downloaded
  * If the visit is from a company or an individual
  * If you are browsing from Australia or Overseas 
  * What browser types are being used



This information is collected for statistical analysis use only and no attempt is made by Centrelink to identify users or their browsing activities. 

Personally identifiable information such as your name, physical address and e-mail address can be supplied to Centrelink when sending personal messages. Personal information collected by Centrelink is protected by the Privacy Act 1988 and /or the confidentiality provisions of other legislation administered by Centrelink. The information you provide will only be used for the purpose for which you have provided it. Your details will not be added to a general mailing list and we will not use your e-mail address or other personal information for any purpose other than the purpose for which it was provided. Unless required by law, we will not disclose this information without your consent. 

You can send a secure message to Centrelink and the content of the message is automatically safeguarded while it is being sent. This is done by an encryption process which makes your message safe from interception while it is being sent to Centrelink. This is important to protect your privacy. The encryption process used in Centrelink is Secure Socket Layer (SSL). For SSL encryption to work, your browser must support SSL. Freely available browsers that support SSL include Netscape version 3 or higher and Microsoft Internet Explorer Version 4. Go to our [Downloads](https://web.archive.org/web/20010405225320id_/http%3A//www.centrelink.gov.au/internet/internet.nsf/site_help/downloads.htm) section of the site to get the latest version of these browsers. 

We are encrypting all messages between the browser running on your PC and Centrelink's computers when these messages are sent from the Secure Messages section of the website. For more detailed information about privacy in general please refer to [Privacy & Your Personal Information](https://web.archive.org/web/20010405225320id_/http%3A//www.centrelink.gov.au/internet/internet.nsf/legal/privacy_info.htm).

Once you choose one of the secure message options, a form is displayed which you may complete and submit to send your message to Centrelink, or you may decide not to send a message.

To further safeguard your privacy, your only exit from the secure message forms is either by clicking on the 'Cancel and Return to Menu' link, or one of the 'Cancel' or 'Submit' buttons. For more information on using these forms, please refer to the [Form Help](https://web.archive.org/web/20010405225320id_/http%3A//www.centrelink.gov.au/internet/internet.nsf/contact_us/form_help.htm).
