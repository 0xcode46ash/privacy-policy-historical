CESweb Privacy Statement: Our Commitment to You   


Our commitment to privacy

Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy, we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used. To ensure this notice is easy to find, it is available on our homepage and at every point where personal identification is requested.    


The way we use information

We use the information you provide when placing an order or making a request only in the context of your involvement with CES. We use the information to the extent necessary to complete an order/request you placed. We use the information you provide about someone else when placing an order only to ship the product and to confirm delivery. We do not share the information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to complete that order or as described below. 

E-mail Use  
We use return e-mail addresses to answer the e-mail we receive and for future contact with you. Such addresses are not shared with outside parties without your permission. If you would like your e-mail address removed from the CES list, please click on or copy and paste the following link into your browser [http://www.CESweb.org/listremove](http://www.cesweb.org/listremove), and enter your e-mail address. Removal requests made any other way may not be processed. NOTE: When you remove your name from the list, you will not receive further show updates regarding the International CES via e-mail.

Address and Fax Number Use  
As a service to exhibitors, partners and sponsors, we make CES attendee/guests mailing addresses and fax numbers (only) available to these companies for pre-and post-show promotion for limited use through a third party vendor. If you would like your name, mailing address and fax number removed from these promotional opportunities, please e-mail CES Customer Service at [CESinfo@CE.org](mailto:CESinfo@CE.org). You may also contact CES Customer Service by phone at (866) 233-7968 (USA), (301) 631-3983 (International), or by fax at (703) 907-7675. When you remove your name from the list, you will not receive further show updates regarding the International CES, via fax or mail. Be sure to include whether you want to be removed from CES lists, exhibitor/sponsor/partner lists, or both.

Cookies  
A cookie is a piece of data stored on the userâ€™s computer and is tied to information about the user. (Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personal information while on our site.) We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. For the session ID cookie, once you close your browser, the cookie simply terminates. A persistent cookie is a small text file stored on your hard drive for an extended period of time. CES uses cookies to gather information about your visits and to help customize your experience while on our website. If cookies are disabled on your browser, you will still be able to access our website. 

We use non-identifying and aggregate information to better design our website and to share with advertisers. For example, we may tell an advertiser that X number of individuals visited a certain area on our website, or that Y number of men and Z number of women filled out our registration form, but we would not disclose any information that could be used to identify those individuals. 

  


Our commitment to data security

To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online.    


Our commitment to children's privacy

Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important. For that reason, we never collect or maintain information at our website from those we actually know are under the age of 13, and no part of our website is structured to attract anyone under the age of 13.    


How you can access or correct your information

If you are a registered exhibitor, you can access and amend your information online. If you are an attendee, you can amend your information online until December 20, 2005, or you may e-mail CES Customer Service at [CESinfo@CE.org](mailto:CESinfo@CE.org) for assistance. You also may contact CES Customer Service by phone at (866) 233-7968 (USA), (301) 631-3983 (International), or by fax at (703) 907-7675.

You may correct factual errors in your personal information by sending us a request that illustrates the error. 

To protect your privacy and security, we also will take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access or making corrections. 

  


How to contact us

Should you have other questions or concerns about these privacy policies, please contact CES Customer Service at [CESinfo@CE.org](mailto:CESinfo@CE.org), by phone at (866) 233-7968 (USA), (301) 631-3983 (International), or by fax at (703) 907-7675.
