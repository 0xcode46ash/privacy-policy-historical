# 2001 International CES: Privacy Statement

Our Commitment To Privacy

Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used. To make this notice easy to find, we make it available on our homepage and at every point where personally identifiable information may be requested.

The Information We Collect

This notice applies to all information collected or submitted on the www.CESweb.org website. On some pages, you can order products, make requests, and register to receive materials. The types of personal information collected at these pages are:

    Name
    Title
    Company Name(s)
    Address
    Company Type
    Email address
    Phone number
    Fax
    Credit/Debit Card Information
    Products Manufactured
    Store Front Information
    Company's Gross Annual Sales
    Buying Influence

The Way We Use Information

We use the information you provide about yourself when placing an order only in the context of your involvement with CES. We use this information to the extent necessary to complete a placed order.

We use the information you provide about someone else when placing an order only to ship the product and to confirm delivery. We do not share this information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to complete that order.

We use return email addresses to answer the email we receive and for further contact with you. Such addresses are not shared with outside parties.

We use non-identifying and aggregate information to better design our website and to share with advertisers. For example, we may tell an advertiser that X number of individuals visited a certain area on our website, or that Y number of men and Z number of women filled out our registration form, but we would not disclose anything that could be used to identify those individuals.

As a service to exhibitors and sponsors, we make CES attendee/guests mailing addresses and fax numbers (only) available to companies exhibiting at CES for pre-and post-show promotion. If you would like your name and address removed from those promotional opportunities, please [email CES Customer Service](https://web.archive.org/web/20010405173730id_/http%3A//www.cesweb.org/contact.asp?emailSubject=Remove) at [CESinfo@ce.org](mailto:CESinfo@ce.org). You may also contact CES Customer Service by phone at 703 907 7605, or by fax at 703 907 7675.

Our Commitment To Data Security

To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online.

Our Commitment To Children's Privacy

Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important. For that reason, we never collect or maintain information at our website from those we actually know are under 13, and no part of our website is structured to attract anyone under 13.

How You Can Access Or Correct Your Information

If you are a registered exhibitor, you can access and amend your information online starting August 2000. If you are an attendee, you will need to [email CES Customer Service](https://web.archive.org/web/20010405173730id_/http%3A//www.cesweb.org/contact.asp?emailSubject=Correction) at [CESinfo@ce.org](mailto:CESinfo@ce.org) to amend your information. You may also contact CES Customer Service by phone at 703 907 7605, or by fax at 703 907 7675.

You can correct factual errors in your personally identifiable information by sending us a request that credibly shows error.

To protect your privacy and security, we will also take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access or making corrections.

How To Contact Us

Should you have other questions or concerns about these privacy policies, please contact CES Customer Service at [CESinfo@ce.org](mailto:CESinfo@ce.org), by phone 703 907 7605, or by fax 703 907 7675.
