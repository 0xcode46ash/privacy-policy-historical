**CEIVA PRIVACY POLICY**

Ceiva, manufacturer of the world's first Internet picture frame, cares about your privacy. Ceiva's website logs your IP address (the Internet address of your computer) and browser type, however we do not link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable about you. Your session will be tracked, but your identity remains anonymous. 

As a registered user, we ask that you provide us with your name, email address, preferences and other types of demographic information. Demographic information helps us learn more about your product needs and concerns. Other personal information may be gathered on your order form for our product, which would include billing and mailing addresses, credit card or other financial data to make an electronic funds transfer to purchase our product. 

Occasionally, we will use your registration information to send you special offers. We might also share information with our business partners who are listed in the "Partner" section of this website.

Your contact information will only be used to send you the product that you purchase and your billing information will only be used to bill you for the product. 

When you place your order online, your personal information and credit card information are encrypted or encoded. This makes it very difficult for your information to be stolen or intercepted while being transferred over the Internet. When we receive your order, it is kept encrypted until we are ready to process it. Your credit card information is erased from our website database so it in not connected to the Internet and is therefore more protected from "hackers."
