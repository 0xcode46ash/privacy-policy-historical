**1\. INTRODUCTION**  
**This Privacy Policy applies to all personal data provided to CSID from subscribers applying to use our services.**

CSID combines multiple layers of protection and goes beyond basic credit monitoring for 360 degrees of identity defense. We offer comprehensive protection that reviews your credit and non-credit identity records in order to protect your identity. Protecting our subscriber’s privacy is at the forefront of CSID.

If you are visiting our site from a country in the [European Union (EU)](http://europa.eu/about-eu/countries/index_en.htm?__hstc=26052066.d82778bf652a2032b5dace026eeaab4e.1398707838439.1399483920715.1399990885164.4&__hssc=26052066.2.1399990885164&__hsfp=1924490115) please also refer to the section relating to this below.

**2\. WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT AND WHY?**

We may collect personal information from which you can be identified, such as your name, date of birth, postal and e-mail address, phone number, national identifier or social security number (as applicable) and credit card details.

We will use this data to access and monitor various data sets that you request us to monitor as part of your identity protection service and for the prevention and detection of fraud. When you close your account, we may continue to share information about you according to our legal and regulatory requirements.

We will use the information you provide us solely for the purpose of providing you with the products and services you have requested and for administering our relationship with you, internal business purposes, our product or service development and/or statistical analysis.

In some instances, we may ask information from you about others (such as your child’s information). We will only use that information for the specific reason for which it was provided to us.

**3\. DO WE DISCLOSE OR SHARE YOUR INFORMATION?**

We will share your personal information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this Privacy Policy. **We do not sell your personal information to, or share such personal information with, third parties for their promotional use or for marketing purposes.**

In order for us to provide you with our identity protection service and for the prevention and detection of fraud, we will share your personal information with third parties who perform services on our behalf. Depending on the service you have requested, we may share your name, e-mail address, national identifier or social security number (as applicable), income, account balances, payment history and credit history with credit bureaus. We will also share your billing information with a credit card processing company in order to bill you for goods and services. These companies are authorized to use your personal information only as necessary to provide these services to us.

As may be required by law, we may also disclose your personal information, for example to comply with a subpoena, or similar legal process, when we believe in good faith that the disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request.

In addition, in the event of a merger, acquisition, or any form of sale of some or all of our assets to a third party, we may also disclose your personal information to the third parties concerned or their professional advisors. In the event of such a transaction, the personal information held by CSID will be among the assets transferred to the buyer.

**4\. IS YOUR INFORMATION SECURE?**

We have appropriate physical, technical and organizational measures in place to protect your data when held by CSID that comply with relevant legal and best practice requirements. When you enter sensitive information (such as a credit card, social security number or login credentials) as part of the enrollment process, we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).

When you submit information to CSID through our web site, you should be aware that your information is transmitted across the Internet and that no method of transmission over the Internet is 100% secure. Although we take reasonable security measures to protect your information when we receive it, you also need to ensure you take appropriate steps to protect your information.

We will obtain assurances from any agents we may use to help provide this service that they will safeguard personal information consistently with this Privacy Policy, which assurance will require the agent to provide the same level of protection as is required by the relevant Safe Harbor Principles and the EU Data Protection Directive.

**5\. INFORMATION RELATED TO DATA COLLECTED FOR OUR CLIENTS**

In most cases, CSID resells its services through its commercial clients (“Clients”). Accordingly, CSID does not have a direct relationship with the individuals whose personal data it processes when CSID acts as a wholesaler of its services. If you are a customer of one of our Clients and would no longer like to be contacted by one of our Clients that resells our services, please contact the specific Client that you interact with directly. We may transfer your personal information to third parties who perform services on our behalf or help us provide our services.

An individual who seeks access, or who seeks to correct, amend, or delete enrollment data should direct his or her query to CSID’s Client (the data controller). If requested to edit enrollment data by our Client, we will respond within 30 days. In some cases, we will edit enrollment data on behalf of our Clients. When managing choice options on behalf of our Clients, we will also respond to any requests within 30 days. We will retain personal data we process on behalf of our Clients for as long as needed to provide services to our Client. CSID will retain this personal information for so long as necessary to comply with our legal and audit obligations, to resolve disputes and to enforce our agreements.

**6\. WILL WE SEND YOU OFFERS OF OTHER CSID PRODUCTS AND SERVICES?**

Our range of identity protection products and services is constantly evolving to match the increasingly sophisticated market in which we operate. We will not send you details of other CSID products or services or those of any reputable third parties without your prior consent and you can change your mind at any time by contacting us. If you no longer wish to receive our promotional communications, you may opt-out of receiving them by following the instructions included in each communication or by e-mailing us at the e-mail address provided below or by contacting us through one of the methods listed below.

**7\. ARE YOU VISITING OUR WEB SITE FROM A COUNTRY IN THE EUROPEAN UNION (E.U.)?**

CSID, based in the United States, maintains servers in both the United States and the United Kingdom. If you are visiting our web site from outside the United States, your personal information, in some rare instances, may be transferred to, stored, and/or processed in the United States. If your personal information enters our servers in the United States, CSID will protect your data in accordance with the Safe Harbor Principles outlined below.

The United States Department of Commerce and the European Commission have agreed on a set of data protection principles and frequently asked questions (the “Safe Harbor Principles”) to enable U.S. companies, such as CSID, to satisfy the requirement under European Union law that adequate protection be given to personal information transferred from the E.U. to the United States.

CSID complies with the U.S.–E.U. Safe Harbor framework and the U.S.–Swiss Safe Harbor framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal data from European Union member countries and Switzerland. CSID has certified that it adheres to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access, and enforcement. To learn more about the Safe Harbor program, please visit <http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/> and to view CSID’s certification, please visit <https://safeharbor.export.gov/companyinfo.aspx?id=28491>.
