### Q1: Why does CSI need my personal information? What will you use it for?

CSI collects a limited amount of personal information to create your personal profile, a tool that distinguishes you from all other CSI students. Specifically, CSI will use that profile and your information to:

  * Keep records of your education, course history and designation progress
  * Prepare regulatory reports if you're seeking industry licenses
  * Give you your course marks
  * Process your course or seminar enrolment
  * Tell you about new CSI courses and opportunities
  * Send you course materials, and awards
  * Maintain your individual investment simulation information
  * Share third-party offerings that we think you'd be interested in



### Q2: Do I have to provide my personal information?

You can decide not to provide CSI with your personal information, however it will prevent us from creating your student profile. Without your student profile, we’ll be unable to process your enrolment. You can still attend CSI courses, but you would be unable to write an exam or attain accreditation. It’s important to know that not all the information CSI requests is mandatory.

Here is a sample list of questions we need to ask:

  1. Name (first name and surname)
  2. Contact address (street address, city/town, province, country, postal code
  3. Telephone number and email address 
  4. Business address, telephone number and email address (under certain circumstances)
  5. Birth date
  6. Payment/credit card information
  7. Name of course/service you are enrolled in



Any optional information you provide helps us to understand you better, so we can better anticipate your needs. For example, we would like to know why you have chosen CSI so we can assist you in managing your career with relevant products and services. We would also like to know what your background is to be able to talk about our courses in a meaningful way. Examples of optional information include:

  1. Reason for enrolment
  2. Years of financial services experience
  3. Education level
  4. Gender
  5. Survey questions



### Q3: Can you tell me more about the privacy legislation enacted in 2004?

CSI respects your privacy, and has created this policy in response to the above legislation. You can learn more about the legislation on the federal government's privacy website at [www.privcom.gc.ca](http://www.privcom.gc.ca/).

### Q4: Will you share my personal information with any other companies?

Under no circumstances will CSI sell or distribute your information. We’re dedicated to protecting your privacy. With that in mind and in order to serve you better, CSI may share your file to make sure we're offering the most efficient and effective learning experience available.

_Specific instances when this might happen include:_

  * Sharing your personal information with our suppliers and agents to print and distribute course materials, to survey you or with a CSI subsidiary to offer you additional financial market resources
  * Compiling records and report tracking information like general pass or failure trends to continually enhance our product and service offerings. In this case, your Student ID is used so your name is never associated with your results
  * Reporting to regulators. Regulators can ask CSI for information about licensed registrants or students who apply to be registered. There are also rare occasions where CSI will report events to the IIROC or other licensing regulators (eg. In the case of significant academic infractions)
  * CSI may, from time to time, partner with companies that offer student or alumni benefits through their products. CSI will handle the first contact with you and give you the option to opt out of future communications from those companies. In choosing its partners to present to you, CSI will require those companies to certify that they will treat your personal information with the same standard of care that we do



### Q5: Can my employer see my personal information?

If you're enrolling through your employer, they may require that you complete an information release consent form. That form allows CSI to share information with your employer should they request it. If you are not enrolling through your employer, we will not share information with them.

### Q6: How do you protect my personal information?

CSI takes a number of steps to protect your information

**ONLINE:** CSI's website at www.csi.ca is a secure site – you will see a lock icon appear on your screen (usually in the lower right corner but the actual location may change depending on your operating system and browser).That symbol means that any information you enter (name, date of birth, payment information etc.) while on that page is protected using industry-standard Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption technology.

**HARD COPY:** CSI gives equal priority to protecting your personal information when it appears in paper-based forms or reports. All documents that contain your personal information are kept in a locked cabinet or room at CSI with restricted access.

### Q7: How long will CSI keep information about me?

CSI needs your personal information to provide certain services during your enrolment period. Once that time has ended, CSI will retain some information such as your exam marks and acquired CSI designations, as well as your contact information indefinitely.

### Q8: What am I agreeing to when I consent to CSI's privacy policy?

CSI's privacy policy has been created to protect your personal information. By signing this policy (or selecting "I accept" online) you are agreeing and consenting to share your personal information with CSI for use and disclosure by CSI under the conditions set out in this policy.

### Q9: Who should I contact with questions or concerns about the privacy policy?
