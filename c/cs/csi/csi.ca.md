Any changes to this Privacy Policy will become effective when we post or link to the revised Privacy Policy on the Site. Please review the “LAST UPDATED” legend at the top of this page to determine when this Privacy Policy was most recently revised. 

You do not have to provide us with any Personal Data to visit the public portions of the Site. However, if you choose to withhold requested information, you may not be able to visit all sections or use all features of the Site or access the educational services offered by Moody’s.  Please note that by accessing the Site, you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Policy and consenting to our collection, use and disclosure of your Personal Data and Other Data (defined below) as set out in this Privacy Policy and to our use of your contact details to contact you for purposes of applicable personal information privacy statutes, credit bureau reporting rules, anti-spam legislation and consumer protection legislation. If you do not agree to all of the terms of this Privacy Policy, please do not use this Site. Please read this Privacy Policy carefully.

This Privacy Policy shall apply to any Moody’s mobile application and other forms of Moody’s online activity that reference this Privacy Policy. In such instances, the term “Site” shall include the applicable mobile application or other Moody’s online activity whenever that term is used herein. In connection with your use of any Moody’s mobile application, your Personal Data (and Other Data, as described below]  may also be collected and used by your mobile device manufacturer, the mobile application store from which you obtained the Moody’s mobile application, your telecommunication provider, or other third parties involved in the delivery of the application or data to your mobile device, and such practices shall be subject to the privacy policy of the applicable third party. Moody’s is not responsible for any third party’s privacy practices. 

### Types of Data Collected

We gather your Personal Data and Other Data as described below.   
"Personal Data" is information that identifies you or can be used to identify or contact you (e.g., your name, email address, address, birthdate and/or phone number). Personal Data will also be deemed to include the testing, performance and completion data related to any courses and/or seminars you enroll in as part of the educational services provided by Moody’s.

  * Moody’s requests various pieces of Personal Data from you when you register for educational services, on the Site and otherwise. The registration process may require that you provide Personal Data (including but not necessarily limited to your name, date of birth,  primary and secondary email addresses, business address, business phone number and company affiliation) and agree to the terms and conditions of the applicable Moody's educational services in effect at the time of registration. 
  * Moody’s may collect Personal Data voluntarily provided by you, including in emails to the Site, online forms, order and registration forms, surveys, promotion participation, phone calls with Moody’s customer service and through offline means.  In some cases, your employer (or other organization that is sponsoring your registration in the educational services provided by Moody’s) may provide your Personal Data to Moody’s on your behalf. 
  * In some cases, we may use third-party payment services (each, a "Payment Service") to collect payments made through the Site. If you wish to make a payment through the Site, you may be directed to a webpage that is hosted by the Payment Service (or the Payment Service's service providers) and not by Moody’s. Any Personal Data that you provide through a Payment Service page will be collected by Payment Service and not by Moody’s, and will be subject to Payment Service's privacy policy, rather than this Privacy Policy. Moody’s has no control over, and is not responsible for, Payment Service's use of information collected through the Payment Service Page.  Note that in some cases, payment information is provided directly to Moody’s and in such cases, the terms of this Privacy Policy shall apply.
  * Moody’s collects Personal Data through various means other than the Site, including participation at conferences, individual introductions, and from employers that enroll their employees in our educational services. From time to time, we may also acquire from third parties certain lists containing the names and contact information of individuals who may be interested in our products and services. If we acquire such a list for promotional purposes, whenever  practicable, we seek to obtain appropriate representations from the other party that the listed individuals have consented to receiving, or are otherwise eligible to receive, promotional messages from any acquirer of such list in compliance with applicable law. 



### Use of Personal Data Collected

We may use Personal Data for the following purposes: 

  * **Educational Service Delivery.**     Moody’s shall use your Personal Data for items related to the delivery of educational services, including but not limited to, the creation of your student account, the delivery of online or in-person seminar training and related materials, mentoring and exam services, delivering testing results, maintaining your student performance and course completion record and notifying you of updates regarding the educational services. 
  * **Reporting to Regulators.**     Moody’s is requested in various cases to provide information to securities industry (and other) regulators that our students may be registered with, seeking registration with or are otherwise governed by (including but not limited to the Investment Industry Regulatory Organization of Canada or “IIROC”). Moody’s may provide your Personal Data to such regulators, including but not limited to, Personal Data sufficient to identify you,  your course completion and course performance information, to the extent that such information is requested by the regulator. 
  * **Other Communications.**    From time to time, we may use Personal Data about you to inform you of products, programs, services and promotions that we believe may be of interest to you. If your employer is a Moody’s customer, we may also inform you of such products, programs, services and promotions using Personal Data about you that your employer provided to Moody’s. If you would prefer that we not send electronic marketing messages to you, please see the "Your Choices" section below. However, in accordance with applicable law, you may continue to receive certain electronic messages for which we do not require your express consent to send. 
  * **Promotions.**    We may operate sweepstakes, contests and similar promotions (collectively, "Promotions"). We typically ask you for certain Personal Data when you enter and, if applicable, win a Promotion. You should carefully review the rules of each Promotion in which you participate, as they may contain additional important information about our use of Personal Data about you. To the extent that the terms and conditions of such rules concerning the treatment of Personal Data about you conflict with this Privacy Policy, the terms and conditions of such rules shall control. 
  * **Internal Business Purposes.  **   We may also use Personal Data about you for our internal business purposes, such as data analysis, editorial and feedback purposes, providing customer support, customizing and improving the content and layout of the Site, completing business transactions, development of marketing and promotion plans and materials, statistical analysis of user behavior, product development, administering individual accounts, and meeting government regulatory requirements such as sales tax collection, audits, etc. 
  * **Administrative Communications.  **   Subject to applicable law,  we may use Personal Data to send to you important information regarding the Site, your educational services, your account status, changes to the educational services terms and conditions, this Privacy Policy, or any other policies, agreements or transactions relevant to your use of the Site and/or the educational services. Because this information may be important to your use of the Site and/or your educational services, you may continue to receive such communications even if you have elected not to receive some or all of our marketing or other communications, if it is legally permissible for us to communicate with you in the circumstances.



### Collection and Use of Other Data 

Moody's and its Service Providers may also collect the following types of data, referred to in this Privacy Policy as "Other Data": 

  * **Monitoring Data.**   Moody’s and its service providers may collect and/or track other information such as demographic information, domain names, computer type, browser types, screen resolution, and other statistical data involving the use of the Site ("Monitoring Data"). We use Monitoring Data to help us understand who uses the Site and to improve and market it, as well as our other web sites and services.   
Unless combined with Personal Data, Monitoring Data does not personally identify you or any other user, and we may use it for any purpose.     

  * **Aggregated Data.**    Additionally, we may aggregate Personal Data in a manner such that the end-product does not personally identify you or any other user of the Site, for example, by using information to calculate the percentage of our users who have a particular telephone area code. Such aggregate information may also be used for any purpose.  

  * **Cookies.**    To enhance the Internet experience on the Site, Moody's and our service providers may use ‘cookies’ on the Site. Cookies are data that a web server transfers to an individual's computer for recordkeeping and other purposes. We use cookies and other technologies to facilitate users' ongoing access to and use of our Site. If you do not want information collected through the use of cookies, there is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows you to automatically decline cookies, or to be given the choice of declining or accepting the transfer of a particular cookie, or cookies from a particular web site, to your computer. If cookies are disabled, however, all features of the Site may not operate as intended. Information about the procedure you are required to follow in order to disable cookies can be found on your Internet browser provider’s web site. We expect our service providers to honor any decision by you to block or disable cookies in connection with the Site.  

  * **Tools.  **  We and our service providers may also use various common Internet tools such as 'pixel tags,' ‘action tags,’ ‘web beacons,’ ‘.gif tags,’ 'JavaScript' or similar technologies (together, "Tools") in connection with Site pages and email messages in certain formats to, among other things, track the actions of Site users and email recipients, to determine the success of marketing campaigns and to compile statistics about Site usage and response rates. Tools allow us to count users who have visited certain pages of the Site, to deliver branded services, and to help determine the effectiveness of promotional or advertising campaigns. When used in email messages in certain formats, Tools can tell the sender whether and when the email has been opened.  
Moody’s uses cookies and Tool technologies to understand how the Site is used and to customize and enhance the Internet experience of individual users. When you revisit the Site, Moody’s may recognize you by a Tool and customize your experience. For example, once you have completed the registration process, a cookie and/or Tool will be used to avoid having you register again. We believe cookies and Tool technologies add value to the user experience.

Your IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to the computer that you are using by your Internet Service Provider (ISP). This number is identified and logged automatically in our server log files whenever you visit the Site, along with the time(s) of your visit(s) and the page(s) that you visited.
