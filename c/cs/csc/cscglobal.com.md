We encourage you to read those privacy policies carefully when you visit those affiliated sites.

From time to time, we may engage our affiliated entities or other carefully selected third parties to provide services on our behalf, in particular to collect, process, and use your personal data as required to provide services to you.

When using third-party vendors or agents to which CSC intends to transfer personal data, CSC shall perform adequate due diligence to help ensure the security of such information, including ensuring that such third party has entered into a written agreement with CSC requiring the third party to provide at least the same level of privacy protection as is required by the Privacy Shield Framework. CSC shall continue to be liable under the Privacy Shield Principles if third parties to which CSC has transferred personal data for processing on CSC’s behalf do so in a manner that is inconsistent with the Privacy Shield Principles. However, CSC will not be liable if it can prove that it is not responsible for the event that caused damage.

**U.S. - Swiss Safe Harbor Compliance Statement**

**U.S. - Swiss Safe Harbor Compliance Statement for Data Privacy**

At Corporation Service Company (CSC), we recognize the importance of securing the private information of our customers, employees, and business partners, and we strive to safeguard the personal information (defined below) we collect and use. This U.S. - Swiss Safe Harbor Compliance Statement for Data Privacy (Statement) sets out the privacy principles published by the U.S. Department of Commerce as part of the Safe Harbor Framework relating to personal information transferred from Switzerland to the United States.

CSC complies with the U.S. - Swiss Safe Harbor Framework regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information from Switzerland. CSC certifies that it adheres to the U.S. - Swiss Safe Harbor Privacy Principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access, and enforcement. If there is any conflict between the policies in this privacy policy and the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles, the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles shall govern. To learn more about the Safe Harbor program, and to view CSC’s certification, please visit www.export.gov/safeharbor/.

CSC complies with these principles insofar as they are applicable to CSC’s business. CSC shall not be responsible for the compliance of its customers in Switzerland or the data privacy laws and regulations of any country.

**Definitions**

Certain words and phrases are defined within this Statement. In addition, the words set out below have the following meaning:

  * “Personal information” or “personal data” means any information or set of information that identifies an individual, or could be used by or on behalf of CSC to identify an individual. Personal information does not include information which is encrypted or anonymous.



**Seven Safe Harbor privacy principles**

  1. Notice – Companies collecting personal data must notify data subjects that they are collecting their personal data, and state the purpose for collecting such data. The company must identify to whom the data will be disclosed and provide notice about how data subjects can contact the company with complaints or questions and how disclosure of their personal information can be limited.
  2. Choice – The data subjects must be given a clear and conspicuous choice to opt-out of allowing their information to be disclosed to third parties or used for a purpose which is incompatible with the purpose for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized by the individual. For sensitive information, data subjects must be given the affirmative or explicit choice whether their information is given to a third party or purpose other than its original purpose or the purpose authorized subsequently by the individual.
  3. Onward transfer of data to third parties – Where a company or organization wishes to transfer information to a third party, it must apply the “notice” and “choice” principles. Where a company or organization wishes to transfer to a third party acting as agent, it may do so if it first either ascertains that the third party subscribes to the Safe Harbor, is subject to the Swiss or some other qualifying rule, or enters into a written agreement with the third party requiring the third party to provide at least the same level of privacy protection as is required by the Safe Harbor. If a company meets this requirement, it will not be held responsible if the third party handles data in a way contrary to any restrictions or representations, unless the company knew or should have known that the third party would process the data in such a contrary way and took no reasonable steps to prevent or stop such activity. As an alternative, the organization can enter into a written agreement with the third party requiring that the third party provide at least the same level of privacy protection as is required by these principles.
  4. Access – Companies must allow data subjects to access their personal data and to correct erroneous information, unless the burden of providing access is greater than the risks associated with the erroneous information or giving access to the information would violate another person’s rights. This requirement is subject to the reasonableness standard. In the event a data subject corrects their personal data, the Company will ensure such changes are updated in the corresponding records storage at CSC.
  5. Security – Companies must take reasonable measures to protect personal information from tampering, destruction, loss, misuse, alteration, disclosure, unauthorized access, and any other potential abuses.
  6. Data integrity – Companies collecting personal data must have reasonable procedures designed to keep the information reliable, accurate, complete, current, and relevant for the lawful purposes for which it was collected.
  7. Enforcement – Three elements are required to satisfy this principle: (a) readily affordable and independent recourse mechanisms so that each individual’s complaints and disputes can be investigated and resolved, and damages awarded where the applicable law or private sector initiatives so provide; (b) procedures for verifying that the commitments companies make to adhere to the Safe Harbor Principles have been implemented; and (c) obligations to remedy problems arising out of failure to comply with the principles. Sanctions must be sufficiently rigorous to ensure compliance by the organization.



In compliance with the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Principles, CSC commits to resolve complaints about your privacy and our collection or use of your personal information. Swiss citizens with inquiries or complaints regarding this privacy policy should first contact CSC at [InformationSecurity@cscglobal.com](mailto:InformationSecurity@cscglobal.com).

CSC has further committed to refer unresolved privacy complaints under the U.S. - Swiss Safe Harbor to an independent dispute resolution mechanism operated by the Council of Better Business Bureaus. If you do not receive timely acknowledgement of your complaint, or if your complaint is not satisfactorily addressed, please visit www.bbb.org/us/safe-harbor-complaints for more information and to file a complaint.

With regard to unresolved privacy complaints involving human resources data, CSC will cooperate and comply with the advice of the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner regarding employee data of Swiss citizens collected in the context of the employment relationship.

See https://www.cscglobal.com/service/csc/privacy for details of:

  * CSC’s information handling practices regarding personal information and the choices that CSC offers individuals with respect to the use and disclosure of their personal information;
  * CSC’s accountability for personal information that it receives under the Privacy Shield and subsequently transfers to a third party (and in particular for details of CSC’s continued liability under the Privacy Shield Principles where it transfers personal information onwards to a third party for processing on CSC’s behalf); and
  * CSC’s chosen Independent Recourse Mechanism for the investigation of unresolved complaints regarding CSC’s compliance with the Privacy Shield Framework and Principles, including contact details for such Independent Recourse Mechanism.
