# AAA - Privacy Policy

**Introduction:**

Depending on what you do when you visit any Web site, you are providing information about your visit to the site's owners. This includes the Web site maintained by the California State Automobile Association at csaa.com. We value privacy and think you do too, so we want you to have the information you need to make your own decisions about your personal privacy. When you visit or supply information to any Web site, we think it's a good idea for you to first understand what that site's privacy policies are. If the site doesn't tell you, don't hesitate to ask. 

The bottom line for the CSAA site is that we use the information that we get from your visit for internal tracking purposes, to make the CSAA site as useful and interesting to you as we can, and to respond to your requests for information or other services and to advise you of services and products. Except as specifically noted below or in the 

_CSAA Web Site Terms, Conditions and Notices_ ("Terms"), we do not use your personal information for any other purpose, and we never sell it to any third party.
