**Privacy Law**  
Federal law requires banks and insurers to inform consumers about the personal information they collect and share with others. This notice is given under that law by California State Automobile Association (CSAA), California State Automobile Association Inter-Insurance Bureau and Western United Insurance Company.

**What Information We Collect**  
We collect personal information from you when you apply for Membership, such as your name, address and telephone number. We collect additional information, such as your driving record or information about your home, from you and from others if you apply for insurance. We also collect information on the use of services, such as Emergency Road Service or purchases using Member discounts. In addition, we buy information from other companies to help us understand which products or services would benefit our Members.

**Web Site Information**  
Depending on what you do when you visit any web site, you are providing information about your visit to the site's owners. This includes the web site maintained by CSAA at csaa.com.

At csaa.com, we use the information that we get from your visit for internal tracking purposes, to make the CSAA site as useful and interesting to you as we can, to respond to your requests for information or other services, and to advise you of services and products. Except as noted in the [Web Site Privacy Specifics](http://www.csaa.com/global/websiteprivacypolicy/0,8061,,00.html) or in the [CSAA Web Site Terms, Conditions and Notices](http://www.csaa.com/global/termsconditions/0,8056,,00.html) ("Terms"), we do not use your personal information for any other purpose.

We share personal information with affiliates and with companies we have retained to provide services for us. We also share personal information with carefully selected financial institutions to offer products and services to you. Other than that, we share personal information concerning Members only as may be required or authorized by law. We also provide some services to customers who are not Members. We collect personal information concerning these customers just as we do for Members, but we do not share their personal information except as may be required or authorized by law. We do not share information concerning former Members with anyone except as may be required or authorized by law.
