# ProQuest - Privacy Policy

**Your Privacy**  
ProQuest LLC ("ProQuest") and its business units value your privacy and take precautions to protect the personal information you provide us from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction. In the registration, trial request and product bulletin subscription systems, we ask you to provide contact information including your name, address, email address and phone number. We store this personal information in databases that we use to deliver the requested products to you.

**Use of Your Personal Information**  
When you register, we ask whether you want to receive periodic updates about our new products. We put your name on a mailing list for future product announcements only if you indicate that you want us to do so. If you contact us through our web site and request information, we use the contact information you provide only for the stated purpose. Only a limited number of authorized employees have access to the information you provide. We will disclose your personal information if we are required to do so by law or legal process. Your personal information will be used only for the purposes stated above, will not be shared with third parties other than those described above and will not be sold to third parties.

Upon registration, we request your birth date for the purpose of determining age, so that we may distinguish users under the age of 13 ("Pre-Teen Users") from users age 13 or older. However, as part of our compliance with COPPA, we do not collect other information that would allow us to associate the birth date with any particular child. Instead, we register Pre-Teen Users with only a User-selected, unique user name and password. We do not knowingly grant Pre-Teen Users access to any services that gather their personal information.

**Viewing and Correcting Your Personal Information**  
You can update your personal information at any time by clicking the user profile link on your My Products page. Your My Products page is displayed when you log in.

**How We Use Cookie Technology**  
The ProQuest information products use cookie technology to initiate and maintain your session connections and to compile aggregated statistics about web site usage. The cookie stores encrypted information verifying your access to the system. In no case is it used to access personal information, nor is the session information maintained in the cookie made available to other organizations.

**What Happens if the Company is Sold**  
If ProQuest, or its business units, were to merge with or be acquired by another organization, the database of customer information would be one of the assets acquired.

**Changes to the Privacy Policy**  
ProQuest and its bigchalk business unit may occasionally revise this Privacy Policy. Changes to the Privacy Policy will appear on this page.
