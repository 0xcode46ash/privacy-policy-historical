# Comcast SportsNet New England - Privacy Policy

Privacy Policy

Comcast Sports Management Services, LLC (“SportsNet”), on behalf of its subsidiaries Comcast SportsNet Philadelphia, L.P., Comcast SportsNet Mid-Atlantic, L.P., Comcast SportsNet Chicago, LLC and Comcast SportsNet West, Inc., through the comcastsportsnet.com Website, focuses on delivering sports news and information to our Internet users in the different markets we serve.  SportsNet is similarly focused on respecting and protecting the privacy of its users. This policy statement tells you how we collect information from you and how we use it.  When you access the comcastsportsnet.com Website, we recognize you may be entrusting us with personally identifiable information and we are committed to honoring that trust by working to safeguard your privacy.  This Privacy Policy describes the principles that govern our information practices and other privacy aspects of the comcastsportsnet.com Website. 

In this Privacy Policy, we refer to information that specifically identifies you as “personally identifiable information.”  This Privacy Policy applies only to information collected by SportsNet online and does not apply to information collected or obtained by SportsNet by any other means.

SportsNet’s Security Measures  
Since even the best Privacy Policy doesn’t mean much if your information isn’t safe, SportsNet uses industry standard physical and electronic procedures (including firewalls) to protect your personally identifiable information.  Digital certificates encrypt data using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology, the industry standard method for protecting web communications.  The SSL security protocol provides data encryption, server authentication, message integrity, and optional client authentication for a TCP/IP connection.  SSL has been universally accepted on the Internet for authenticated and encrypted communication between members’ computers and our servers.  SSL ensures that information exchanged between your computers and our servers over the 

Internet is secure and can’t be accessed by third parties. The Information SportsNet Collects and How It Is Used

Collection of Personally Identifiable Information  
When using the comcastsportsnet.com Website, you may be asked to provide various types of personally identifiable information to enhance your experience on our site.  For example, the comcastsportsnet.com Website asks for personally identifiable information such as your name, address, zip code, phone number, and e-mail address when you enter a contest, post a question, or participate in a promotion.  You can always go back to read this Privacy Policy by clicking on the Privacy Policy link on the bottom of all of the pages on the comcastsportsnet.com Website.  Please also see below about “cookies” and what other information is collected.

Children’s Privacy  
Simply stated, SportsNet does not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13.  If we learn that we have collected personal information on a child under the age of 13, we will delete that data from our systems.  SportsNet encourages parents and guardians to go online with their children and suggests the following to help make a child’s online experience safer:

    * Teach children never to give personal information (such as name, address, phone number, school, etc.) unless supervised by a parent or responsible adult.  
    * Know the sites your children are visiting and which sites are appropriate.  
    * Look for website privacy policies. Know how your child’s information is treated.

Use of Personally Identifiable Information  
Generally, the only people who have access to your personally identifiable information are SportsNet employees and these employees may use this personally identifiable information to take actions such as:

    * Help provide you with the ability to create personal profile areas;  
    * Provide customer feedback, service and support;  
    * Support and run contests, sweepstakes or other marketing or promotional activities on the comcastsportsnet.com Website;  
    * Conduct questionnaires and surveys in order to provide better products and services to our customers;  
    * To understand more about you, so we can personalize newsletters and websites to your preferences;  
    * To enhance your web browsing experience and help personalize the comcastsportsnet.com Website for your viewing preferences;  
    * To allow you to forward information to another individual such as a friend or co-worker. SportsNet does not store the personal information about the third party to whom you forward such information; we only collect the information for the sole purpose of sending a one-time email. If you choose to use our referral service to inform a colleague or friend, we will only ask for a contact name and email address; and  
    * To meet contractual obligations.

Please note that you are responsible for protecting any user name(s) and password(s) that provide you with access to the comcastsportsnet.com Website. 

SportsNet disclaims any responsibility for a breach of privacy as a result of your willingly or inadvertently disclosing user name(s) and password(s) to others.

Registration and Purchase Information.  We also may use your email address to send you informational emails, such as news, information about contests or 

promotions, or changes or enhancements to the comcastsportsnet.com Website. If you don’t want to receive these informational email communications, please refer to the Opt-Out Policy below.

Co-Branded Offers  
In arranging to have marketing and promotional information of certain companies or businesses with whom SportsNet may have formed a strategic alliance (“Affiliated Companies”), we may disclose to the Affiliated Companies your personally identifiable information, including information such as your address, billing information, telephone number and credit card information. If you do not want to us to disclose your personally identifiable information to the Affiliated Companies, please refer to the Opt-Out Policy below.

Third-Party Offers  
 In arranging to have marketing and promotional information of third-party companies that we think might be of interest to you, we may disclose your personal information, including information such as your address, billing information, telephone number and credit card information to nonaffiliated third parties not controlled by SportsNet.  If you do not want to us to disclose your personal information to third-party companies, please refer to the Opt-Out Policy below.

Aggregate Information  
On an aggregate basis only, we collect comprehensive demographic information and data, and other non-identifying information about users of the comcastsportsnet.com Website.  SportsNet will never disclose any personally identifiable information as part of this aggregate information but we may lend, sell, share or otherwise disclose aggregate information with others so we can perform research and provide the results to third parties, enhance and market the comcastsportsnet.com Website, and conduct accounting and process record keeping functions.

Cookies and IP Address Information  
SportsNet uses a feature of your browser called a “cookie.”  Your cookie automatically identifies your computer - but not you - to our servers when you visit the comcastsportsnet.com Website and allows us to correlate your computer with certain usage patterns which are stored in our log files.  We use cookies to gather general, aggregate statistics about the overall usage of the comcastsportsnet.com Website in our continual attempt to improve our products and services.  SportsNet also uses temporary cookies, often referred to as session cookies, to keep a user logged into the system and aid in the exchange of information between pages without loss of data.  Such a cookie, however, is only stored for the current browsing session and is deleted once the browser is closed.  SportsNet can only read cookies from the comcastsportsnet.com Website.  Search for Cookies under your Web browser’s Help menu for more information on cookie management features available to you.  If your browser is set to reject all cookies, the comcastsportsnet.com Website may not function properly. 

Additionally, we may use IP address information to count and track aggregate visits to the comcastsportsnet.com Website, to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer the comcastsportsnet.com Website.  SportsNet does not link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable so while a particular user’s session can be tracked, the user remains completely anonymous.

Clear Gifs  
We also may collect information through the use of clear gifs (also called Web Beacons and Web Bugs) in selected email messages we send you. These are tiny graphic files, not visible to the human eye, that are included in HTML-based emails and used to let us know which emails we send are opened.  Clear gifs may also see or read cookies on your computer.  When authorized by SportsNet, third parties specializing in monitoring aggregate statistical use of our site with whom we contract, may use cookies, our web log files, web beacons, and other monitoring technologies to compile anonymous aggregate data.

Privacy Policy Coverage and Links to Other Sites  
We may include links to other websites we think may be of interest to you or operated by our business partners, affiliates, advertisers and others. These third parties have separate data collection and privacy practices independent from ours, and SportsNet cannot be responsible for their policies or activities. Please contact those third parties directly if you have questions about their privacy policies.

Changes to Our Privacy Policy  
We encourage you to review our Privacy Policy not just the first time you visit the comcastsportsnet.com Website but periodically afterwards since we may modify our Privacy Policy from time to time.  The date of the last update of the Privacy Policy will always be posted below:

THIS PRIVACY POLICY WAS LAST REVISED ON JANUARY 25, 2007.

If we make any substantive changes to our Privacy Policy in the future with regard to how we use your personally identifiable information, we will incorporate those changes here.  Your continued use of the comcastsportsnet.com Website after the changes are posted constitutes your agreement to the changes, both with regard to information we have previously collected from you and with regard to information we collect from you in the future. If you do not agree to the changes, please discontinue use of the comcastsportsnet.com Website.  Lastly, if SportsNet is sold or merged with another company, your personally identifiable information will be included as part of the sale but unless you’re notified that the Privacy Policy is changed, your personally identifiable information will be maintained in the same manner.

Accessing and Updating Information  
To access or update the personally identifiable information that SportsNet may have, please send an email to csnwebmaster@comcastsportsnet.com with your request.   Please include your email address and indicate the nature of your request or the information you wish to change. In addition, you may delete the cookie stored on your computer, which will cause our system to perceive you as a new user with no known user data. You may also set your browser to reject cookies, but doing so may prevent you from using some of our services.  There may be certain instances when SportsNet may not be able to respond, such as when access would violate the privacy of another individual, when access is prohibited by law, or when the personally identifiable information has been lawfully obtained from third party sources.
