Sometimes it may be necessary to collect sensitive information. If you provide Rinker with sensitive information, it is Rinker's policy that this information will be used and disclosed only for the purpose for which it was provided or another directly related purpose, unless you agree otherwise, or unless use or disclosure of this information is allowed by law.

The way we use tax file numbers and information received from a credit reporting agency about an individual is also restricted by law.
