Privacy Policy

CSX Corporation is committed to Internet privacy and information security. In general, you can visit us on the World Wide Web without telling us who you are or revealing any information about yourself. Our web servers collect the IP addresses, not the e-mail addresses, of visitors. This information is aggregated to measure the number of visits, average time spent on the site, pages viewed, etc. We use this information to measure the use of our site and to improve the content of our site. 

There are times, however, when we may need information from you, such as your name, e-mail address, and mailing address. Usually, we use the information we collect to respond to your inquiry, process an order, or allow you to access specific account information. We will not share your information with anyone other than CSX Corp.'s subsidiaries or affiliates. 

If you register with one of CSX Corp.'s subsidiaries or affiliates on-line, they may use this information to provide you with customized information about offerings that support your specific business needs. A technology called "cookies" may be used to provide you with such customized information. A cookie is a tiny element of data that a web site can send to your browser, which may then be stored on your computer's hard drive so we can recognize you when you return. You may set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie. 

At times we conduct on-line surveys to better understand our visitors' needs. When we conduct a survey, we will let you know how we will use your information at the time we collect it.

We do not send unsolicited e-mail. After you provide us with personal information, you may receive Service Bulletins, electronic newsletters, or other materials of interest to you via e-mail from CSX Corp. or its subsidiaries or affiliates. 

You may easily unsubscribe to future e-mailings by using any of the following methods:
