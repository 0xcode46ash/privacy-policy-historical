# CSX Corporation: About Us: Company Information & History: Privacy Policy

|  |  **CSX Corporation is** sensitive to privacy issues on the Internet. We believe it is important you know how we treat the information about you we receive on the Internet. 

In general, you can visit CSX on the World Wide Web without telling us who you are or revealing any information about yourself. Our web servers collect the domain names, not the e-mail addresses, of visitors. This information is aggregated to measure the number of visits, average time spent on the site, pages viewed, etc. CSX uses this information to measure the use of our site and to improve the content of our site. 

There are times, however, when we may need information from you, such as your name and address. When information is needed, we will try to let you know at the time of collection, how we will use the personal information. Usually, the personal information we collect is used only by us to respond to your inquiry, process an order or allow you to access specific account information. We will not make the e-mail addresses, of those who provide information, available to other organizations. 

If you register with one of CSX’s business units on-line, they may use this information to provide you with custom information about CSX’s offering in support of your business needs. A technology called cookies may be used to provide you with tailored information. A cookie is a tiny element of data that a web site can send to your browser, which may then be stored on your hard drive so we can recognize you when you return. You may set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie. 

At times we conduct on-line surveys to better understand the needs and profile of our visitors. When we conduct a survey, we will let you know how we will use the information at the time we collect information from you on the Internet. 

CSX’s website may contain links to other sites such as government organizations and affiliates. While we try to link only to sites that share our high standards and respect for privacy, we are not responsible for the content or the privacy practices employed by other sites.
