Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory collects information from our users at several different points on our website.

**Links**

A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's hard drive containing information about the user. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on our site. Once the user closes their browser, the cookie simply terminates. For instance, by setting a cookie on our site, the user would not have to log in a password more than once, thereby saving time while on our site.

**Care in Using Forums**   
Community communication features such the Memory Baord are at the heart of the community experience at CSHL. Visitors who wish to use these tools should be aware that disclosing personally identifiable information online makes the information public information. Such disclosure may increase a user's chance of receiving "spam" or unsolicited email from unscrupulous users.

We strongly recommend that users take extra care to use discretion when disclosing information online in chat rooms or forums. In the future, CSHL will be adding new components to the site in order to further safeguard visitors' information.
