**CSUMENTOR PRIVACY POLICY AND ITS EXCEPTIONS**  
Except as set forth below, the personally identifiable data you submit to CSUMentor is not made available or distributed to third parties, except with your express consent and at your direction. In particular, CSUMentor and Xap Corporation (Xap, the company that operates CSUMentor on behalf of CSU) will not give, sell or provide access to your personal information to any company, individual or organization for its use in marketing or commercial solicitation or for any other purpose, except as is necessary for the operation of this site. 

**Exceptions to the Privacy Policy**  
There are limited exceptions to the CSUMentor privacy policy. When required by law to comply with any valid legal process such as a search warrant, subpoena, statute, regulation or court order, CSU or Xap will supply such information contained in your CSUMentor account as that organization reasonably determines, based on the advice of counsel, it is legally required to supply. In addition, CSU or Xap may release specific information relevant to special cases, such as a physical threat to you or others or an attempted breach of security on the CSUMentor site.

**THE PERSONAL IDENTIFYING INFORMATION WE COLLECT**  
CSUMentor collects personal identifying information from you including your name, date of birth, address, e-mail address, telephone number, grade level and such additional information as you are required to provide by the college and financial aid applications that you choose to complete. 

**REASONS WE COLLECT YOUR PERSONAL IDENTIFYING INFORMATION**  
CSUMentor collects personal information from you for two reasons. The first reason is to enable CSUMentor to respond to your questions or contact you when necessary in connection with the functioning of CSUMentor. The second reason is to perform a task, such as filling out a college application, requested by you. When the effective functioning of a CSUMentor module does not require personal information, none is collected, and any such module can be accessed without opening an account or providing any personal data. 

When you log on to CSUMentor, your browser will automatically transmit to CSUMentor's server the IP address of your computer and type of browser you are using. Although your browser transmits the IP address of your computer, CSUMentor does not associate this IP address with any personally identifiable information regarding you. CSUMentor does not collect any personally identifiable information other than what users submit and their browsers transmit.

**MINIMUM AGE OF 13 REQUIRED TO ESTABLISH AN ACCOUNT**  
CSUMentor will not collect any information from persons who are not yet 13 years old. If you are under 13 years of age, you will not be permitted to create an account on CSUMentor. Regardless of your age, you can still use most of CSUMentor to learn more about CSU campuses.

If you are 13 years of age or older, you are encouraged to create an account on CSUMentor and to utilize all of CSUMentor, which will help you plan, prepare and pay for your future education.

**WAYS IN WHICH PERSONAL IDENTIFYING INFORMATION MAY BE USED**  
CSUMentor will use your personal identifying information, when you select the corresponding function, to automatically fill out the following forms:

  * Applications for admission 
  * The federal financial aid application used for federal and state aid programs 
  * Freshman and transfer planners, which can assist you in selecting courses and otherwise planning to meet admission requirements 
  * Requests for information or material from colleges or other institutions you specify 



Your personal identifying information may also be used for the following purposes:

  * We may use your identifying information to help diagnose problems with CSUMentor's server and to administer the CSUMentor website. 
  * Summary data representing a compilation of aggregate data representing CSUMentor users may be collected by Xap and provided to CSU, which may provide such data to various colleges and other educational institutions represented on CSUMentor. No personal identifying information is made available as part of these summary reports. Some examples of summary data are the number of monthly visitors to the site, the number of admission applications submitted over CSUMentor, and the CSUMentor functions utilized by students in specified age ranges. 



**WITH WHOM PERSONAL IDENTIFYING INFORMATION MAY BE SHARED**  
In each of the circumstances described below, data specifically required to perform a task you request will be made available to a recipient 

_you designate_

:

  * If you submit an application for admission to a college or other educational institution, the personal data required to complete that application will be provided on your behalf to the admissions office of the institution to which you are applying. 
  * If you start an application for admission to a college or other educational institution, your name and other data entered on that application may be provided to the admissions office of that institution, even though you have not yet submitted that application to that institution. 
  * If you request that your data be transferred to FAFSA-on-the-Web to help you fill out your federal financial aid application, data relevant to that application will be provided to a processor specified and authorized to process your financial aid applications (FAFSA) by the U.S. Department of Education. 
  * If you request that a college or other educational institution send you material, your contact information will be provided to that institution. 



**SECURITY MEASURES TO PREVENT MISUSE OF INFORMATION ENTRUSTED TO CSUMENTOR**  
CSUMentor enables the data you input to be encrypted when in route between your browser and the CSUMentor server and when in route between the CSUMentor server and some other browser or server. This practice helps prevent unauthorized third parties from intercepting and gaining access to your private data during transmission over the Internet. CSUMentor uses 40-bit, Secure Socket Layer encryption supported by both Netscape's and Microsoft's browsers. 

Data residing on the CSUMentor server is password protected, and access is provided only to those employees of Xap who require such access to administer and maintain the CSUMentor system or to provide requested customer support to users of CSUMentor. Each Xap employee who has access to the data residing on the CSUMentor server has agreed in writing to respect the privacy of all such personal data. 

**COOKIES**  
A cookie is a small file that a website transfers to a user's computer, which may then be stored on its hard drive. CSUMentor uses cookies to remember you and personalize your web-viewing experience by keeping track of your session when logged on to CSUMentor. Cookies enable you to maintain continuity as you move from page to page on CSUMentor and to avoid the nuisance of being asked to provide the same information repeatedly. Cookies also allow us to make sure that only your browser can exchange information regarding your account with our servers. Cookies cannot be used to steal personal information or to gain access to information that you did not directly provide. The cookies we use are set when you log on to CSUMentor and are erased when you log off CSUMentor or completely close your browser. 

Don't want cookies?  
Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies. If you don't want cookies, you can set your browser to disable or refuse cookies or to alert you when cookies are being used. You should note, however, that various CSUMentor services might not function properly when cookies are not utilized. 

**LINKS**  
CSUMentor hosts links to other sites having privacy policies that may differ from those of CSUMentor. CSU and Xap are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of any websites to which CSUMentor links. 

**CHANGING AND DELETING YOUR INFORMATION**  
You may update, otherwise change or delete from the data stored on CSUMentor any personal information you previously provided. To modify personal information, (i) log on to CSUMentor, (ii) access either your user profile or an application containing the information you want to change, and (iii) modify that information using standard word-processing techniques. To delete personal information, (i) log on to CSUMentor, (ii) access your user profile, and (iii) delete the information you want to remove from CSUMentor using standard word-processing techniques. Please recognize that if you delete information, it will no longer be available on CSUMentor so that, for example, if a college to which you previously submitted an application were to attempt to retrieve that application from CSUMentor after you made the deletion the deleted information would no longer be accessible. Similarly, when accessed over CSUMentor information that has been updated or otherwise modified will appear in its then-most current form, rather than in the form in which it may have been submitted at some earlier time.

You cannot change information on an application that has already been submitted to a campus. Please contact the campus that has already received your application to find out how to change information already submitted.
