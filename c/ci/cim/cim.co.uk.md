In some circumstances we may be unable to provide you with your personal data, for example, if it compromises the confidentiality of a third party e.g. we are unable to provide candidates with copies of their marked examination scripts. However, The Institute offers a comprehensive examination feedback service (for details please contact our [membership services team](https://web.archive.org/home.aspx?contact=mem "Contact our membership services team").
