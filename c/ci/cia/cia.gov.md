# Central Intelligence Agency

The Director of Central Intelligence heads both the U.S. Intelligence Community and the Central Intelligence Agency. As a result of these dual roles, this Web site includes information about both the Intelligence Community (see the [DCI's welcome page](https://web.archive.org/dci/index.html)) and the Central Intelligence Agency . For the purpose of the notices which follow, we will refer to this entire Web site as the Central Intelligence Agency Web site since 'Central Intelligence Agency' is a more widely known name than is 'Director of Central Intelligence.' The notices which follow apply equally to all areas of this Web site.

###  Privacy Notice

> 
> The Central Intelligence Agency Web site automatically logs visitor information from which summary statistics are created. We use the summary statistics to help us make our site more useful to visitors, such as assessing what information is of most and least interest to visitors, and for other purposes such as determining the site's technical design specifications and identifying system performance or problem areas.

The only exception to this policy is described in our Security notice below.

> The authority for soliciting your Social Security Number (SSN) is Executive Order 9397\. Since other people may have the same name and birth date, your SSN will be used to identify you precisely. Although disclosure of your SSN is not mandatory, your failure to do so will impede completion of your application.

### Cookies

The Central Intelligence Agency Web site does **NOT** use the "cookies" that some Web sites use to gather and store information about your visits to their sites. 

Cookies are essentially tokens of information, such as preferences and passwords, that some Web servers collect from you when you access them. That data is stored on your hard drive—not on the Web site's server. Whenever you visit a "cookie" site, the server looks for its cookie on your hard drive and, if found, then reads the information it stored there. Cookies generally are stored in your browser's directory or folder in a file named cookie.txt (MagicCookie on a Macintosh).
