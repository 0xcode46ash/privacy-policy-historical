###  Cookies

A cookie is a text file placed on the hard drive of a computer by some Web pages or Web servers. Cookies cannot run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. They are uniquely assigned to a visitor and can only be read by a Web server in the domain that issued the cookie. Visitors can accept cookies (generally their browser's default setting) or decline them through their browser settings. Persistent cookies remain on a computer's hard drive until the visitor deletes them. Session cookies are deleted automatically when the visitor closes his or her browser. 

In compliance with Office of Management and Budget policy, the Central Intelligence Agency Web site does not set **persistent cookies** on visitors' computers. However, the CIA Careers section of the CIA website does set session cookies on visitors' computers to support a survey that visitors may be asked to complete. 

CIA has arranged for ForeSee Results to conduct a visitor survey to help CIA recruiters evaluate the usefulness of the CIA Careers page to visitors. ForeSee Results' survey mechanism uses a **session cookie** — automatically deleted when the visitor closes his or her browser — to track how many pages each visitor to the CIA Careers website views. A percentage of visitors who view a certain number of pages are offered an opportunity to complete a brief survey Foresee Results uses this technique to ensure a visitor has viewed a sufficient number of pages to adequately answer the survey and to ensure a visitor is not presented the survey multiple times during a single browser session. Neither the CIA nor Foresee Results collects personal information from visitors completing the survey nor will either track any visitor once they have left the CIA Careers website.
