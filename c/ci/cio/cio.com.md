All E-mail mailing lists maintained by CIO contain the names of people who requested to receive information from us. CIO may use such information for marketing and promotional purposes and may share the information with companies that it has pre-screened. Individuals always have the ability to stop their information being used for such purposes by sending an e-mail request to [denisep@cio.com](mailto:denisep@cio.com).

A user's personally identifying information will not be transferred to any other party unless otherwise stated at the time of collection.

CIO.COM users should be aware that when they voluntarily disclose personal information (e.g., user name, e-mail address) on the CIO Discussion Areas, that information can be collected and used by others and may result in unsolicited messages from other posters or parties. 

Users can send e-mail to us at [thorgan@cio.com](mailto:thorgan@cio.com) with any further questions.
