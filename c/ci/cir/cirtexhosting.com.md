We are committed to ensuring that we respect and protect our customers’ privacy. This Privacy Policy describes what personal information of our customers (“Customers”) and visitors to the HostNine website (“Visitors”) (collectively, “Users”) is collected and how and when it might be used or shared by HostNine.

Who We Are

HostNine provides a variety of web presence solutions and related services (the “Services”). HostNine is a part of The Endurance International Group, Inc. (“Endurance”). [Learn more about the Endurance corporate family.](http://endurance.com/)

The information that HostNine collects in connection with the Services is hosted on servers located in the United States (U.S.) unless otherwise provided, and may be processed or accessed outside of the European Economic Area countries by us or our service providers. By using the Services, you freely and expressly give HostNine your consent to export your information and data outside of the European Economic Area.

Information We Collect

We collect information in different ways from Users who utilize our Services, the network of websites accessible through our Services, or visit the HostNine website.

  * **Non-Personally Identifying Information**. When Users visit the HostNine website, HostNine collects non-personally-identifying information including the browser type, IP address, geographic location, language preference, referring site, metadata about the User’s use, the pages the User views and the date and time of each visit to the HostNine website.
  * **Personally Identifying Information**. Personally identifying information is any information that identifies you or would enable someone to contact you, which may include your name, email address, phone number and other non-public information that is associated with such information. It does not include aggregate information, anonymous information or any other non-personally identifiable information. The amount and type of personally identifying information that HostNine gathers depends on the nature of the interaction with the User. For example, we ask Visitors who choose to sign up for our newsletter for their name and email address while Customers are asked to provide additional information to process their purchases. HostNine may ask Customers to provide additional information beyond what was requested during their initial purchase if HostNine determines it is necessary to verify your identity or reduce fraud. HostNine does not disclose personally identifying information other than as described herein.
  * **Aggregated Statistics**. HostNine may collect statistics about a Customer’s use of the Services. For example, HostNine may collect the number of emails sent per month through the Services.



Use of Information

We use the information we collect to provide the Services and as discussed in this section.

  * **Non-Personally Identifying Information**. HostNine collects non-personally identifying information to better understand how Visitors use the HostNine website. HostNine may use aggregated and non-identifying information to promote advertisements that appear on the HostNine website and in connection with the Services.
  * **Personally Identifying Information**. The information collected from Customers is used to manage each Customer’s account and to promote other products or services that we believe may be of interest to the Customer. HostNine may also generate aggregate profiles from information that Customers provide during registration or subsequently as may be requested by HostNine (e.g. through customer surveys or additional services).
  * **Emails**. If you have provided HostNine with your email address, HostNine may send you emails to tell you about new products or services, solicit your feedback, inform you of an outage or interruption in service, or just to keep you up to date with what's going on with HostNine and our products and services. If you send us a support request, we reserve the right to remove all personally identifiable information and publish such request on our website to help us support other Users.

  * **Domain Registration**. In certain jurisdictions or pursuant to the rules of the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers ("ICANN") or certain registries, the contact information you provide to register a domain name ("Domain Name Registration Information") has to be made available and accessible to the public through a "WHOIS" search. The WHOIS database is a publicly accessible database that lists the Domain Name Registration Information for a particular domain name, the name server(s) to which the domain name points, and the domain name's creation and expiration date. The Domain Name Registration Information you provide is hosted by us or a third party service provider and is made available to the public through WHOIS searches. At times, Customers may receive solicitations that result from searches of the publicly available WHOIS database by other companies or individuals. Any such solicitations or SPAM do not come from us and we do not control the use of WHOIS information by third parties. We may also deposit your Domain Name Registration Information with a third-party escrow provider to comply with ICANN requirements.
