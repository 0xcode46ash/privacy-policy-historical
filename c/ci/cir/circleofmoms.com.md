## Privacy Policy

This privacy statement (“Privacy Policy”) covers the Circle of Moms service (the “Service”) which is offered by  the  MGEL, Inc. (the “Company”) via our site,  [ http://www.circleofmoms.com](http://www.circleofmoms.com/) and through our Facebook application,  [ http://apps.facebook.com/circleofmoms](http://apps.facebook.com/circleofmoms). References to “MGEL”, “we”, “us” and “our” herein refer to MGEL, Inc.

We know that you care about how your personal information is used and shared, and we take your privacy seriously. Please read the following to learn more about our privacy policy. By using the Service, you are accepting the practices outlined in this Privacy Policy. We collect user information in an effort to improve your experience and to communicate with you about our services and promotions. This Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of companies that we do not own or control, to people whom we do not employ or manage or to third party websites. We do not sell or rent your personal information to third parties. As described in this Privacy Policy, we may, however, share your information under certain circumstances, including with third parties (“marketing partners”) that provide services on our behalf or with whom we have collaborated to offer a particular service. Currently, there are not any partners with whom we will share your information. We reserve the right, however, to add, remove or change our marketing partners from time to time. 

## What kind of information do we collect?

Information Explicitly Granted by Social Network Platforms. If you access the Service on a “social network platform” (including but not limited to Facebook, MySpace, Hi5 and Bebo), we will access and store the information explicitly allowed for by the social network platform in their Terms of Service once you explicitly allow us to do so through an interface provided by the social network platform.  As we do not have control over the user interface provided by social network platforms, we do not take any responsibility for any changes or problems with the interface or exchange of information provided by any of these social network platforms.

User Provided Information. We collect personal information from you when you register with us, update your profile, interact with other Service members (“Users”), and use our various features. To register with us, you must follow one of two scenarios.  First, you can provide your name, birthday, and email address. When you submit this information, we will send you a confirmation email to which you must respond in order to complete the registration process. Second, you can add our application on a social network platform.  Once you are registered, you will be given the option to add additional personal information about you and your family to your profile. By using the privacy settings on your profile, you can control which Users have access to certain of your personal profile data. Keep in mind, however, that certain basic profile data cannot be hidden and will always be displayed by us once you register, including your username. 

We may also collect information regarding your interaction with other Users and your use of the Service. From time to time we may ask you to respond to surveys or other requests for information and we collect the information you provide. We may collect information from you when you participate in sweepstakes and promotions offered through the Service. We may also collect information about you through other methods, including research surveys or information we obtain from third parties, including verification services, data services, as well as public sources. We use this information to continually offer you the most value as a user of the Service.

All personally identifiable information that we collect may become part of your user file and may be used by us as provided in this Privacy Policy or as disclosed at the time you provide the information or as otherwise agreed by you.

Disclosure of Your Information.  We will not rent or sell your personal information to other companies or individuals, unless we have your consent. We may use or disclose such information in any of the following limited circumstances: 

• We have your consent.

• We need to enforce our Terms of Service and/or the social network platform’s terms of service.

• We provide such information to trusted businesses or persons for the sole purpose of processing personally identifying information on our behalf. When this is done, it is subject to agreements that oblige those parties to process such information only on our instructions and in compliance with this Privacy Policy and appropriate confidentiality and security measures.

• We provide such information to third parties who have entered into non-disclosure agreements with us.

• We provide such information to marketing partners.

• We provide such information to a company controlled by, or under common control with, MGEL for any purpose permitted by this Privacy Policy.

• We respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims.

• We believe it is necessary to share personal information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of our Terms of Service, a social network platform’s terms of service or as otherwise required by law.

• We transfer personal information about you if MGEL is, or its assets are, acquired by or merged with another company.

Aggregate Data.  We collect information from all visitors to the Service. This information may include the browser you are using, the Internet address from which you linked to the Service, the operating system of your computer, the unique IP address of the computer you used to access the Service, and usage and browsing habits. We use this information to help diagnose and troubleshoot server malfunctions, to analyze trends, track user movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information. We may also use individual information we collect through web logs to send you targeted offers and other communications. We may share aggregated information with others without further notice. An example of this would be the number of people who used the Service in a given month. We reserve the right to send you certain communications relating to the Service, such as announcements and administrative messages, without offering you the opportunity to opt-out of receiving them. 

Cookies.  To help make sure you receive information that is relevant to you, our Site uses data “cookies.” These cookies are small data files stored on your computer which identify you as a previous visitor to the Site and help us to personalize your experience when you arrive. MGEL and its ad management partners (“Ad Partners”) use cookies to record current session information. 

Our Ad Partners may also from time to time use web beacons (also known as Internet tags, pixel tags and clear GIFs). These web beacons are provided by our Ad Partners and allow Ad Partners to obtain information such as the IP address of the computer that downloaded the page on which the beacon appears, the URL of the page on which the beacon appears, the time the page containing the beacon was viewed, the type of browser used to view the page and the information in cookies set by the Ad Partners. Web beacons enable our Ad Partners to recognize a unique cookie on your web browser, which in turn enables us to learn which advertisements bring users to our Platform. 

With both cookies and web beacon technology, the information that we collect and share is anonymous and not personally identifiable. It does not contain your name, address, telephone number, or email address. Most web browsers are set to accept cookies. You can instruct your browser not to accept cookies. However, if you disable this function, you will not be able to use some of the features on our Site.

Email and Deactivation. Circle of Moms requires that members receive certain emails as part of their membership.  They can select which emails they will receive at <http://www.circleofmoms.com/mom_settings.php>.  Members who wish to deactivate their accounts can do so at <http://www.circleofmoms.com/deactivate.php>. 

Security.  We take precautions to ensure the security of your personal information. However, we cannot guarantee that hackers or unauthorized personnel may gain access to your personal information despite our efforts. You should note that in using the Service, your information will travel through third party infrastructures which are not under our control. 

We cannot protect, nor does this Privacy Policy apply to, any information that you transmit to other Users. You should never transmit personal or identifying information to other users. 

Children.  The Service is not intended for children under 13, and we do not knowingly collect information from children under the age of 13. 

Children aged 13 or older should not submit any personal information without the permission of their parents or guardians. By using the Service, you are representing that you are at least 18, or that you are at least 13 years old and have your parents' or guardians’ permission to use the Service. 

Changes.  We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to modify or change this Privacy Policy at any time with or without prior notice to you.  The date of the last update will be posted at the bottom of this Privacy Policy for your convenience. Your continued use of the Service following the posting of any changes to the Privacy Policy constitutes your full acceptance of those changes.

Question. This Privacy Policy describes the personal information we collect about you, why we collect it, how we use it and when we share it with third parties. Our Privacy Policy also describes the choices you can make about how we collect and use your information. If you have any questions about our Privacy Policy, you can always contact circleofmoms.com customer service in any of three ways:
