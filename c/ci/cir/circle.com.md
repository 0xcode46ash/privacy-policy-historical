### 1\. Circle’s Commitment to Privacy

At Circle, we know how important privacy is to our users. That is why we are committed to maintaining the confidentiality, integrity, and security of personal information about our users. We collect only what we need and will not share your personal information with any third parties other than our identity verification partner. Even within Circle, access to your personal information is limited to a subset of employees who work on compliance and identity verification matters.

### 2\. Purpose

This Privacy Policy is designed to let you know how Circle collects, uses, stores, shares and protects your personal information. It explains the data collection and use practices of the Circle’s website (www.circle.com) and its products and services (the “Services”) . The terms “you,” “your,” and “yours” refer to the customer utilizing our website. The terms “Circle,” “we,” “us,” and “our” refer to Circle. By using this website or any Services, you consent to the practices prescribed in this statement. We may amend this Privacy Policy at any time by posting a revised version on our website. If we make any big changes, we will notify you by email.

### 3\. How we collect information

When you visit the Circle website or use the Services, we collect information sent to us by your computer, mobile phone, or other access device. This information may include your IP address, device information including, but not limited to, identifier, name and type, operating system, mobile network information and standard web log information, such as your browser type, and the pages you accessed on our website. 

When you use a location-enabled device with our Services, we may collect geographical location data or use various means to determine the location, such as sensor data from your device that may, for instance, provide data on nearby cell towers and wi-fi access spots. 

### 4\. Registration Process; Identity Verification

If you create an account or use the Services, we may collect and store the following types of information: 

  * Contact information – your name, address, phone, email and other similar information.
  * Financial information – the account number and account balance information for any account that you link to your Circle Account. 



Before permitting you to use the Services, we may require you to provide additional information (such as a date of birth or partial social security number) so that we can verify your identity or address. We may also obtain information about you from third parties such as identity verification services. 

When you use the Services, we collect information about your transactions and your other activities on our website and we may collect information about your computer or other access device for fraud prevention purposes. 

We may collect additional information about you through your interactions with our support team.

### 5\. How we use cookies

When you access our website or content or use our application or the Services, we (or Google Analytics on our behalf) may place small data files called cookies on your computer or other device. We use these technologies to recognize you as a Circle user, customize the Services, content, and advertising; measure promotional effectiveness, and collect information about your computer or other access device to mitigate risk, help prevent fraud and promote trust and safety. 

We use both session and persistent cookies when you access our website or content. Session cookies expire and no longer have any effect when you log out of your account or close your browser. Longer lasting cookies, known as persistent cookies remain on your browser until you erase them or they expire. 

You are free to decline our cookies if your browser or browser add-on permits, but doing so may interfere with your use of our website. The help section of most browsers or browser add-ons provides instructions on blocking, deleting or disabling cookies. 

### 6\. How we protect and store personal information

Throughout this policy, we use the term “personal information” to describe information that can be associated with a specific person and can be used to identify that person. We do not consider personal information to include information that has been anonymized so that it does not identify a specific user. 

We take the privacy and security of your information very seriously. We store and process your personal information on our computers in the US where Circle facilities or our service providers are located. We protect your information using physical, technical, and administrative security measures to reduce the risks of loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure and alteration. Some of the safeguards we use are firewalls and data encryption, physical access controls to our data centers, and information access authorization controls. We also authorize access to personal information only for those employees who require it to fulfill their job responsibilities. All of our physical, electronic and procedural safeguards are designed to comply with applicable laws and regulations. 

### 7\. How we use the personal information we collect

We are sometimes required to compare the personal information you provide to third party databases in order to verify its accuracy and confirm your identity. This allows us to comply with state and federal anti-money laundering and “know your customer” regulations. 

We will also use your email address to send you notices about your transactions, deliver service update notices, marketing messages, and promotional offers based on your communication preferences. 

### 8\. Marketing

We will never sell or rent your personal information to third parties. We may combine your information with information we collect from other companies and use it to improve and personalize the Services, as well as our content and advertising.

### 9\. How we share personal information with other parties

We may share your personal information with: 

  * Our banking partners (if you link a bank account, debit card or credit card to your account). Note that if you link a bank account to your Circle Account, your bank account information will also be shared with Plaid Technologies, Inc. (“Plaid”) for the purpose of linking your bank account and conducting transactions between your bank account and your Circle Account. All shared information shall be treated in accordance with the Plaid’s privacy policy, which can be found at https://plaid.com/privacy. 
  * Companies that we plan to merge with or be acquired by. (Should such a combination occur, we will require that the new combined entity follow this Privacy Policy with respect to your personal information. You will receive prior notice of any change in applicable policy.)
  * 3rd party identification services for fraud prevention purposes.
  * Law enforcement, government officials, or other third parties when: 
    * We are compelled to do so by a subpoena, court order or similar legal procedure; or
    * We believe in good faith that the disclosure of personal information is necessary to prevent physical harm or financial loss, to report suspected illegal activity or to investigate violations of our User Agreement.
  * Circle users or other third parties if you direct us to share such information, consent to the sharing of such information, or opt in to Circle features that require the sharing of such information by enabling such features in the settings of your Circle Account.



Circle will not provide your personal information to any other Circle users without your consent or direction.

### 10\. How to Change Your Personal Information
