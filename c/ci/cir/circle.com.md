  * Contact information – your name, address, phone, email and other similar information.
  * Financial information – the full bank account numbers and/or credit card numbers that you link to your Circle Account or give us when you use Circle Services.

### How we use cookies

We use both session and persistent cookies when you access our website or content. Session cookies expire and no longer have any effect when you log out of your Circle Account or close your browser. Longer lasting cookies, known as persistent cookies remain on your browser until you erase them or they expire.

You are free to decline our cookies if your browser or browser add-on permits, but doing so may interfere with your use of our website. The help section of most browsers or browser add-ons provides instructions on blocking, deleting or disabling cookies.

### How we protect and store personal information

Throughout this policy, we use the term “personal information” to describe information that can be associated with a specific person and can be used to identify that person. We do not consider personal information to include information that has been anonymized so that it does not identify a specific user.

We store and process your personal information on our computers in the US and elsewhere in the world where Circle facilities or our service providers are located. We protect your information using physical, technical, and administrative security measures to reduce the risks of loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure and alteration. Some of the safeguards we use are firewalls and data encryption, physical access controls to our data centers, and information access authorization controls. We also authorize access to personal information only for those employees who require it to fulfill their job responsibilities. All of our physical, electronic and procedural safeguards are designed to comply with applicable laws and regulations.

### How we use the personal information we collect

Our primary purpose in collecting personal information is to provide you with a secure, efficient, and customized experience and we strive to limit the amount of personal information we need to collect, use or disclose. We may use your personal information to:

  * Provide Circle Services and related customer support;
  * Process exchanges from local currency to bitcoin and bitcoin to local currency;
  * Comply with anti-money laundering and “know your customer” regulations; and
  * Compare information for accuracy and verify it with third parties.



We will also use your email address to send you notices about your transactions, deliver service update notices, marketing messages, and promotional offers based on your communication preferences.

### Marketing

We will not sell or rent your personal information to third parties for their marketing purposes without your explicit consent. We may combine your information with information we collect from other companies and use it to improve and personalize the Circle Services, as well as our content and advertising.

### How we share personal information with other parties

We may share your personal information with:

  * Service providers under contract who assist with our business operations such as fraud prevention, bill collection, marketing and technology services. Our contracts dictate that these service providers only use your information in connection with the services they perform for us and not for their own benefit.
  * Partnering financial institutions.
  * Companies that we plan to merge with or be acquired by. (Should such a combination occur, we will require that the new combined entity follow this Privacy Policy with respect to your personal information. You will receive prior notice of any change in applicable policy.)
  * Law enforcement, government officials, or other third parties when: 
    * We are compelled to do so by a subpoena, court order or similar legal procedure; or
    * We believe in good faith that the disclosure of personal information is necessary to prevent physical harm or financial loss, to report suspected illegal activity or to investigate violations of our User Agreement.
  * Other third parties with your consent or direction to do so.



Circle will not provide your personal information to any other Circle users without your consent or direction.
