### **How we collect information about you**

When you visit the Circle website or use Circle services, we collect information sent to us by your computer, mobile phone, or other access device. This information may include your IP address, device information including, but not limited to, identifier, name and type, operating system, location, mobile network information and standard web log information, such as your browser type, traffic to and from our site and the pages you accessed on our website.

If you create an account or use Circle services, we may collect the following types of information:

  * Contact information – your name, address, phone, email, Skype ID and other similar information.
  * Financial information – the full bank account numbers and/or credit card numbers that you link to your Circle account or give us when you use Circle services.



Before permitting you to use Circle services, we may require you to provide additional information we can use to verify your identity or address or manage risk, such as your date of birth, social security number or other information. We may also obtain information about you from third parties such as credit bureaus and identity verification services.

When you use Circle services, we collect information about your transactions and your other activities on our website and we may collect information about your computer or other access device for fraud prevention purposes.

You may choose to provide us with access to certain personal information stored by third parties such as social media sites (such as Facebook and Twitter). The information we have access to varies by site and is controlled by your privacy settings on that site and your authorization. By associating an account managed by a third party with your Circle account and authorizing Circle to have access to this information, you agree that Circle may collect, store and use this information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

In order to help protect you from fraud and misuse of your personal information, we may collect information about your use and interaction with our website or Circle services. For example, we may evaluate your computer, mobile phone or other access device to identify any malicious software or activity that may affect the availability of Circle services.

Finally, we may collect additional information from or about you in other ways such as contacts with our customer support team.

### **How we use cookies**

When you access our website or content or use our application or Circle services, we, or companies we work with, may place small data files called cookies or pixel tags on your computer or other device. We use these technologies to recognize you as a Circle customer; customize Circle services, content, and advertising; measure promotional effectiveness; and collect information about your computer or other access device to mitigate risk, help prevent fraud and promote trust and safety.

We use both session and persistent cookies when you access our website or content. Session cookies expire and no longer have any effect when you log out of your account or close your browser. Longer lasting cookies, known as persistent cookies remain on your browser until you erase them or they expire.

We also use Local Shared Objects, commonly referred to as “Flash cookies,” to help ensure that your account security is not compromised, to spot irregularities in behavior to help prevent fraud and to support our sites and services.

We encode our cookies so that only we can interpret the information stored in them. You are free to decline our cookies if your browser or browser add-on permits, but doing so may interfere with your use of our website. The help section of most browsers or browser add-ons provides instructions on blocking, deleting or disabling cookies.

You may encounter Circle cookies or pixel tags on websites that we do not control. For example, if you view a web page created by a third party or use an application developed by a third party, there may be a cookie or pixel tag placed by the web page or application. Likewise, these third parties may place cookies or pixel tags that are not subject to our control and the Circle Privacy Policy does not cover their use.

### **How we protect and store personal information**

Throughout this policy, we use the term “personal information” to describe information that can be associated with a specific person and can be used to identify that person. We do not consider personal information to include information that has been anonymized so that it does not identify a specific user.

We store and process your personal information on our computers in the US and elsewhere in the world where Circle facilities or our service providers are located. We protect your information using physical, technical, and administrative security measures to reduce the risks of loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure and alteration. Some of the safeguards we use are firewalls and data encryption, physical access controls to our data centers, and information access authorization controls. We also authorize access to personal information only for those employees who require it to fulfill their job responsibilities. All of our physical, electronic and procedural safeguards in designed to comply with applicable laws and regulations.

### **How we use the personal information we collect**

Our primary purpose in collecting personal information is to provide you with a secure, efficient, and customized experience. We may use your personal information to:

  * Provide Circle services and customer support you request;
  * Process transactions and send notices about your transactions;
  * Resolve disputes, collect fees, and troubleshoot problems;
  * Prevent potentially prohibited or illegal activities;
  * Customize, measure, and improve Circle services and the content and layout of our website and applications;
  * Deliver targeted marketing, service update notices, and promotional offers based on your communication preferences; and
  * Compare information for accuracy and verify it with third parties.



### **Marketing**

We will not sell or rent your personal information to third parties for their marketing purposes without your explicit consent. We may combine your information with information we collect from other companies and use it to improve and personalize Circle services, content and advertising.

### **How we share personal information with other Circle users**

To process your payments, we may share some of your personal information with the person or company that you are paying or that is paying you. Your contact information, date of sign-up, the number of payments you have received from verified Circle users, and whether you have verified control of a bank account are provided to other Circle users who you transact with through Circle. In addition, this and other information may also be shared with third parties when you use these third parties to access Circle services. Unless you have agreed to it, these third parties are not allowed to use this information for any purpose other than to facilitate your transactions using Circle services.

If you are buying goods or services and pay using Circle, we may also provide the seller with your shipping and confirmed billing address to help complete your transaction with the seller. The seller is not allowed to use this information to market their services to you unless you have agreed to it. If an attempt to pay your seller fails, or is later invalidated, we may also provide your seller with details of the unsuccessful payment. To facilitate dispute resolutions, we may provide a buyer with the seller’s address so that goods can be returned to the seller.

We work with third parties, including merchants, to enable them to accept or facilitate payments from or to you using Circle. In doing so, a third party may share information about you with us, such as your email address or mobile phone number to inform you that a payment is sent to you or when you attempt to pay that merchant or through that third party. We use this information to confirm that you are a Circle customer and that bitcoin as a form of payment can be enabled, or where a payment is sent to you, to send you notification that you have received a payment. Also, if you request that we validate your status as a Circle customer with a third party, we will do so. Please note that merchants you buy from and contract with have their own privacy policies, and Circle cannot be held responsible for their operations, including, but not limited to, their information practices.

### **How we share personal information with other parties**

We may share your personal information with:

  * Service providers under contract who assist with our business operations such as fraud prevention, bill collection, marketing and technology services. Our contracts dictate that these service providers only use your information in connection with the services they perform for us and not for their own benefit.
  * Partnering financial institutions.
  * Companies that we plan to merge with or be acquired by. (Should such a combination occur, we will require that the new combined entity follow this Privacy Policy with respect to your personal information. You will receive prior notice of any change in applicable policy.)
  * Law enforcement, government officials, or other third parties when: 
    * We are compelled to do so by a subpoena, court order or similar legal procedure; or
    * We believe in good faith that the disclosure of personal information is necessary to prevent physical harm or financial loss, to report suspected illegal activity or to investigate violations of our User Agreement.
  * Other third parties with your consent or direction to do so.



Circle will not sell or rent any of your personal information to third parties for their marketing purposes and only shares your personal information with third parties as described in this policy.

If you establish a Circle account indirectly on a third party website or via a third party application, any information that you enter on that website or application (and not directly on a Circle website) will be shared with the owner of the third party website or application and your information may be subject to their privacy policies.
