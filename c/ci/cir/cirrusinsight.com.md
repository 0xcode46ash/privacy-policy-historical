# Salesforce for Gmail - Cirrus Insight - Create Leads, Contacts, Events, Tasks in Salesforce from Gmail

As you use and access Cirrus Insight, Cirruspath, LLC will learn certain information about you. How we will handle information we learn about you depends upon how you use the product.

## Information Collection

If you use the Cirrus Insight to display and create information in Salesforce CRM, we collect:

  1. Your salesforce.com organization name, salesforce.com edition, and internal salesforce.com organization ID.
  2. Your salesforce.com username and other personal information that salesforce.com collects such as name, phone number, and email.
  3. Which browser(s) you use to connect to our service.
  4. The date and time you accessed the service.
  5. Your product settings.



If you choose to upgrade to a paid Cirrus Insight plan, we will also collect additional information including your name, address, and credit card information. This information will be used only to collect payment for the service. Complete credit card information (full CC number, CVV2) is never stored on Cirruspath servers and is passed securely to payment processors.

Aggregate information is also collected for statistical purposes. Cirruspath, LLC may use software programs to create summary statistics, which are used for such purposes as assessing the number of uses of different features of the product, what information is of most and least interest, determining technical design specifications, and identifying system performance or problem areas.

**No CRM data is ever stored, with the exception of data that is encrypted and cached briefly for application performance purposes.**

## Passwords and User Credentials

In order to search for data in your salesforce.com account, you must authorize the Cirrus Insight application. Without your explicit authorization, Cirrus Insight will not and can not access your salesforce.com data. Your authorization involves signing into Salesforce with your salesforce.com username and password. This authentication process is _entirely_ managed by Salesforce and _not_ Cirrus Insight. The result of your authorization is that Cirrus Insight will be given a private "password" to your Salesforce account, which we encrypt before saving. _Cirrus Insight never sees your salesforce.com password._

Cirrus Insight does not authenticate with Gmail and we do not have any visibility to your Google Apps account information.

Cirruspath, LLC cares about the privacy of your personal information. No personally-identifiable information will be sold or otherwise transferred to unaffiliated third parties without the approval of the user.
