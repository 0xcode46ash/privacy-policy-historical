## Information Gathering and Usage

  * Without your explicit authorization, Cirrus Insight cannot access your Salesforce data. You authorize Cirrus Insight by signing into Salesforce with your Salesforce username and password. This authentication process is entirely managed by Salesforce. The result of your authorization is that Salesforce will give Cirrus Insight a private password to your Salesforce account, which we encrypt before saving. Cirrus Insight never sees your Salesforce password. For more information on this, please see: [Security](https://web.archive.org/features/security/ "Security").
  * When you authorize Cirrus Insight by signing in to Salesforce, we collect your Salesforce username, organization name, organization ID, edition, and other personal information that Salesforce collects such as name, phone number, and email. We also collect information about which browser(s) you use to connect to our service, the date and time you access our service, and your product settings.
  * If you upgrade to a paid Cirrus Insight plan, we collect credit card information. Billing information is used to collect payment for the service. Complete credit card information is never seen or stored by Cirruspath, Inc.; it is passed securely to payment processors.
  * We do not store CRM data, with the exception of data that is encrypted and cached briefly for application performance purposes.
  * Cirruspath, Inc. uses collected information for the following general purposes: products and services provision, billing, identification and authentication, services improvement, contact, and research.
