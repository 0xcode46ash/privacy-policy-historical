# Privacy Policy - CircleCI

**This Privacy Policy is effective as of April 4, 2016.**

Circle Internet Services, Inc. dba CircleCI, a Delaware corporation (“CircleCI”, “we” or “us”) provides this Privacy Policy to inform users of our policies and procedures regarding the collection, use and disclosure of personally identifying information (or “PII”) received from users of our website at http://circleci.com (the “Website”) and our software-as-a-service platform (the “Service”). This Privacy Policy applies to the Website and the Service, and includes information collected via the Website, email, SMS, telephone or other means.

By using or accessing the Website or the Service, you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Policy, and you are consenting to our processing of your information as set forth in this Privacy Policy now and as amended by us. If you have any questions or comments about this Privacy Policy or our use of your personally identifying information, please contact us at [support@circleci.com](mailto:support@circleci.com).

Except as otherwise expressly set forth in this Privacy Policy or otherwise mutually agreed with the applicable customer, our use of PII collected through the Service shall be limited to the purpose of providing the Service for which the applicable customer has engaged CircleCI.

## Service Users and Website Visitors

Like most hosted service operators, CircleCI collects non-personally identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site and the date and time of each visitor request and store it in log files. CircleCI may also collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to the Website and the Service. CircleCI’s purpose in collecting such information is to better understand how CircleCI’s visitors use the Website and the Service and to improve the Website and the Service.

CircleCI also collects potentially personally identifying information like Internet Protocol (“IP”) addresses. CircleCI does not use such information to identify its visitors, other than for providing the Service and for support purposes, and does not disclose such information other than under the circumstances described below.

## Gathering of Personally Identifying Information

Certain visitors to the Website and the Service choose to interact with CircleCI in ways that require CircleCI to gather PII. The amount and type of information that CircleCI gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, when signing up for the Service, we may ask a user to provide the user’s name and the name of the user’s company, as well as an email address and telephone number where we may contact the user and/or another representative of the user’s company. Each user may have to provide a username and password that, along with other information, we use to create and administer accounts. Alternatively, CircleCI may also collect such information when a user authenticates through a third party, such as GitHub and grants access for CircleCI to obtain such information from such third party, rather than having the user provide it directly to CircleCI. In each case, CircleCI collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the user’s interaction with CircleCI. Therefore, a user’s PII may be obtained by CircleCI by a user logging into the Website or the Service using sign-in services such as OAuth (e.g., login with a GitHub account), as more fully discussed below.

CircleCI does not disclose PII other than as described in this Privacy Policy. In addition, visitors can always refuse to supply personally identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from accessing the Service or engaging in certain activities on the Website or Service.

## Access to Personally Identifying Information

If your PII changes, or if you no longer desire to access or use the Service, you may correct, update, amend or delete it by contacting our customer support team at [support@circleci.com](mailto:support@circleci.com). We will respond to your request within a reasonable timeframe.

That said, where CircleCI’s customer for the Service is an organization and a user is accessing and using the Service as an authorized representative of that organization, references to “you” and the like in this Privacy Policy generally refer to the customer organization, not individual end users. In such cases, CircleCI receives and processes information under the direction of its customer and has no direct contractual relationship with the individuals whose PII is or may be provided. Any such individual who seeks access, or who seeks to correct, amend, or delete inaccurate data, should direct his or her query to the applicable CircleCI customer and we will respond to the customer’s request within a reasonable timeframe.

## Data Retention

For Service users, we will retain PII for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law.

## Metric and Usage Data

CircleCI collects, aggregates, and stores metrics and usage data for its customers in order to provide the Service and support associated with the Service. CircleCI in turn will not disclose individual metric or usage data other than in an aggregated form or for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.

## Bulletin Boards/Chat Rooms

If you use a bulletin board or chat room on the Website or the Service, you should be aware that any personally identifiable information you submit there can be read, collected, or used by other users of these forums, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages. We are not responsible for the personally identifiable information you choose to submit in these forums.

## Protection of Certain Personally Identifying Information

CircleCI discloses potentially personally identifying and personally identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors, and affiliated organizations that (1) need to know that information in order to process it on CircleCI’s behalf or to provide services available in connection with the Service and (2) have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using CircleCI’s Website and/or the Service, you consent to the transfer of information to such individuals and organizations in order to support our provision to you of the Website and the Service. These supporting partners may be authorized to, for example, process payments on our behalf or provide customer support. Transfers to subsequent third parties are covered by the provisions in this Policy regarding notice and choice and the service agreements with our customers. However, in each case, these partners are authorized to use your PII only as necessary to provide the services we request.

Other than to its employees, contractors, and affiliated organizations, as described above, CircleCI discloses potentially personally identifying and personally identifying information only when required to do so by law, such as to comply with a subpoena, bankruptcy proceedings, or similar legal process, or when CircleCI believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of CircleCI, third parties, or the public at large. If CircleCI is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, either you will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice through the Service of any change in ownership or uses of your personally identifying information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your PII or we will require any such buyer to agree to treat your PII in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

If you are a registered user of the Service and have supplied your email address, CircleCI may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with CircleCI and our products. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. CircleCI takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration, or destruction of potentially personally identifying and personally identifying information.

## Cookies

We and our partners (e.g. marketing partners), affiliates, or analytics or service providers (e.g. payment processor) use technologies such as cookies, beacons, tags, and scripts to analyze trends, administer the website, track users' movements around the website, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these companies on an individual and aggregated basis.

A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. CircleCI uses cookies to help identify and track visitors, their usage of CircleCI services, and their preferences. CircleCI visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using CircleCI’s services, with the drawback that certain or all of the features of CircleCI’s services may not function properly without the aid of cookies.

Certain of our third-party providers employ clear gifs (also known as “beacons” and “bugs”), images and scripts that help them better manage content. We do not tie the information gathered to our Customers’ or users’ personally identifying information.

We use browser-based local storage to store content information and preferences. Third parties with whom we partner to provide certain features on our website or to display advertising based upon your web browsing activity also use Flash cookies and browser-based local storage to collect and store information. Various browsers may offer their own management tools for removing browser-based local storage.

## Behavioral Targeting/Re-Targeting

We partner with one or more third-party ad networks to either display advertising on our Web site or to manage our advertising on other sites. Our ad network partners use cookies and Web beacons to collect non-personally identifying information about your activities on this and other Web sites to provide you targeted advertising based upon your interests. If you wish to not have this information used for the purpose of serving you targeted ads, you may opt-out by clicking [here](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/) or if located in the European Union, click [here](http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/). Please note this does not opt you out of being served advertising. You will continue to receive generic ads.

## Links to Other Websites

This Privacy Policy applies only to the Website and the Service and not to any third-party sites or hosted services you may find or access through our Website. If you submit personally identifying information to any of those sites or services, your information is governed by their privacy policies. We encourage you to carefully read the privacy policy of any site you visit or hosted service you use.

## Testimonials

We display personal testimonials of satisfied customers on our site in addition to other endorsements. With your consent we may post your testimonial along with your name. If you wish to update or delete your testimonial, you can contact us at [support@circleci.com](mailto:support@circleci.com).

## Social Media Widgets

The Website and the Service may include social media features, such as the Twitter button, and widgets, such as the Share this button or interactive mini-programs. These features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on the Website, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. Social media features and widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on the Websites or the Service. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.

## Single Sign-On

You can log in to the Website and the Service using sign-in services such as OAuth (e.g., login with a GitHub account). These services will authenticate your identity and provide you the option to share certain personally identifying information with us such as your name and email address.

## Security

We take precautions to ensure the security of your personally identifying information. We follow generally accepted standards to protect the PII submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. When you enter your login information on the Service, we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).

That said, like any hosted service provider, we cannot guarantee that unauthorized third parties or unauthorized personnel will not gain access to your PII despite our efforts. You should note that in using the Website and the Service, your information will travel through third-party infrastructures which are not under our control.

We cannot protect, nor does this Privacy Policy apply to, any information that you transmit to other users of the Website or the Service. You should never transmit personal or identifying information to other users.

If you have any questions about security on the Website or the Service, you can contact us at [support@circleci.com](mailto:support@circleci.com).

## Opt-Out Policy

If, at any time after registering, you change your mind about receiving information from us or about the use of information volunteered by you, please send us a request specifying your new choice. Please contact us as specified above. You may also choose to stop receiving our newsletters or marketing emails by following the unsubscribe instructions included in these emails, or by accessing the email preferences in your account settings page.

## Privacy Policy Changes

Although most changes are likely to be minor, CircleCI may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in CircleCI’s sole discretion. If we make any material changes to this Privacy Policy, we will either notify you by email (sent to the email address specified in your account) or by means of a notice on the Website and/or within the Service prior to the change becoming effective. We encourage you to periodically review the Website for the latest information on our privacy practices. Your continued use of the Website and the Service after any change in this Privacy Policy takes effect will constitute your acceptance of such change.
