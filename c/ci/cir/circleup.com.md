# CircleUp - privacy policy

| Â  |  At CircleUp we recognize that your privacy is extremely important, and protecting your privacy and personal information is cornerstone of our business. 

This policy covers how CircleUp treats personal information that CircleUp collects and receives, including information related to your past use of CircleUp products and services. Personal information is information about you that is personally identifiable like your name, address, email address, or phone number, and that is not otherwise publicly available. 

Your Guarantee of Privacy

At CircleUp, we don't believe in SPAM. Period. 

_We won't rent, sell or barter or lease your email or instant messenger address or your contacts' emails addresses or IM accounts to third parties._ That is your information, and even though we store it, we will never give it away or share it. In addition, we will only send you CircleUp emails directly related to your account or the CircleUp service. CircleUp does not rent email lists (ever), nor will we share your name with "marketing partners" unless you specifically authorize it by proactively opting-in to a mailing list. 

Privacy of Questions

The CircleUp service enables questions to have different levels of privacy. These privacy choices are selected by the question Author and determine how and to whom your responses are displayed. Your contact information (email, IM, SMS) is NEVER displayed in full, but to attach some identity to your answer we use your address prefix. Questions can have the following privacy status:   


**Public:** Anyone will be able to view the results of the question, including search engines. The question and results are posted publicly for search and can be accessed by anyone with the link to the results page. 
**Private Summary:** Only recipients of the question (the circle) and those they forward the question to will be able to view the summary results (in aggregate), but not individual responses or comments. Only the Author can review individual answers and comments. 
**Private Detailed:** Only recipients of the question and those they forward to will be able to view the complete results. The entire circle can review individual answers and comments. 
**Personal:** Only the author can view the results of the question, both summary and detail. 
  
Your Contacts' Personal Information

The CircleUp service sends communications on your behalf to people you know. We understand that these people trust you with their contact information, and we maintain it with the same confidentiality as you do. 

Your contacts' email addresses and instant messenger (IM) accounts are held in the same strict confidence that your own contact information is held. We will never contact any of your contacts directly unless you make a specific request. We will never rent, lease, sell or barter this information to any third party. We will only use your contacts' email or IM address in order to send the message you asked us to send. Your contacts will never ever hear from us again ... unless they voluntarily subscribe to our services!
