* ### Types of Information We Collect

When you interact with us through the Site or the Services, we may collect Personal Data and other non-personal information from you, as further described below.

**Personal Data That You Provide Through the Site:**  Personal Data is information that identifies you and that can be used alone to contact you online or offline. We collect Personal Data from you when you provide such information to us such as when you register for access to the Services (for example, contact information such as your name, email address, and mailing address) when you wish to use certain Services (for example financial information such as bank account numbers, your date of birth and the last four digits of you social security number), when you contact us with inquiries or respond to our marketing surveys and email campaigns, when you link to your profile on a third-party site or platform with your Account, and otherwise when you use our services where Personal Data is required for use and/or participation. When anonymous information is directly associated with Personal Data, this anonymous information is also treated as Personal Data.

**By voluntarily providing us with Personal Data, you are consenting to our use of it in accordance with this Privacy Policy and you agree that you will abide by our Terms of Service. If you provide Personal Data, you acknowledge and agree that such Personal Data may be transferred from your current location to the offices and servers of CircleUp and the authorized third parties referred to herein located in the United States of America.**

**Non-Personal, Anonymous, or Aggregated Data:** Non-personal information, alone, cannot be used to identify or contact you. When you interact with CircleUp through the Site or Services, we receive and store certain non-personal information about you for purposes that include improving our products and services, troubleshooting bugs, providing services to you, facilitating the provision of updates, dynamically served content and product support, and communicating with you. Such information, which may be collected passively using various technologies or through other means, may include demographic information including gender, age, zip code, information about your computer, hardware, software, media, mobile device, including unique device IDs or other device identifiers, incident data, Internet Protocol (IP) address, network Media Access Control (MAC) address and connection. We may also receive information from third parties in connection with marketing and demographic studies and/or other data that we use to supplement personal information provided directly by you.

* ### How We Collect Information

We collect information you provide to us when you request products, services or information from us, register with us, participate in forums or other activities in our sites and applications, respond to surveys or otherwise interact with us. 

In order to access additional functionality of the Site, you may be required to create an account for your use of the Service (an “Account”). You may create an Account directly via the Site or by logging into your Account with certain third party social networking sites (including Facebook and LinkedIn) via our Service. If you decide to create an Account by logging into a social networking site via our Service, we will obtain the Personal Data you have provided to the social networking site (such as your name, profile picture, email address, and other information you make publicly available via the applicable social networking site) from the account you have with such social networking site and use that information to create your Account. The information we obtain may depend on the privacy settings you have with the social networking site. We also collect other information that you provide as part of account registration and your use of the Service.

  * **Internet Log Files**



As is true of most web sites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. CircleUp may store such information itself or such information may be included in databases owned and maintained by CircleUp affiliates, agents, or service providers. This Site may use such information and pool it with other information to track, for example, the total number of visitors to our Site, the number of visitors to each page of our Site, the domain names of our visitors' Internet service providers, and how our users use and interact with the Services. Also, in an ongoing effort to better understand and serve the users of the Services, CircleUp often conducts research on its customer demographics, interests, and behavior based on Personal Data and other information provided to CircleUp by Issuers and Users.

This research may be compiled and analyzed on an aggregate basis. CircleUp may share this non-personal and aggregate data with its affiliates, agents and business partners, but this type of non-personal and aggregate information does not identify you personally. CircleUp may also disclose aggregated user statistics in order to describe our Services to current and prospective business partners and to other third parties for other lawful purposes.

  * **Cookies**



In operating this Site, we may also use a technology called "cookies." A cookie is a piece of information that the computer that hosts our Site gives to your browser when you access the Site. Our cookies help provide additional functionality to the Site and help us analyze Site usage more accurately. For instance, our Site may set a cookie on your browser that allows you to access the Site without needing to remember and then enter a password more than once during a visit to the Site. In all cases in which we use cookies, we will not collect Personal Data except with your permission. On most web browsers, you will find a "help" section on the toolbar.

  * **Clear GIFs and Tracking Pixels**



Clear GIFs (including web bugs, beacons or tags) are small graphic images placed on a web page, web-based document, or in an email message. Clear GIFs are invisible to the user because they are small (only 1-by-1 pixel) and usually the same color as the background of the web page, document or email message. We do not use clear GIFs to collect Personal Data about you. We may, however, use clear GIFs to capture statistical usage information for our web pages, features or other elements on a web page. We correlate this information to a user to personalize user experience and for statistical analysis of user experiences on our web pages.

We and third parties may also use tracking pixels, which allow us to advertise more efficiently by, for example, excluding our current users from certain promotional messages or identifying the source of a new installation.

  * **Analytic Metric Tools and Other Technology**



CircleUp uses third party analytics technologies to collect information when you use our online services. These tools and technologies use server log files, web beacons, cookies, tracking pixels and other technologies to collect and analyze certain types of information, including cookies, IP addresses (including for purposes of determining your approximate geographic location), mobile or other hardware device ID or other device identifiers, browser types, browser language, information passed from your browser (if any), referring and exit pages, and URLs, platform type, click information, information about your media, peripheral hardware, software and/or applications installed on your machine and/or device, domain names and types, landing pages, pages viewed and the order of those pages, advertising conversion rates, the date and amount of time spent on particular pages, other internet and website usage information, and the date and time of activity on our websites, as well as unique hardware identifies such as MAC Address, mobile unique device ID (if applicable) and other similar information.

  * **This Site Uses Google Analytics and AdWords**



This Site uses Google Analytics to track viewing trends and help analyze how visitors use the CircleUp Site. This information helps us to improve the CircleUp Site and the overall user experience. Google Analytics uses cookies to collect standard internet log information and visitor behavior information in an anonymous form. None of the information gathered is personally identifiable in nature without your expressed permission.
