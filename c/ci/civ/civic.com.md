All e-mail mailing lists maintained by civic.com and its parent company, FCW Government Technology Group, contain the names of people who requested to receive information from us.

Currently, e-mail addresses may be used by FCW Government Technology Group to promote FCW and IDG products and services, surveys, and for editorial consultations with users. When a user has given us explicit permission, his/her e-mail address may be rented to outside firms for promotional purposes. We allow users to "opt out" of receiving e-mail from outside firms and/or from FCW Government Technology Group and its sister companies when e-mail information is collected. Users who later decide they want to change their preferences may do so by sending e-mail to [subscriptions@fcw.com](mailto:subscriptions@fcw.com).

While FCW Government Technology Group will seek to require third parties with whom it has agreements to follow appropriate privacy policies, we do not bear any responsibility for any actions or policies of such third parties. 

civic.com collects no personally identifying information about individuals except when specifically and knowingly provided by such individuals. In addition, civic.com may place a "cookie" in the browser files of a user's computer.

The aggregated information we collect is used for the following purposes: 

    * to improve the content and design of the civic.com Web site 
    * to help advertisers and potential advertisers asses the suitability of the site for their ad campaigns
