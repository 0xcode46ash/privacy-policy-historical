## Information Collection

Like all other Web sites, FCW.COM receives IP addresses from all users because this information is automatically reported by a users browser each time a Web page is viewed. Aggregated IP address information is used for various purposes:

* To help diagnose problems with our server  
* To improve the content and design of FCW.COM  
* To gather broad demographic information.  


FCW.COM collects no personally identifying information about individuals except when specifically and knowingly provided by such individuals (for example, those who sign up for the MY FCW.COM customized features of the site or for our electronic newsletters). 

Our site's registration page only requires users to provide their name and email address to sign up. The user's contact information is also used to contact the visitor only when necessary. Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings when they sign up.

## Cookies

FCW.COM may place a cookie in the browser files of a user's computer. The cookie itself does not contain any personally identifying information but enables FCW.COM to manage advertisements presented to users and to customize FCW.COM based on user preferences. All parts of FCW.COM where users are prompted to login or that are customizable require that they accept cookies. Those who do not wish to accept cookies should follow the procedures for disallowing them specified by their particular browser.

The data FCW.COM retains about our users is stored on a secure server. No one outside FCW.COM has access to the data. You can, at any time, access your profile and login information and change it or delete it. Even when you share your cells or pages with people, they cannot see, nor do they have access to your account. They can only view information in those cells you have chosen to share with them.

## DoubleClick

FCW.COM uses DoubleClick to serve online ads. DoubleClick does not use any information gathered from FCW.COM ads to open up a file on a particular user's browsing habits. FCW.COM is not a part of DoubleClick's Abacus Alliance; therefore, pages viewed on FCW.COM do not get entered into the Abacus database. Although DoubleClick does provide FCW with information about ad clickthroughs, it is strictly in the aggregate. FCW tracks how many viewers clicked on particular ads, how many times that ad was viewed, but not the actions of any individual.
