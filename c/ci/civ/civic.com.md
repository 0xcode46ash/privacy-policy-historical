# Privacy Policies

Like all other Web sites, FCW.com receives IP (Internet Protocol) addresses from all site visitors because this information is automatically reported by a user's browser each time a Web page is viewed. Aggregated IP address information is used for purposes such as:

* To help diagnose problems with our server.  
* To improve the content and design of FCW.com.  
* To gather broad demographic information.  





FCW.com collects no personally identifying information about individuals except when specifically and knowingly provided by such individuals (for example, those who sign up for electronic newsletters).

## Cookies

FCW.com may place a cookie in the browser files of a Web site visitor's computer. The cookie itself does not contain any personally identifying information but enables FCW.com to manage advertisements presented to users. Those who do not wish to accept cookies should follow the procedures for disallowing them specified by their particular browser.

The data FCW.com retains about its visitors is stored on a secure server. No one outside FCW.com has access to the data.

## DoubleClick

FCW.com uses a company called DoubleClick to serve online ads. DoubleClick does not use any information gathered from FCW.com ads to open a file on a particular user's browsing habits. FCW.com is not a part of DoubleClick's Abacus Alliance. Therefore, pages viewed on FCW.com are not entered into the Abacus database. Although DoubleClick does provide FCW with information about ad clickthroughs, it is strictly in the aggregate â€” collective information, not about individual users. FCW tracks how many viewers clicked on particular ads, how many times that ad was viewed, but we do not track the actions of any individual.

## E-mail

All e-mail lists maintained by FCW contain the names of people who have requested to receive products or services from FCW Media Group. Those products and services include Federal Computer Week, Government E-Business (formerly civic.com), FCW.com electronic newsletters and the Government CIO Summit series.

Currently, e-mail addresses may be used by FCW to promote FCW.com, Federal Computer Week, Government E-Business and FCW conferences, events and services. E-mail addresses may also be used for surveys for requalification and for editorial consultations with users.

Users may choose to opt out of receiving e-mail from FCW or outside firms when they first provide their e-mail information to FCW. In addition, every e-mail message from FCW or from an outside firm contains information on unsubscribing. Users who decide at any time to change their preferences may do so by sending an e-mail to [doug_mashkuri@fcw.com](mailto:doug_mashkuri@fcw.com).

The e-mail address collected by FCW may be rented to outside firms for promotional purposes only with the permission of the user. Offers for which the names are rented are screened, and renters are required to target their offers carefully. FCW seeks to require third parties with whom it has agreements to follow appropriate privacy policies, but it does not bear any responsibility for any actions or policies of such third parties.

## Subscribers' Data

Subscribers to the print edition of Federal Computer Week receive their subscriptions based on their answers to identifying demographic information.

The information collected from subscribers is used in the following ways:

  1. It is used by FCW to improve the content of our products.
  2. It is used to notify subscribers about requalification and renewal.
  3. It is used for marketing FCW products and services.
  4. It is used by our audit bureau to verify cumulative demographic statistics.
  5. It is used by FCW for research surveys.
  6. It is used by FCW's editorial department for consultation with readers.



Readers' postal addresses will be used to promote FCW products and services, and may be rented to selected outside firms for promotional purposes. Offers for which the names are rented are screened, and renters are required to target their offers carefully.
