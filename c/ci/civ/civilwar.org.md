## Information security

We take our users' privacy very seriously. When users submit personal data to the Civil War Preservation Trust, we take steps to ensure the information remains secure both during transmission and while stored offline. Some of these measures include an enterprise grade firewall and secured environment for the data storage. All sensitive donor information is stored in this manner and only accessed by authorized CWPT staff through a monitored and recorded login process using secure communication and password protection. 

For our users' protection, this website uses Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), the standard of World Wide Web security, whenever financial transactions are being conducted.

## Server log data 

Our system gathers server log data which may include an IP address, the type of browser and operating system used, the time of day visited, the pages viewed, and search requests. We collect this data and use it for statistical purposes, helping us to ascertain, for example, the amount of interest in portions of our web site, and how to improve the navigation and content of our web site.

## Links to Third Party Sites

While the CWPT is highly selective about which sites we provide links to, we do not control their websites. We encourage you to review the privacy policies posted on these third party sites.

Due to the rapidly evolving technologies on the Internet, we may update this policy. All revisions will be posted to this site. A revised Privacy Policy will apply only to data collected subsequent to its effective date.
