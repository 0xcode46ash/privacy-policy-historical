  * Your email address: We will NEVER send you e-mails if you request us not to. As a default, we assume your consent to send you e-mails for purposes of: 
    1. E-mailing you copy of the order
    2. E-mailing you the shipping confirmation
    3. E-mailing you a short customer satisfaction survey
    4. E-mailing you ‘Reminders’ for products you opt to be reminded for

Gathering Information

  * Every website inevitably collects information. However, we have a comprehensive information gathering policy to maintain your privacy.


  * For Visitors (people who look into our store or visit us) - When you visit cilory.com, we know that someone is visiting us but we do NOT know that it is you. We ONLY count the number of visitors and track which pages/products are of greater interest to visitors. We do NOT gather or use any information about any specific persons who visit our site

    1. We keep a record of your personal information but it is covered by our Privacy Policy and is held in strictest confidence.
    2. You have the right to know what information we have collected about you. You also have the right to change this information. If you would like to contact us about changing some aspect of the information we have for you, please write to us at customerservice@cilory.com
    3. In order to make changes to your information you will be required to first prove your identity to us. This prevents other individuals from accessing your files.

    6. In summary, your purchase from cilory.com is held in the strictest of confidence. And it is 100% private!!



Legal issues

  * Just in case, a transaction is involved in a legal dispute (usually credit card fraud), information might be requested from us in form of a sub-poena (legal demand for information or appearance). In such cases, we might be required to furnish requisite information. In case this occurs, our policy is to first contact the customer (through preferred medium chosen by the customer) to inform them of our legal obligations.


  * These issues are not common and generally happen in case of credit card frauds. Hence, such information sharing would help in protecting your account and business with us.

  * Our site may link to other websites that may collect personally identifiable information about you. Any such pages will clearly be identifiable in the browser URL and will not carry the cilory.com logo on the top.
