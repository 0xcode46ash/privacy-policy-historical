### Cisdem PDFToolkit is my favorite with its nice, clean user interface covering most functions, including merge PDF files, split PDF files, compress PDF files, extract images and text from PDF files. If you're looking for an application that can get most of their PDF-related tasks done without many extras, then check out Cisdem PDFToolkit.
