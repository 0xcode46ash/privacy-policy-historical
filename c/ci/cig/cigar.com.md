## California "Do Not Track" Compliance

Top of Page

"Do Not Track" (or DNT) is a preference you can set in your browser to let the websites you visit know that you do not want them collecting certain information about you. Cigar.com does not support "do not track" requests. 

## Security

Cigar.com is committed to protecting your private information. To help safeguard against unauthorized access to your personal information and to ensure that your information is used appropriately, we have put in place systems and procedures to secure the information we collect online. 

We protect the security of your information during transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts the information you input. This industry standard encrypts all of your information, including credit card numbers, so that it cannot be read by others as the information is exchanged via the internet. 

Additionally, it is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer. If you use a shared computer, be sure to sign off and close all browsers when you are finished. 

We are committed to only selling our products to adults who meet the legal age requirement to purchase tobacco products. As a part of meeting that commitment, we use a non-affiliated third party company, Veratad Technologies, LLC, to verify that you are who you say you are and to assure that you are of legal age to purchase our products. 

### How does Veratad’s Age Verification work?

[](http://www.veratad.com/) Veratad’s AgeMatch Age Verification services use multiple trusted data sources containing billions of public records to return an age validation based on the personal information you submit. This service is specifically designed to validate and protect your identity while maintaining the highest level of consumer privacy when processing online transactions. 

Access to the public records allows Veratad to validate the information you provide and in some cases, depending on the nature of your purchase, to present a series of multiple choice questions based on non-credit related (“out-of-wallet”) historical facts about you. These facts are obtained by instantaneously scanning billions of public records from trusted data sources containing information that would not generally be found in your wallet if lost or stolen. 

### Is the information I provide secure?

Absolutely. Veratad’s secure 256 bit encryption technology ensures the safe delivery of the information you provide online. In addition, Veratad DOES NOT store your sensitive personal information or share (or sell) any data with other third parties. This practice assures you that unauthorized parties cannot gain access to your sensitive personal information. 

### What happens if I cannot be verified by the Age Verification process?

A small percentage of shoppers may not be verifiable due to limited availability of publicly available information contained within the Age Verification databases. If this happens, we will attempt to contact you via phone and email to verify your age. To do this, we typically require a copy of your driver’s license or some other form of government issued ID that verifies your date of birth. 

### I live outside of the U.S. Can I be verified?

Cigar.com’s use of Veratad’s Age Verification is based solely on U.S. record information and therefore verification of individuals residing outside the U.S. is un-available. **Military Addresses outside of the US are acceptable.** All other countries will be subject to our manual review process.
