**Compassion International Online Privacy Statement**

Compassion International is committed to respecting your online privacy and security. We've structured our Web site so that, in general, you can visit us on the Web without identifying yourself or revealing any personal information. Once you choose to provide us personally identifiable information (any information by which you can be identified), you can be assured that it will only be used to support your sponsor relationship with Compassion International.

****

**Awareness**

Compassion International provides this Online Privacy Statement to make you aware of our privacy policy and security practices, and to inform you about the way your information is collected and used. To make this notice easy to find, we make it available on our homepage and from the bottom of every Compassion International Web page.

**What we collect**

On some Compassion International Web pages you can become a sponsor, make donations, and request materials. The types of personal information collected on these pages are name, contact and billing information, transaction, and credit card information. In order to tailor our subsequent communications to you and continuously improve our services, we may also ask you to provide us with information regarding your personal or professional interests, demographics, experiences as a sponsor, and contact preferences. 

****

**How we use it**

Compassion International uses your information to understand your needs and provide you with better service. Specifically, we use your information to help you complete a transaction, communicate back to you, update you on your sponsored child and special events, and to personalize our Web site for you. Credit card numbers are used only for payment processing and are not retained for other purposes. From time to time, we may also use your information to contact you for market research or provide you with information we think would be of particular interest. At a minimum, we will always give you the opportunity to decline such direct marketing or market research contact. We will also follow local requirements, such as allowing you to opt in before receiving unsolicited contact, where applicable. Data collected online may also be combined with information you provide when you register online as a Compassion sponsor.

**Who we share it with**

Compassion International will not sell, rent, or lease your personally identifiable information to others. Unless we have your permission or are required by law, we will only share the personal data you provide online with Compassion International entities and/or business partners who are acting on our behalf to complete the activities described above. Such Compassion International entities and/or business partners, including those located in other countries, are governed by our privacy policies with respect to the use of this data. 

****

**Choice**

Compassion International will not use or share the personally identifiable information, which you provide to us online, in ways unrelated to the ones described above without first letting you know and offering you a choice. As previously stated, you may let us know if you do not wish to receive unsolicited direct marketing materials from us, and we will do everything we can to honor such requests. 

****

**Accuracy and Access**

Compassion International strives to keep your personally identifiable information accurate. We make every effort to provide you with online access to your sponsor registration data so that you may update or correct your information at the Compassion International site where it was submitted. To protect your privacy and security, we will also take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting you access or enabling you to make corrections.

**Security**

Compassion International is committed to ensuring the security of your information. To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the appropriate use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online. We use Internet encryption software, Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol, when collecting or transferring sensitive data such as credit card information.
