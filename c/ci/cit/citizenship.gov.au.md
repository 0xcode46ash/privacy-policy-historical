# Web privacy statement

​The _Privacy Act 1988_ defines personal information as meaning information or an opinion about an identified individual, or an individual who is reasonably identifiable: whether the information or opinion is true or not; and whether the information or opinion is recorded in a material form or not. 

This website is managed by the Department. We take our obligation to protect your privacy seriously.

The _Privacy Act 1988_ is the key law designed to protect your rights and prevent misuse of your personal information collected by government agencies such as this department.

Also, information received by us is protected from unauthorised use and disclosure by virtue of specific provisions in the _Migration Act 1958_ , _Crimes Act 1914_ , _Public Service Act 1999_ and the _Public Service Regulations 1999_.

A breach of these laws might incur criminal and/or civil liability.

We might collect personal information from you when you visit this site. You can generally visit this site without telling us who you are, unless you choose to provide such information.

Our website contains links to other sites. We are not responsible for the content and the privacy practices of other websites and we encourage you to read each site's privacy policy.

### Security of information

We operate under the [Protective Security Framework](http://www.protectivesecurity.gov.au/) (PSPF), published by the Attorney-General's Department, which provides direction on our information security management policies.

The PSPF ensures that:

  * all official information is safeguarded to ensure its confidentiality, integrity, and availability by applying safeguards so that: 
    * only authorised people, using approved processes, access information
    * information is only used for its official purpose, retains its content integrity, and is available to satisfy operational requirements
    * information is classified and labelled as required.
  * all information created, stored, processed, or transmitted in or over government information and communication technology (ICT) systems is properly managed and protected throughout all phases of a system's life cycle, in accordance with the protocols and guidelines set out in the PSPF, which includes the Australian Government Information Security Manual, produced by the Australian Signals Directorate.



### Site visit data

A record of each visit to our site is logged. Information is recorded for statistical purposes and is used by us to monitor the use of the site, discover what information is most and least accessed and to make the site more useful.

The information we log when you access our website includes:

  * your IP or server address
  * the date and time of your visit to the site
  * the pages or files accessed by you
  * your operating system

We might also collect information about the IT device you use. This information could be used to identify you to assist us to carry out our functions and activities.
