# Immigration Department Website: Privacy Statement

The _Privacy Act 1988_ defines personal information as '....information, about an individual whose identity is apparent or can be reasonably ascertained from the information or opinion'.

The Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (DIMA) treats personal information as confidential. Information received by DIMA is protected from unauthorised disclosure by virtue of the _Migration Act 1958, Crimes Act 1914,_ the _Privacy Act 1988, Public Service Act 1999_ and the Public Service Regulations 1999. A breach of these laws makes an officer liable to criminal and/or civil penalty.

## Security of information

The _Migration Act 1958_ has specific provisions that prohibit any officer of DIMA (or any other government department) from accessing, recording or disclosing anyone's personal information except in performing their duties or in specific situations permitted by migration laws. Along with the legislation mentioned above, the Migration Act has severe penalties for breaking these provisions. 

Your personal information will not be released unless the law permits it or your permission is given. While DIMA provides a secure environment, you should be aware there are inherent risks associated with the transmission of information via the Internet. For those who do not wish to use the Internet, DIMA provides alternate ways (for example, fax, letter and office visits) of obtaining and providing information. For alternative contact details, please see the relevant entry in the DIMA [World Index](https://web.archive.org/wwi/contents.htm). In some circumstances, DIMA guidelines may require us to send particular information by non-electronic means.

To improve security, some (not all) of the electronic forms that include personal information have been secured under the HTTPS protocol ( **H** yper **T** ext **T** ransport **P** rotocol **S** ecure). HTTPS is a standard Web communication protocol that encrypts and decrypts a message for online transmission. In Netscape Navigator 3.0 and earlier, the broken key symbol in the lower-left corner of your browser window becomes solid when you are in secure mode. In Netscape Communicator 4.0 and above, the padlock symbol in the corner, usually open, is closed in secure mode. In Internet Explorer 4.0 and above, a closed padlock appears when you are in secure mode.

## Site visit data

This website is operated by DIMA with outsourced technical assistance. When visiting this site, a record of your visit is logged.

  * the time taken to transmit the information to the user. 



No attempt is made to identify users or their browsing activities except in the event of an investigation into apparent improper use of the Department's Internet facility, or where a law enforcement agency exercises a warrant to inspect the Internet Service Provider's logs.

## Cookies

## Collection, use and disclosure of personal information

When the Department receives your email or fill-in form, your message becomes accessible to staff, and your email address may be recorded. However, personal information provided to us will be treated confidentially and will only be used and/or disclosed in accordance with your consent and/or the provisions of the Migration and Privacy Acts.
