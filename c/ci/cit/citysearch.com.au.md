This policy applies to CitySearch® and explains how CitySearch® uses personal information collected through the CitySearch® sites. CitySearch® is owned, and the CitySearch® sites are operated on its behalf, by Sensis Pty Ltd, a wholly owned subsidiary of Telstra Corporation Limited.

CitySearch® is bound by the National Privacy Principles contained in the Commonwealth Privacy Act 1988. CitySearch® may, from time to time, review and update this privacy policy statement to take account of new laws and technology and changes to CitySearch®'s operations. All personal information held by CitySearch® will be governed by CitySearch®'s most recent policy, posted on this site 

**What kind of personal information CitySearch ® collects and how it is collected**  
CitySearch® may collect personal information about users, merchants, advertisers and other businesses, which access or are displayed on the CitySearch® site. Information about businesses that appear in the CitySearch® directory, including personal information of individuals within those businesses, may be generally collected by CitySearch® to manage the services or products that the business purchases from CitySearch®.

In general, the personal information CitySearch® collects may include (but is not limited to) name, address, contact details, gender, occupation, in some cases membership of professional associations and, where relevant, financial information, including credit card information, banking details and income information. 

Personal Information you provide: We store the personal information you enter on the CitySearch® site or otherwise give to CitySearch®. We obtain most personal information through the CitySearch® membership registration process and updates to membership details. You may provide information when you request or acquire a product or service from CitySearch® , provide a product or service to CitySearch®, complete a survey or questionnaire, enter a competition, participate in forums or when you communicate with CitySearch® by e-mail, telephone or in writing (for example if you contact customer service or provide feedback). 

Automatic collection: Cookies: We may use a feature of your browser called a cookie to assign your computer a 'User ID'. Cookies do not contain information by which CitySearch® can identify you. They identify your computer to our servers. You may configure your browser so that you are notified before a cookie is downloaded or so that your browser does not accept cookies. CitySearch® may use information contained in cookies to make assumptions about the user of the computer and to provide users of that computer with focused advertising which CitySearch® believes may be of interest, based on that information. To disable your cookies, please refer to the help menu within your Internet browser.

Indirect collection: CitySearch® endeavours to collect personal information about an individual only from that individual. In some circumstances CitySearch® may obtain personal information from a third party. If you provide personal information about another person to CitySearch®, CitySearch® requires that you inform that person you have done so and provide them with a copy of this policy. 

**How Citysearch ® uses the information you provide**  
CitySearch® may use information it collects from you for the primary purpose for which it is collected and for such other secondary purposes that are related to the primary purpose of collection. 

CitySearch® generally uses personal information to: 
  * provide you with products or services you have requested; 
  * personalise and customise your experiences on the CitySearch® sites; 
  * help CitySearch® manage and enhance its services; 
  * communicate with you; 
  * provide you with ongoing information about opportunities on the CitySearch® sites in which CitySearch® believes you may be interested; and 
  * give you the opportunity from time to time to receive e-mail and 'e-newsletters' from CitySearch®. 

In most cases where CitySearch® asks you to provide information about yourself, if you do not provide CitySearch® with that information, CitySearch® will not be able to provide you with the requested product or service. 

If you do not wish CitySearch® to contact you regarding other services or marketing, please call 1800 039 059. 

**Disclosure**  
CitySearch® may disclose personal information to Sensis, Telstra or related companies which may only use it as set out above. CitySearch® may also disclose personal information about persons within businesses that appear in the CitySearch® directory to third parties, including CitySearch®'s advertisers, business partners and information brokers. 

If you contact a merchant appearing in the CitySearch® directory, including via e-mail, this policy does not apply to such communications and CitySearch® accepts no responsibility for any transaction entered into between you and the relevant merchant.

CitySearch® uses DoubleClick International Asia B.V. to deliver the e-mails and e-newsletters you may ask to receive. If you would like to know more about the information gathering practices and 'opt-out' procedures of DoubleClick International, visit:http://www.doubleclick.net/us/corporate/privacy/privacy/default.asp?asp_object_1=& CitySearch® shares web site usage information about visitors to the CitySearch® sites who have received a targeted promotional e-mail campaign, with DoubleClick International B.V. for the purpose of targeting future campaigns and upgrading visitor information used in reporting statistics. For this purpose, CitySearch® and its third-party advertising company will keep information on the email campaign and some of the pages you visit on the CitySearch® sites through the use of pixel tags (also called clear gifs). For more information about our advertising company, visit www.privacychoices.org. To opt out of the targeting program, please visit www.privacychoices.org/optout.htm If CitySearch® sells part of its business, personal information may be part of the assets transferred to the purchaser. 

The CitySearch® sites contain features where you are invited to send personal information to organisations other than CitySearch®. The choice to send such information to these organisations is entirely yours. You should be aware that any such information you choose to send will not be bound by this policy. 

**How Citysearch ® treats sensitive information**  
"Sensitive Information" means information relating to a person's racial or ethnic origin, membership of political bodies, religion, membership of a trade union or professional or trade association, sexual preferences, criminal record and health. 

CitySearch® may use and disclose Sensitive Information only for the purpose for which it was provided or a directly related secondary purpose or as allowed by law unless you have agreed otherwise. 

**Management and security of personal information**   
CitySearch® protects the personal information it holds from misuse, loss, unauthorised access, modification or disclosure by various means including firewalls, password access, secure servers and encryption of credit card transactions.  **Updating personal information**  
CitySearch® endeavours to ensure that the personal information it holds is accurate, complete and up-to-date. You can update your CitySearch® membership information via the 'Update your details' section on any of the CitySearch® sites. 

You can generally update personal information that is not membership information on the website of the CitySearch® site where you submitted that information. Where personal information is no longer required by CitySearch®, it will be destroyed or de-identified. 

**Seeking access to the personal information Citysearch ® holds about you**  
You have the right to seek access the personal information held about you and to advise CitySearch® of any inaccuracy. There are some exceptions to this right set out in the Privacy Act. 

If you make an access request, CitySearch® will ask you to verify your identity and specify what information you require. CitySearch® may charge a fee to cover the costs of meeting your request. Membership information: CitySearch® Members can access the membership information CitySearch® holds about them at any time via the 'Update your details' section on any of the CitySearch® sites. 

**Are my children at risk using the CitySearch ® sites?**  
The safety of children is very important to us. We ask that children under the age of 16 have a parent or guardian verify their registration on web sites and the submission of online forms. While CitySearch® and its affiliation sites will make every reasonable effort to ensure that children's privacy and other rights are not compromised, it is ultimately the responsibility of parents or guardians to monitor their children's internet usage. Children should always ask a parent before sending any transmission over the internet.  **Third Party Sites**  
CitySearch® acknowledges that you will click through to third party sites from our sites, and thus recommends that you refer to the privacy statement of the sites you visit. CitySearch®'s privacy statement is applicable for CitySearch® and its affiliate sites (as listed above), and assumes no responsibility for information and content of third party sites.  **How to contact Citysearch ®**  
To make an access request, please contact us on 1800 039 059 or write to the Privacy Officer at Locked Bag 5782, Melbourne, VIC, 8100.
