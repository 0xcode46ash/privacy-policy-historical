# CitySearch Privacy Policy

|  |   
---  
  
**Our commitment to your Privacy.**  
CitySearch Australia Pty. Ltd. ('CitySearch') will not sell, trade or rent any personally identifiable information obtained from you to a third party.  
It is policy at CitySearch to allow our users to provide as much - or as little - personal information to us as they feel comfortable doing. 

**Information Gathered**  
Unless you specifically tell us, CitySearch will never know who you are. You may, however, elect to tell us things that you want us to remember. We hope that, like many of our users and customers, you will want to provide information about yourself to CitySearch because it will help us to make our sites and services more valuable to you.   
The choice of how much personally identifiable information about yourself you disclose to CitySearch is left completely up to you, our valued customer.  
But however you choose to interact with CitySearch, you have our commitment to your privacy. 

**What information does CitySearch gather?**   
We will ask you when we need information that personally identifies you or allows us to contact you ("Personal Information").   
Generally Personal Information is requested when you register for a site, when you request a particular service or information from us, when you use QuoteBank, when you choose to complete a survey, or when you enter a competition or promotion.   
Information gathered is stored by CitySearch on a secure site protected by 'firewalls'. 

**We track traffic patterns throughout sites.**   
We may use a feature of your browser called a "cookie" to assign a "User ID."   
Cookies, by themselves, cannot be used to find out your identity or the identities' of any of our users.   
They only identify your computer to our servers when you visit our site.  
Companies placing advertising on our sites and the sites of other web publishers may have the ability to assign a different cookie to you by a process that CitySearch does not control.  
However as cookies don't identify individuals (you'll just be a number to them), companies will not know who you are - and CitySearch will not tell them. 

**When You Disclose Information to Third Parties**  
Please note that when: ****

  1. you sign up for a merchant's postcard (via Personalise); 
  2. you communicate with a merchant via the "email this business" facility on their website; 
  3. you complete "book a table" & "book a room" forms or any other interactive forms; or 
  4. you utilise the "QuoteBank" facility, 

you are communicating directly with and providing information to a third party merchant over which CitySearch does not exercise control.   
CitySearch is not responsible for a third party merchant's use of the information you send to it, nor for the privacy policies of those third party merchants. 

**You Are In Control of All Information Gathered About You**  
Our 'open book' information policy means you can access the information you have given us and make any changes you deem appropriate.  
Personal details and your profile, are of course user name and password protected so that only you or someone you have authorized can gain access to this information. 

**Why do we gather the Information and how will we use it?**  
CitySearch aims to provide you with better services and more compelling reasons to come back and visit our sites:  
In the future, we may use the information you provide us with to provide personalised portions of our sites to you that are intended to provide just the information you are interested in receiving.   
We analyse what our users and customers like and don't like about the content, products and services on CitySearch sites so that we can constantly improve them for your use.  
In the future, we may also use information you have given us to help focus the advertisements that are shown on our sites, hopefully to make them of more interest to you.  
We develop summary - not individual - reports for our advertisers. An example of a summary report might be "12,000 people clicked on advertisement "X" today and they were in the Film section of the site."   
The people that help make it possible for CitySearch to provide our sites for free - our advertisers - use this information to determine how effective their advertising investments are.   
We do not tell our advertisers who it was that saw or clicked on their advertisements and do not sell, trade or rent them any of your personal information.   
Occasionally, we will send you email communications to provide information which we think you will find useful, including information about new products and services from CitySearch.  
It is our policy only to send email to customers who give us permission to do so.   
In every such email, we will also have instructions on how you may unsubscribe from the email list so that you will not receive any future emails if you do not wish to - see the "Opt-out Policy " below. 

**Security. Is my Information safe?**  
When you access your membership information, we offer the use of a secure server.   
The secure server software (SSL) encrypts all information you input before it is sent to us.   
Furthermore, all of the data we collect is protected by 'firewalls' against unauthorized access. 

**Opt-In/Opt-Out Policy**  
CitySearch puts control over communications directed to you where it belongs: In your hands:   
We only send our email newsletters to users who ask to receive them.   
Once you are on the list - you can easily get off.   
Each email newsletter you receive has simple instructions on how to immediately unsubscribe from our newsletter list.   
To do this you must use the email addresses you specified at the time of becoming a Member or joining an email newsletter list.  
If you change or move email addresses please let us know so we can redirect your email to your new address.

**In Summary**  
CitySearch is committed to protecting your privacy.   
We use the information we collect on our sites to make our services the best they can be and to enhance your overall experience.   
We do not sell, trade or rent your personal information to others.   
Our 'open book' information policy means you can access the information we have collected about you at any time or make any changes you deem appropriate.   
CitySearch may disclose personal information if required to do so by law.
