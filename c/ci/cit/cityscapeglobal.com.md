We take privacy seriously and we are committed to protecting your personal information. This privacy policy is designed to tell you what information is being collected about you, how personal information is being used, to whom personal data is being disclosed and how this personal information is stored and protected so that you can make an informed choice about using this site. This privacy policy has been developed in accordance with our legal obligations. 

  **What Information Do We Collect?

We may collect the domain name, IP address and e-mail address (where possible) of visitors to our Web page, the e-mail addresses of those who communicate with us via e-mail, aggregate information on what pages visitors access or visit, user-specific information on what pages visitors access or visit and information volunteered by the visitors, such as survey information, and/or site registrations. 

When you register yourself or purchase a product on this site, we ask for your name, e-mail address, company name, address, post code, phone number, job title, industry, and business interests. We will also collect your credit card details where you purchase any products or services from us. We may also ask for the contact details of other individuals within your organisation such as your approving manager or booking contact. If you are asked to provide details about other people, please ensure that these individuals are happy for their details to be given to the Informa Group and used for the purposes set out in this policy (which may include using their details for marketing purposes).

In order to tailor our subsequent communications to you and continuously improve our products and services, we may also ask you to provide us with information regarding your professional interests, experience with our products, and more detailed contact preferences. 

Where you provide us with any sensitive personal information (such as dietary or disability information) in connection with a booking for an event, we will only use this information in connection with the relevant event to serve your particular need. We do not retain this information in our database. 

  **Use of Personal Information

We use your personal information and other information collected from you to manage your registration, provide you with information that you request (e.g. conference papers, details of events) and to improve the content of our website and the service you receive from us.

The personal information shown or provided by you, will be held on a database and may be shared with companies in the Informa Group in the UAE and internationally. These companies will use your information to provide you with information about Informa products and services which they think will be of interest to you. For more information about the types of marketing we carry out, please see section entitled “Direct Marketing” below. 

We may employ the services of a third party to help us in certain areas, such as website hosting or marketing campaigns. In some cases, the third party may receive your information. However, at all times we will control and be responsible for the use of your information.

We may use aggregated information for the purposes of tracking website usage and in order to help improve our website and for research and analysis purposes. We may pass this information to third parties. The aggregate information and statistics will not, however, include details that can be used to identify you.

Sometimes your details may be made available to carefully selected third parties such as our sponsors or partners for their own marketing purposes. 

  **Use of Cookies and other tracking technologies  
**    
Our website uses a variety of technical methods for tracking purposes including cookies. A cookie is a small text file written to a user's hard drive that contains the User ID. The cookies record those areas of the site that have been visited by the computer in question, and for how long. The use of cookies and tracking technologies is now widespread by sites in order to track traffic flows. We use cookies and other tracking technologies to enable us to offer certain time-saving features to our users such as, one-time log in, global-site shopping cart functionality and pre-populating name and address fields. If a user sets up his browser to reject the cookie or tracking technology, he or she may still use the site although functionality will be impaired. You can find out more about the use of cookies and how to disable/enable them on [http://www.cookiecentral.com](http://www.cookiecentral.com/). 

We may combine your visitor session information or other information collected through tracking technologies with personally identifiable information in order to understand and measure your online experiences and to determine what products, promotions and services are likely to be of interest to you.

We also use these technical methods in HTML emails that we send to our visitors for a number of purposes including: to determine whether our visitors have opened or forwarded those emails and/or clicked on links in those emails; to customise the display of banner advertisements and other messages after a visitor has closed an email; and to determine whether a visitor has made an enquiry or a purchase in response to a particular email.

Cookies and other technical methods may involve the transmission of information either directly to us or to another party authorised by us to collect information on our behalf. The information from use of these technical methods may be collected in a form that is personally identifiable. 

  **Log Files  
**    
We use cookies and log files to administer the site, track users' movements and actions, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. The information gathered can thus be used to improve the site and the user experience. 

  **Direct Marketing**

 In order to provide you with a better service, the Informa Group and other carefully selected third parties (such as our sponsors and partners) would like to use your personal information to send you information about their products and services which they think may be of interest to you.

The Informa Group and other carefully selected third parties may send you mailings by post or call you or send you emails, SMS’ and faxes unless you have told us that you do not want to be contacted in this way.

   **Period of Grace  
**    
We will endeavour to update your records as promptly as practical; however you may receive communications for a transitional period whilst we process your records. 

  **Security  
**    
This website takes every precaution to protect and maintain the security of your information. While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and 

Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to unlocked, or open, as will be the case for most of the time that a user is browsing the web. However, the Internet is an open system and we cannot guarantee that unauthorised third parties will never be able to defeat those measures or use your personal information for improper purposes. 

  **Hyperlinks and third party advertising  
**    
This site contains links to other websites. Their inclusion cannot be taken to imply any endorsement or validation by us of the content of the said website. We are not responsible for the privacy practices nor do we accept any liability in connection with the content of such websites. We may use third party advertisements on our site. Cookies may be associated with these advertisements to enable the advertiser to track the number of anonymous users responding to the campaign. We do not have access to or control of cookies placed by third parties. 

  **Sale of the Business  
**    
In the event that the business is sold or integrated with another business, your details will be disclosed to our advisers and any prospective purchaser’s adviser and will be passed to the new owners of the business. 

  **Changes/Updates to Privacy Policy  
**    
In order to keep up with changing legislation and best practice, we may revise this privacy policy at any time without notice so please check back periodically so that you are aware of any changes.
