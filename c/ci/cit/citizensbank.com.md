**Citizens Bank Web Site Policy on Privacy**

**Protecting Your Privacy**  
At Citizens Bank we know that our customers may share highly sensitive personal and financial information with us. We understand the need to keep such information secure. As a result, we've developed the following policy so you'll know how we handle information we learn about you from your visit to our web site. 

**When Information is Collected And Not Collected**  
Anytime you visit, we may collect and store the name of the domain from which you access the Internet (for example aol.com, if you are connecting from an America Online account, or uri.edu if you are connecting from the University of Rhode Island's domain); the date and time; the Internet address of the web site you left to visit us and the names of the pages you visit on our site. We use the information we collect to measure the number of visitors to different sections of our web site, and to help us make our site more useful. 

Some areas of our Web site require information, such as your e-mail address or phone number, to enable you to correspond with us. In these cases, we collect your information necessary to interact with you. If you do not interact with us, any personal information, such as your e-mail address, is not collected. 

**Protecting Your Online Applications Or Enrollment Forms**  
The application or enrollment forms on the Citizens Bank Web site use Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology to transfer your information across the Internet to us. This technology encrypts - or scrambles - the information you provide so it's virtually impossible for anyone other than Citizens Bank to read it. We use this technology whenever confidential information, such as your account number or social security number is requested. However, in some cases we give you the option of sending information to us in an unencrypted mode. We will always inform you if we detect you are using a browser that does not support encryption. 

**How We Handle E-Mail**  
If you send us e-mail, we may retain the content of the e-mail and your e-mail address in order to respond to questions or concerns that you may have. 

**E-mail is not necessarily secure against interception. If your communication is very sensitive, or includes personal information such as your account numbers, credit card number or social security number, you may want to call us or send it through the U.S. Post Office instead.**

To help ensure secure transmissions, your e-mails to us should be sent using the Citizens Bank Online "Talk To Us" page. Inquiries sent through our "Talk To Us" page is secure and use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology. Since we can not ensure our response back to you is secure, we will not include confidential account information in the response.
