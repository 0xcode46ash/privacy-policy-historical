**Cookies**

A cookie is a small data file that certain Web sites write to your hard drive when you visit them. A cookie file can contain information such as a user ID that the site uses to track the pages you've visited. But the only personal information a cookie can contain is information you supply yourself. Generally, cookies work by assigning a unique number to the user that has no meaning outside the assigning site. A cookie can't read data off your hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites. This random number lets us keep track of "how many" times customers are doing specific things- like visiting our site each month - without really knowing who those customers are. We also use cookies to keep track of your shopping cart and to make sure you don't see the same ad repeatedly. We use cookies to deliver content specific to your interests and to save your member ID. Additionally, after you've entered your member ID and password during a session on our service, we save that information so you don't have to reenter it repeatedly during that session.

User should be aware that Times-Shamrock websites cannot control the use of cookies or the resulting information by advertisers or third parties hosting data for Times-Shamrock websites. If a user does not want information collected through the use of cookies, there is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows the user to deny or accept the cookie feature; however, users should note that cookies may be necessary to provide the user with certain features (e.g., customized delivery of information available on the Times-Shamrock network of web sites).

**Surveys**

Our online surveys ask visitors for their E-mail address and demographic information. Demographic and profile data is also collected at our site. We use this data to tailor our visitors experience at our site, showing them content and promotional offers that we think they might be interested in, and displaying the content according to their preferences. This information is shared with advertisers only on an aggregate basis. We may use contact data from our surveys to send the user information about our company and promotional material from Times-Shamrock websites or some of our partners. Users may opt out of receiving future mailings in Personal Options.

**Contests**

We run contests on our sites in which we ask visitors for Times-Shamrock websites ID and password. We use contact data from our contests to send users information about upcoming contests and promotional offers. On occasion we will E-mail customers promotional material from some of our partners. The customer's contact information is also used to contact the visitor when necessary for winner notification and prize delivery confirmation. The majority of the contests that we offer are hosted on Times-Shamrock sites; however, there may be cases in which a third party sponsor will host the contest and collect user information. In those cases, we urge users to review the privacy statement of the third party site. Users may opt out of receiving future mailings in Personal Options.

**Changes**

Times-Shamrock websites reserve the right to change this Privacy Policy without notice. In the event of a change of this policy, procedures will be developed for users to opt-out or otherwise prohibit any future use of their individually identifiable information that is not currently covered under this policy.
