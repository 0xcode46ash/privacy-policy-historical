# Privacy Policy - City Index

(1) City Index is subject to data protection legislation in the UK. We are therefore committed to protecting your privacy and maintaining the security of any personal information that we receive from you. If our Privacy Policy changes, we will place an updated version on this page.

(2) The purpose of this statement is to explain to you what personal information we collect and how we and our associated companies may use it.

(3). The personal information we hold is only used for establishing and managing your account, to help us identify you when you contact us and supplying you with information regarding opportunities that we believe may be of interest to you. As a result we may send you marketing material from time to time by email, telephone, fax or other electronic messaging service unless you indicate to us that you would prefer not to receive it. If you do not wish to receive this information, please [contact us](http://cityindex.co.uk/support/contact_us.aspx).

(4) We, and our associated companies, may disclose your personal information to successors in title to our business and suppliers we engage to process data on our behalf. However, we do not sell, rent or exchange your personal information with any third party for commercial reasons, beyond the essential requirement for debit card validation when depositing or withdrawing funds, credit agencies should you wish to open a credit account with City Index and fraud prevention agencies.

(5) However, where required by law, your personal information may also be disclosed to an applicable governmental, regulatory or enforcement authority. These authorities may then use your personal information to investigate and act on any breach of law or regulatory rules in accordance with their procedures.

(6) In accordance with the UK data protection legislation we follow strict security procedures in the storage and disclosure of information that you have given us, to prevent unauthorised access.

(7) You have the right at any time to request a copy of the personal data that we hold on you (for which we may charge a small fee) and to correct any inaccuracies. In order to maintain the accuracy of our data base, you can update your personal details by telephone.
