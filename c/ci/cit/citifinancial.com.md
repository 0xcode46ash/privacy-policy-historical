** At CitiFinancialÂ®, we are dedicated to protecting your privacy. On occasion, we will ask for your email address and want you to feel comfortable about giving it to us. The following Email Policy was developed to help you understand how we use email and what your choices are.

When you give us your email address, you are giving us permission to contact you via email. We may then send you emails on a variety of subjects, such as:

  * Confirmation of receipt of your loan application 
  * Updates on special deals and offers that might interest you.
