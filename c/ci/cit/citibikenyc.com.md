# Privacy Policy | Citi Bike NYC

  
**I. PURPOSE**

NYC Bike Share, LLC ("NYCBS", "Our", or "We") values your privacy. The purpose of this Privacy Policy is to disclose (i) the information that We may collect, (ii) the way We may use the information, and (iii) how We may disclose the information to others. This Privacy Policy is part of Our Website Terms of Use Agreement ("Agreement") and is incorporated into the Agreement. By visiting www.citibikenyc.com ("Website") you accept and consent to this Privacy Policy. All capitalized terms used herein but not otherwise defined are defined in the Agreement.

**II. INFORMATION COLLECTION, USE, AND DISCLOSURE**

Information Collected by NYCBS: The information that We learn from you helps us to personalize and improve your experience on the Website. Most of the information that we collect is the information that you give to us. We receive and may store any information that you enter on the Website or give to us in any other way from time to time, including, but not limited to, your name, street address, email address, phone number, and other contact information. You might also provide NYCBS with certain financial information, via the Website or otherwise. In addition, we may collect billing, shipping, and other information that you provide to purchase a subscription, and We may collect other supplemental information from third parties. For example, if you incur a debt to NYCBS, We may conduct a credit check by obtaining additional information about you from a credit bureau, as permitted by law; or, if the information you provide cannot be verified, We may ask you to send us additional information, such as your driver license, credit card statement, or utility bill to confirm your address, or we may ask you to answer additional questions online. You can always choose not to provide any information, but then you might not be able to take advantage of many of the Website's features. Like most standard website servers, We use log files to collect Internet Protocol ("IP") addresses, browser type, Internet Service Provider ("ISP"), referring/exit pages, platform type, and date/time stamp. We may use the information to analyze site usage, administer the site, understand usage and navigation trends in the aggregate, and determine the relevance of content. IP addresses are also linked to personally identifiable information, to better the user's experience when using the Website. Although, We have no obligation to do so, We may also retain any email, letter, or other correspondence between you and NYCBS, to ensure quality control.

**Information Used by NYCBS:** Information supplied by you to NYCBS, which is personally identifiable information, may be used by NYCBS to serve you and to operate and maintain Our services. For example, We may use the information to respond to your requests, to customize future use of the Website for you, to improve our Website, and to communicate with you. We do not use personally identifiable information without your consent for any commercial or marketing purpose; however, We may use your email address or information without your consent, for non-commercial, non-marketing, or administrative purposes. We may use a credit card processing company to bill users for purchases made on the Website. Those companies may or may not retain, share, store, or use personally identifiable information for secondary purposes. We reserve the right to partner with any third party to provide specific services. When the user signs up for those services, we may share names or other contact information that may be necessary for the third party to provide those services.

**Information Disclosed by NYCBS:** While We may receive information about you from other sources and add it to your account information, We will not sell or provide any personally identifiable information to third parties in any manner that is different from what is disclosed in this Privacy Policy. Information about our customers is an important part of our business, but We are not in the business of selling any personally identifiable information to others. We reserve the right, however, to disclose personally identifiable information that We believe is necessary or appropriate to enforce Our rights under this Agreement; and, information may be disclosed or used (i) to investigate or defend against any allegation or claim against NYCBS or involving Our services, (ii) to assist government enforcement agencies, or (iii) to protect the property rights and safety of anyone. NYCBS may release information if required to do so by law or if in good faith it is necessary to comply with any law. We also may exchange information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.

**III. PLEDGE TO SECURITY**

We take reasonable security precautions to protect our users' information. When our registration form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as a credit card number), that information is encrypted. If you have any question about the security at the Website, you can send an email to customerservice@citibikenyc.com. Although We intend to use reasonable security safeguards to protect the security of personal information, WE HAVE LIMITED CONTROL AND WE CANNOT PROVIDE OR GUARANTEE COMPLETE SECURITY OF ANY INFORMATION; THEREFORE, YOUR POSTING OR TRANSMITTING PERSONAL INFORMATION IS DONE AT YOUR SOLE RISK. If there is a serious breach in the security of NYCBS’s services, then We will attempt to contact you, to allow you to take further steps that may be necessary to protect your information. 

**IV. LINKS TO OTHER SITES**

If NYCBS is acquired by, or merged with, any other entity, We reserve the right to assign or transfer any information that We have collected; and, for any bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, receivership, or assignment for the benefit of creditors, or for any application of laws or equitable principles affecting creditors' rights, your information might be transferred or disclosed to third parties.
