**Collected Information**

Our website, as many other websites do, collects and records certain information such as domain names, host names, Internet Protocol (“IP”) addresses, browser software and operating system types, clickstream patterns, and dates and times that our website is accessed. Some of the pages on this website may use “cookies” and other tracking technologies. A “cookie” is a small data file placed and stored on your computer’s hard drive which allows our servers to identify the computer accessing our website in order to track statistical information about navigation through our website and whether that computer has previously visited our website. The cookie is not used to obtain Personal Information and the information is tracked only for internal purposes such as to improve site navigation, to monitor activity on the website, to diagnose problems with our servers, to administer our website, and to identify content preferences. We may also use Personal Information in connection with cookie data to provide you with additional information regarding content you have viewed and/or to suggest other of our products, services, and/or information which we believe may be of interest to you. If you prefer not to accept cookies, most browsers can be set to block them or to alert you before one is placed. It is your responsibility to set the appropriate parameters on your browser.

We may also use “web beacons” (also known as Internet tags, pixel tags, and clear GIF’s). Web beacons are used for internal purposes, such as to obtain the IP address of the computer that downloaded the page(s) on which the web beacon appears, the URL of the page(s) on which the web beacon appears, the time the page(s) containing the web beacon was viewed, and the type of browser used to view the page(s). We also retain service providers who use web beacons to assess the effectiveness of our e-mail and other communications and for us to learn what pages our visitors viewed and what appeals to them.
