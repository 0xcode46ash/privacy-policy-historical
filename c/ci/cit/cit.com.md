CIT may share your Personal Information under the following circumstances: 

_Affiliates_

: We may share your name, address and information about your transactions and experiences with us (such as your payment history or other facts about your account) with our affiliates. 

_Agents and service providers_

: To establish, administer, and manage our customers' accounts, evaluate credit, provide customer service and benefits, process account transactions and account statements, engage in collections activities, or process job applications, we may disclose your Personal Information to companies that work with us to perform services or business operations on our behalf.  We may also share your Personal Information with companies that perform marketing services on our behalf, or with other financial institutions (including insurance companies) with whom we have joint marketing agreements. 

_Nonaffiliated third parties_

: In certain instances, we are permitted or even required to disclose your Personal Information to nonaffiliated third parties.  For example, reporting your transaction history and information with us to credit reporting agencies, responding to regulators or auditors, to protect against fraud, or to provide information in connection with proposed or actual business transactions involving CIT companies or accounts.  We may also disclose your Personal Information to third parties when legally compelled to do so, such as to comply with the law, to enforce our terms of use, or to protect the rights, property, or safety of CIT, its employees, customers, visitors to these Services, and others.  Please be aware that these disclosures are permitted by law without your consent. 

_Other third parties_

: We may also share, as permitted by law, your Personal Information with other third parties with whom we do not have joint marketing agreements, such as other financial services providers, insurance companies, or with nonfinancial companies such as service organizations, retailers, travel services and direct marketers.  We require these companies to adhere to CIT's confidentiality standards with respect to your Personal Information. 

_USA Patriot Act Section 326 compliance_

: When you open an account with us, we will ask for your name, address, and other identifying documents such as your driver's license, that will allow us to identify you.  We do this to help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities.  U.S. federal law requires all financial institutions to obtain, verify and record information that identifies each person who opens an account. 

_Business transfers_

: As we develop our business, we may sell or buy businesses or assets, or be involved in mergers or other corporate reorganization.  In transactions such as these, your Personal Information may be shared in connection with any of the foregoing types of transactions, even prior to the existence of a final, binding, agreement to buy, sell, merge, or reorganize.
