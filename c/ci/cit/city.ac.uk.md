# City University, London - privacy policy

City University, London (referred to in this document as ‘the University’) is committed to protecting your privacy and developing technology that gives you the most powerful and safe online experience. This University Privacy Statement applies to the University and its group of websites (www.city.ac.uk and collective virtual sites – www. _name_.city.ac.uk) and governs data collection and usage at all the University sites and services worldwide. By using the University websites, you consent to the data practices described in this statement.

This privacy statement applies to all the University sites and services. Please read the complete University Privacy Statement below.

#### Collection of your personal information and the Data Protection Act 1998

At some sites, the University collects personally identifiable information, such as your e-mail address, name, home or work address or telephone number. At other sites, the University collects anonymous demographic information, which is not unique to you. Some sites collect a combination of the two types of information. Information collected at one of the University’s websites may be shared within the University as a whole including the University’s group of websites. Personal and demographic data may be stored and processed outside your country (if outside the United Kingdom) and by using the University’s website, you consent to any such transfers being made outside your country.

There is also information about your computer hardware and software that is automatically collected by the University and may be shared with other websites within the University’s group of websites. This information can include your IP address, browser type, domain names, access times and referring website addresses. This information is used by the University for the operation of the service, to maintain quality of the service, and to provide general statistics regarding use of the University websites.

Please keep in mind that if you directly disclose personally identifiable information or personally sensitive data through the University’s website, you are encouraged to review the privacy statements of websites you choose to link to from the University’s website so that you can understand how those websites collect, use and share your information. The University is not responsible for the privacy statements or other content on websites outside of the University and the University’s group of websites.

#### Use of your personal information

The University’s websites collect and use your personal information to operate the University websites and deliver the services you have requested. The University may also contact you via surveys to conduct research about your opinion of current services or of potential new services that may be offered.

The University does not sell, rent or lease its customer lists to third parties. The University may share data with trusted partners to help us perform statistical analysis, send you email or postal mail, provide customer support, or arrange for deliveries. All such third parties are prohibited from using your personal information except to provide these services to the University, and they are required to maintain the confidentiality of your information.

The University does not use or disclose sensitive personal information, such as race or religion, without your explicit consent.

The University keeps track of the websites and pages that our customers visit within the University, in order to determine what University sites and services are the most popular. This data is used to deliver customised content within the University to customers whose browsing behaviour indicates that they are interested in a particular subject area.

The University will disclose your personal information, without notice, only if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to (a) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on the University or the site; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of the University and its group of websites and, (c) act under exigent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of the University, its websites, or the public.

#### Use of cookies

The University’s websites may use "cookies" to help you personalise your online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.

One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you personalise the University pages, a cookie helps the University to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of recording your personal information, delivery addresses, and so on. When you return to the same University website, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the University features that you customised.

You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of the University services or websites you visit.

#### Security of your personal information

The University secures your personal information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. The University secures the personally identifiable information you provide on computer servers in a controlled, secure environment, protected from unauthorised access, use or disclosure. When personal information (such as a credit card number) is transmitted, it is protected through the use of encryption, such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol.

#### Changes to this statement

The University will occasionally update this Privacy Statement to reflect customer feedback. The University encourages you to periodically review this Statement to be informed of how the University is protecting your information.

#### Contact information

The University welcomes your comments regarding this Privacy Statement. If you believe that the University has not adhered to this Statement, please contact the University by [ e-mail](mailto:E.G.Martin@city.ac.uk). We will use commercially reasonable efforts to promptly determine and remedy the problem.
