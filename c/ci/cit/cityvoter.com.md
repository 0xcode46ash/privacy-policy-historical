# CityVoter :: Privacy Policy

* * *

##### The effective date of this Agreement is January 10, 2012.

CityVoter, Inc. ("CityVoter") is an online platform that helps people find products and services and tell consumers which businesses are the most popular based on annual contests. Part of our service includes soliciting and aggregating votes and user recommendations. Our users vote, share their favorites, create lists, ask questions, invite friends, and write recommendations about local businesses. These recommendations are posted on our web site (the "Site") or on web sites we create on behalf of certain media partners (the "Media Partners"). We also partner with merchants (the "Merchants") to sell discounted products and services on behalf of the Merchants. This privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") outlines the types of personal information we may collect when you use our service ("Service"), which is further described in the Terms of Service ("Terms and Conditions") available at [http://cityvoter.com/help/terms-and-conditions](https://web.archive.org/help/terms-and-conditions) as well as some of the steps we take to secure it. 

Voting results and recommendations can then be accessed and read by other CityVoter users. For the purposes of this Privacy Policy, a "user" is defined as someone using the CityVoter Site, and a "friend" is defined as someone you have explicitly invited to share questions or local information with you. 

By using CityVoter, you permit the collection and use of your personal information as outlined below. You should visit this page periodically to review any changes to the Privacy Policy. 

##### 1\. Information We Collect

If you purchase a Deal Voucher (as defined in the Terms and Conditions) we refer you to a third-party Payment Vendor (as defined in the Terms and Conditions) who will collect your credit card information to complete the transaction.
