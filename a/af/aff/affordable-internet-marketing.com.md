**Privacy Policy**

  * On our website  
We are strongly committed to safeguarding subscribers' privacy on anownsite.com.  
To be honest, although we love every one of our visitors dearly, we don't have any interest in what you, as an individual, are doing at the site!  
But we are more interested in what you as a herd are doing. We want to know how you got here, what pages you tend to visit, and what pages you don't tend to visit.

Every request to any site results in some data send from the requestor to that site. Servers automatically detect such information **IF available**.  
We use a script to view such information that is made available on our servers.  
For each visitor to our site, our server automatically recognizes statistics about where you came from, the pages followed, what kind of browser you use and the IP-address you have and the domain name.

The information we collect is used for internal review to improve the content of our site and to customize the content and/or layout of our page for each individual browser. After doing so, the information is then discarded.

We do **NOT collect any e-mail address** of visitors to our site (it just isn't possible) unless you specifically ask for information provided by us.

In our newsletter we bring you the latest news we personally have discovered on the Internet. It may contain endorsements for products from different owners/manufacturors, but it will never contain any commercial messages from third parties that we can not personally endorse.

**You can always OPT-OUT!**  
In every message we send you there will always be an unsubscribe option. You can use that or send an email with subject UNSUBSCRIBE to unsubscribe@-NOSPAM-anownsite.com (please delete -NOSPAM-) to delete your data from our files, **permenantly**!  
There's **NO WAY** of reversing this.
