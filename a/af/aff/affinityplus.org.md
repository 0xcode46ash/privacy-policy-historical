**This Privacy Policy**

This privacy policy describes the current Web site policies and practices of Affinity Plus with regard to personal data collected by Affinity Plus through this Web site.

**Information Collection and Use**

Affinity Plus Federal Credit Union is the sole owner of the information collected on Affinity Plus' Web site. We will not share, sell or rent this information to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement. Affinity Plus collects information from our members at several different points on our Web site. We collect, retain, and use information about you only where we reasonably believe that it will help administer our business or enable us to provide products, services, and other opportunities to you. We use this information about you only for specific business purposes – and we will tell you why we are collecting and retaining it upon your request. We use your information to protect and administer your records, accounts and funds, to comply with certain laws and regulations, to help us design or improve our products and services and to understand your financial needs so that we can provide you with quality products and superior service.

**Cookies**

A cookie is a piece of data stored on a computer's hard drive, which contains information about the Web site visitor. Cookies do not contain information that can personally identify you. On Affinity Plus' Web site, cookies enable us to track and target the interests of our visitors, to enhance their experience on our site. Once the visitor closes their browser, the cookie simply terminates. We also incorporate cookies on our home page that display an image when new items are added to our quick links list. These particular cookies terminate on a specified date, usually one to two weeks after they are created. If a visitor rejects the cookie, they may still use our site.

**Log Files**

We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track which pages our Web site visitors view and gather broad demographic information for collective use. IP addresses are not linked to information that can personally identify you.

**Children**

Affinity Plus does not knowingly collect personal data from children under the age of eighteen on our Web site. If you are under eighteen, please do not give us any personal data. If you have reason to believe that a child has provided personal data to Affinity Plus' Web site, please contact us, and we will endeavor to delete that information from our databases.

**Registrations or Applications**

In order to use certain features of this Web site, a member must first complete a registration form or application. These forms may require a member to give their contact information (such as name and e-mail address). This information is used to contact the member about the services on our site for which they have expressed interest. It is sometimes required for the member to provide demographic information (such as income level), and unique identifiers (such as social security number). This information is used to process requests such as loan and membership applications. Without this information we may not be able to process your request. All information gathered is subject to our information collection and use standards detailed in this statement.

**Communication by E-mail**

You may use Affinity Plus' Web site to contact Affinity Plus Federal Credit Union. Affinity Plus only uses any information you send us by e-mail internally. We will respond to all e-mail messages in a prompt and proper manner.

**Restrictions on Disclosing Information to Parties Outside of Affinity Plus**

We do not reveal specific information about your accounts or other personally identifiable data to parties outside of Affinity Plus for their independent use unless: 

  1. you request or authorize it;
  2. the information is provided to help complete a transaction initiated by you;
  3. the information is provided to a reputable credit bureau or similar information reporting agency; or
  4. the disclosure otherwise is lawfully permitted or required.



We do not provide account or personal information to outside companies for the purpose of independent telemarketing or direct-mail marketing of any non-financial products or services of those companies. Sometimes it is necessary to provide personally identifiable information about you to a party outside of Affinity Plus, such as to a vendor or service company that we hire to prepare your account statements or to provide support or services for one or more of our products. These vendors and service companies agree to safeguard our confidential information about you and your products and services with us and must abide by applicable law.

**Links**

Affinity Plus' Web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices, content or operation of such other sites. These links are provided for your reference and convenience only. We encourage our members to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each Web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by Affinity Plus on our Web site.

**Newsletter**

If a member wishes to subscribe to our newsletter, we ask for contact information such as name and e-mail address.

**Surveys & Contests**

From time-to-time Affinity Plus requests information from members on our Web site via surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and the member therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information. Information requested may include contact information (such as name and address), and demographic information (such as zip code and age level). Contact information will be used to notify the winners and award prizes. Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and member satisfaction of Affinity Plus' Web site and other Affinity Plus products and services.

**Special Offers**

Established members will occasionally receive information on products, services, special deals and a newsletter. Out of respect for the privacy of our members we present the option to not receive these types of communications. Please see our choice and opt-out section below.

**Correction/Updating Personal Information**

We have procedures to help assure that your financial and personal information is accurate, current and complete in accordance with commercial standards. We also have procedures to respond to your requests to correct inaccurate information in a timely manner. While federal or state law requires some of these procedures, we have implemented additional procedures to maintain accurate, current and complete information, including processes to update information and remove outdated information. If your personal information has changed, you may notify us by e-mail at [affinityplus@affinityplus.org](mailto:affinityplus@affinityplus.org) or by phone at (651) 291-3700 or (800) 322-7228.

**Choice/Opt-out**

Members who no longer wish to receive our newsletter or promotional materials from Affinity Plus' Web site or our partners may opt-out of receiving these communications by e-mailing us at affinityplus@affinityplus.org . You may also opt-out by mail to:

Affinity Plus Federal Credit Union   
175 W. Lafayette Rd.   
St. Paul, MN 55107

Visitors to Affinity Plus' Web site are notified when their information is being collected by any outside parties. We do this so our visitors can make an informed choice as to whether or not they should proceed with services that require an outside party.

**Security**

This Web site takes every precaution to protect our members' information. When a member submits sensitive information to Affinity Plus' Web site, their information is protected both on-line and off-line.

When our forms ask members to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number or social security number), that information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry – SSL (Secure Sockets Layer). While on a secure page, such as our Access Plus On-Line Banking page, the lock icon (typically a picture of a key or padlock) on the bottom of Web browsers (such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer) becomes locked. When you are ‘surfing' on a page that isn't secure, the lock icon is unlocked, open or not visible.

While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information on-line, we also do everything in our power to protect member information offline. All of our members' information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. We have procedures that limit employee access to personally identifiable information to those employees with a business reason to know such information about you. We educate our employees about the importance of confidentiality and member privacy through standard operating procedures, special training programs and our policies on ethics. We take appropriate disciplinary measures to enforce employee privacy responsibilities.

**Notifications**

Affinity Plus' Web site is continually improving and adding new functionality and features to this Web site and improving and adding to its existing products, services and programs. Because of these ongoing changes, Affinity Plus' Web site data practices will change from time to time. If we change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on our Web site so our members are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.
