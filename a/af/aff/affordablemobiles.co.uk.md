Affordable Mobiles know that you care about how the information you provide us is used and shared, and we understand and appreciate the level of trust you instill in us when you provide such delicate information. This notice describes our privacy policy.   


By visiting www.affordablemobiles.co.uk you are accepting and consenting to the practices described in this Privacy Notice.  


All information provided to or gathered by affordablemobiles.co.uk is controlled primarily by Affordable Mobiles, Logistics House, Sopwith Way, Drayton Fields Industrial Estate, Daventry, Northamptonshire, NN11 8PB.  


The information we learn from customers helps us to personalise and continually improve your shopping experience with us. We use the information to handle orders, deliver products and services, process payments, communicate with you about orders, products, services and promotional offers, update our records and generally maintain your accounts with us. We also use this information to improve our store and platform, prevent or detect fraud or abuses of our website and enable third parties to carry out technical, logistical or other functions on our behalf.

The information that is gathered from you allows us to process your orders, which in some cases will include the need for credit checks by us and other third party companies, to obtain a mobile airtime agreement. This information is then used by Affordable Mobiles and other third party companies to supply you with the products and services you have ordered. To assist us and the service providers to make a decision on your order, we may use our own records or the files of separate third party credit reference agencies.

From time to time we, our agents, sub-contractors or selected third party companies may contact you with reference to new promotions or services, which we believe will be of benefit to you. You may be contacted through various means such as post, e-mail, telephone, sms or any other messaging services. If you do not wish to receive any further information from us in relation to new promotions or services, then please send an e-mail to [privacy@affordablemobiles.co.uk](mailto:privacy@affordablemobiles.co.uk) or write to the Privacy Manager, Affordable Mobiles, Logistics House, Sopwith Way, Drayton Fields Industrial Estate, Daventry, Northamptonshire, NN11 8PB.
