Affinity Soccer, LLC and its affiliated clients, companies and marketing partners (“Affinity”) value your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal information. Affinity provides this privacy statement (“Privacy Statement”) to inform you of how we use, share, update and secure personal information that we collect. This Privacy Statement applies to information Affinity collects through (i) our team, club, league, event and tournament registration service (“Registration Services), (ii) our association and governing body operating platform (“ShareView Association Platform”), and (iii) services or products offered by Affinity through websites, mobile applications social media, etc. (“Affinity Advantage”). Collectively, the Registration Services, Shareview Association Services and Affinity Advantage Services may be referred to as the “Services”. This Privacy Statement does not create a contractual obligation between you and Affinity and it is subject to our Terms of Use. If you have questions about this Privacy Statement email us at [privacy@affinitysoccer.com](mailto:privacy@affinitysoccer.com) or call us at (800) 808-7195.

**What information does Affinity collect from me?**

From time to time, we receive information related to you or family members that you or a third party voluntarily provides while using one or more of our Services. When registering a participant or volunteer for a team, club, league, event or tournament through our Registration Services, you may provide us with certain personal information which may include your user name, password, address, zip/postal code, email address, phone numbers, participant name, birthdate, emergency contact information, driver’s license number, social security number, and payment information such as credit card or financial account numbers if applicable. We also collect information about you through your use of our ShareView Association Platform or any products or services you purchase or participate in through our Affinity Advantage Services. Affinity may also collect certain automated information through cookies, web beacons, tags, scripts and other automated devices to collect information including personally identifiable information about you when you use our Services which may include internet protocol addresses, operating systems, device specific browser information, location based geographic information, user ID’s and pages viewed through our Services. Affinity may collect certain basic personal information if you connect to any of the Services through social media. Affinity also collects general information about its users which does not necessarily identify the user. Affinity may enable third parties to collect information in connection with our Services. This Privacy Statement does not apply to, and Affinity is not responsible for any collection of information by any third party.

**How does Affinity use my information?**

Affinity does not sell, rent or trade your personal information to third parties. Affinity’s use of your information is consistent with this Privacy Statement.

We use the information that we gather about you (i) to communicate the Services to you, to provide the Services to you and to provide customer service. Affinity’s primary goal in collecting personal information is to provide you, the user, with a customized experience while using any of our Services. This includes personalization services, interactive communications, online commerce, and many other types of services. By knowing a little about our clients and their members, volunteers and users, Affinity is able to deliver better service and more relevant content to each user of one or more of our Services. Once you register for the ShareView Operating Platform, you are no longer anonymous to Affinity as you are provided with a personal user ID and password that provides you with access to the areas of our client’s operating platform so that you can view data or perform role based functions that our client has given you permission to access.  With certain Services, we collect information about you on behalf of our sports association clients where our contracts significantly limit our ability to use your information. In many cases, our right to use your information is solely to provide the Services and many of our written client agreements do not allow Affinity to use your information for marketing purposes without the prior written approval of our clients. Affinity may combine certain personal information, customer information and automated information both online and from third parties and we may share such information with affiliates, partners and subsidiaries. Affinity will retain such information as needed in order to provide the Services, comply with legal obligations, resolve disputes and enforce agreements.

**How Can I Access and Update My Personal Information?**

For the ShareView Association Platform Service, you can log in to your account, provide your password and then update any of your personal contact information that is listed within your personal account information.

**What about Affinity’s clients, partner services or linked sites?**

Several of our clients request that we establish links to third party organizations, products and services.  To obtain some of these other products and services you may be on another company’s web site or a site they share with Affinity. When ordering, registering for, or purchasing products or services from these partners or you click on a link away from Affinity’s website, you will be entering into an agreement with that partner, and not with Affinity. In these cases, Affinity’s privacy policy would not apply, but the privacy policy of the partner who provides the goods or services would then apply to your information. We urge you to read and understand each third party’s privacy policies and terms of use prior to using their product or service. While Affinity is committed to trying to partner with third parties that share our privacy concerns, Affinity can’t control the way these partners collect or use your information. If you have questions about any third party’s privacy policies, please contact them directly.

**How Secure Is My Information?**

Affinity has implemented a variety of reasonable security measures including password protection, encryption and secure socket layers to help protect your information from loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, modification or destruction. We also use a variety of security measures to help protect your information that we store by implementing a number of physical, administrative and technical controls. Please be aware that despite our reasonable efforts, no data security measures can guarantee security of your data at all times so keep this in mind when disclosing personal information through the Internet. It is important that you never divulge your password to anyone. Also please remember to sign out of your account and close your browser window from any of your internet enabled devices when you have finished use of a connection to any of our Services.

**What Choices Do I Have Regarding My Information?**

You may unsubscribe from future e-mail marketing communications from Affinity by clicking on the unsubscribe link provided in our email communications. Please note that it may take up to ten (10) business days for Affinity to process your opt-out request. Even if you opt-out of future e-mail marketing communications, Affinity many still contact you as part of our customer service responsibilities related to the Services. In addition, you may still receive emails sent by our clients through means other than Affinity’s email service.

**SECURITY**

At Affinity, we appreciate your concerns about the security of your confidential online business transactions. Affinity takes security measures to protect information passed between our site and your computer.  Affinity strives to provide a private and secure Web environment to all users of the Website and its services. Password, credit card and other personal information is encrypted before being stored on Affinity’s servers.

Affinity’s hosting service uses Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology, which provides strong encryption to digital information as it crosses the Internet and supports up to 256-bit encryption, depending on your browser’s capabilities. Affinity maintains high performance as well as highly reliable access to data regardless of a user’s physical location. Affinity’s physical hardware and software components of its IT infrastructure are further hardened against attack and natural disasters. Affinity’s systems are co-located at an enterprise quality service provider with all of the resources required to support large-scale applications.

Affinity’s data center is guarded and under video surveillance on a 24/7 basis to ensure maximum access control and data protection. Affinity stores files under the desired security permissions rules specified by the Website administrator and tracks all versions and usage of files by those users who are granted access.

Affinity uses a highly secure technique based on S/MIME, which utilizes public key cryptography to digitally sign and encrypt each message sent for player and volunteer registrations using Affinity’s online registration service. This protects not only against the message being read, but also is designed to show that the message came only from the sender and was not altered in transport. From the moment you submit an online registration to the moment you leave our registration service website, all data transferred between your browser and Affinity’s servers is encrypted. This means that your credit card numbers and order details are always encrypted as they are passed across the Internet. This combination of encrypted online sessions and a highly secure computing infrastructure serves to help protect your information and the storage of your information..

**Children Under The Age of 13.**

A parent has the right to consent to the collection and use of personal information regarding their children who are under the age of 13 (individually, a “Child”, collectively, “Children”) solely to provide the Services without also consenting to the disclosure of such information to third parties. Affinity does not knowingly collect personal information from a Child without express parental consent. Affinity does not share personal information collected from Children with third parties for any purpose other than to provide the Services. On behalf of our association clients, in order to register Children to participate on a team, league, tournament or event, Affinity may collect the following information from Children under the age of 13; date of birth, display name, information about activities or interests, gender, photo submitted by parent or guardian, height, weight, uniform size, position, all-star participation, awards, red cards, injuries and return to play data. Affinity maintains the information we collect for as long as your Child’s account is active and Affinity uses this information solely to provide the Services. If you are a parent or guardian who believes that Affinity has unauthorized information about your Child or wants to delete information related to your Child, then please email us at privacy@affinitysports.com or call us at (800) 808-7195.
