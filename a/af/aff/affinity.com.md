**Information We Collect**  
Our purpose in collecting information from you is to help us provide you with better service, such as notifications about special offers and promotions. We will not willfully disclose any personally identifiable information about you to any third party without first receiving your permission, as explained in this Privacy Statement.

If you are applying for an account with Affinity.com, we may require that you provide us with certain personal information (such as name, email address, billing information, etc.) relevant to our provision of the various services offered on the Site. We do not collect any personal information other than that which is specifically and knowingly provided to us by you. When we request information, we shall explain how it may be used and give you an opportunity to request that the information not be used for those purposes.

**Third Party Cookies**  
Affinity.com may, at times, drop third party web beacons. Opting out of third parties' services will prevent them from collecting data when a user visits any of Affinity.com's partner/customer sites. By doing so, advertisements will no longer be tailored to your interests.
