# Privacy Policy | Affinnova

Last Updated: April, 2011

This privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") discloses the information that Affinnova, Inc. ("Affinnova") gathers on www.affinnova.com (the "Site"), as well as ways in which Affinnova processes and sometimes shares such information.

Except where otherwise expressly indicated in this Privacy Policy or on the Site, this Privacy Policy applies only to information collected on the Site and does not apply to information collected outside of the Site. Before using or submitting information to the Site, please review this Privacy Policy carefully.

Certain areas of the Site contain information, content or services intended only for users who register to use those areas of the Site ("Registered Users"), and Affinnova reserves the right to limit those areas to Registered Users. This Privacy Policy addresses Affinnova's privacy practices relating to general use of the Site, as well as use of the Site by Registered Users.

**A. Information Affinnova Collects**

Affinnova collects the following types of information from users of the Site:

**1\. Personally Identifiable Information**

Affinnova may receive and store any information that you enter on the Site or provide to Affinnova in any other way on or through the Site that would allow Affinnova to identify you or contact you (collectively "Personally Identifiable Information"). The Personally Identifiable Information that you provide will be used by Affinnova only in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Examples of Personally Identifiable Information Affinnova may collect from you are:

  * your name, e-mail address, telephone number, employer's industry, name and address and your job title if you are a Registered User or are otherwise asked to provide such information, such as information you provide in connection with your request to view a demonstration of our products and services;
  * the names and e-mail addresses of those who communicate with Affinnova by e-mail;
  * email addresses of any person that you provide in connection with your use of certain features of the Site; and
  * information you provide about yourself when you apply for employment via the Site.



You may choose not to provide Affinnova with certain Personally Identifiable Information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of certain features of the Site.

**2\. Automatic Information**

Affinnova may receive and store certain types of technical information whenever you interact with Affinnova through the Site. We may automatically receive and record your browser information, operating system information, IP address, the page you requested and the page the directed you to the Site. This allows Affinnova to enhance your experience and better support your needs. This information is not stored in a manner that is personally identifiable with you and may include the following:

_(a) Aggregate Information_

In connection with your visit to the Site, Affinnova may automatically collect usage information, such as the numbers of users and frequency of use. With respect to the Concept Studio Service, Affinnova may automatically collect certain statistical information including your last sign-on, number of concepts, number of dynamic elements, number of image objects, number of text objects per concept and word count. This data is only used in the aggregate as a statistical measure and not in a manner that would identify you personally. Aggregate information generally is collected through the use of cookies as discussed below.

_(b) Cookies_

Affinnova uses "cookies" to help you access and navigate the Site more efficiently and to statistically monitor how many people are using the Site. A "cookie" is a small file or tool stored on your hard drive containing information that allows Affinnova to deliver customized information to you. If you become a Registered User, Affinnova may use cookies to store your e-mail address, password and other technical information related to the Site so that Affinnova can identify you when you return to the Site, track your use of the Site and customize the Site for you. You may set your browser to notify you of or decline the receipt of cookies. Certain features of the Site may not, however, function properly or be available if your browser is configured to disable cookies.

Affinnova uses both "session" and "persistent" cookies on the Site. Session cookies are temporary bits of information that are erased once you exit your web browser or turn off your computer. Persistent cookies are more permanent bits of information that are placed on the hard drive of your computer and stay there unless you delete the cookie. Persistent cookies store information on your computer for a number of reasons, such as retrieving certain information you have previously provided (i.e., email address and password) and helping to determine what areas of the Site you find most valuable. Many companies offer programs that help you to visit web sites anonymously and Affinnova wants you to be aware that these programs are available, but use of such programs may block your access to certain features of the Site.

_(c) E-mail Communications_

When you send an e-mail to Affinnova, either through the "Contact" tab on the Site or otherwise, Affinnova may retain your e-mail address and the contents of the e-mail that you send. This Privacy Policy does not apply to content, business information, ideas, concepts or inventions that you send to Affinnova by e-mail. Please refer to Affinnova's [Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/terms-of-use/ "Terms of Use") for Affinnova's policy with respect to such information. If you want to keep the information in your email(s) private or proprietary, please do not send such information in an e-mail to Affinnova.

**3\. Third Party Links**

The Site may contain links to third-party websites. Please be aware that Affinnova cannot control and is not responsible for the information collection practices of such websites, which may differ from those of Affinnova. Affinnova encourages you to review and understand the privacy policies of these websites before providing any information to them.

**4\. Data Security**

Affinnova maintains a variety of commercially reasonable physical, electronic and procedural safeguards designed to protect your Personally Identifiable Information from unauthorized access and disclosure. For example, Affinnova uses accepted tools and techniques to protect against unauthorized access to Affinnova's systems. You should be aware that Affinnova has no control over the security of other websites on the Internet that you might visit or with which you might interact even when a link may appear to another site from the Site. Although Affinnova takes steps to secure your information, Affinnova does not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information, searches or other communications will always remain secure. In the event of a breach of the confidentiality or security of your information, including your Personally Identifiable Information, Affinnova will notify you as necessary and if possible so you can take appropriate protective steps. Affinnova may notify you under such circumstances using the e-mail address(es) that Affinnova has on record for you and/or by regular mail (if available).

**5\. Children**

The Site is a general audience site and is not intended for children under 13. Affinnova requires that only persons 13 years of age or older use the Site. By using the Site, you hereby represent that you are at least 13 years old. Affinnova does not knowingly market to, solicit information, accept service or collect information from children under the age of 13. When the Site has actual knowledge that it collects information from children or offers a service directed toward children, it will comply with applicable laws, including the U.S. Children's Online Privacy Protection Act.

**6\. Changes to this Privacy Policy**

At any time without prior notice, Affinnova may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in Affinnova's practices.

If Affinnova makes any material change to this Privacy Policy, Affinnova will notify each Registered User by sending an e-mail to the e-mail address provided to Affinnova in a Registered User's account, profile and/or registration and/or by prominently posting notice of the changes on the Site.

Any changes to Affinnova's Privacy Policy will become effective upon Affinnova's posting of the updated policy.

**7\. California Privacy Rights Under California Civil Code Section 1798.83**

If you are a resident of California ("California Users"), in addition to the rights set forth in this Privacy Policy, you generally have the right to request information from Affinnova regarding the manner in which Affinnova shares certain categories of Personally Identifiable Information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes.

Under the law, however, a business is not required to provide this information if it adopts and discloses to the public (in its privacy policy) a policy of not disclosing customer's personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes unless the customer first affirmatively agrees to the disclosure, as long as the business maintains and discloses this policy. Rather, the business may comply with the law by notifying California Users of their rights to prevent disclosure of personal information and providing a cost free means to exercise that right. As stated above, Affinnova does not share such Personally Identifiable Information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes unless you have requested Affinnova to do so or have otherwise consented and then subject to your right to opt-out of sharing your personal information for third party marketing purposes.

Please note that whenever you opt in to receive future communications from a third party, your information will be subject to the third party's privacy policy. If you later decide that you do not want that third party to use your information, you will need to contact the third party directly, as Affinnova has no control over how third parties use information. You should always review the privacy policy of any party that collects your information to determine how it will handle your information.

Please note that Affinnova is only required to respond to one request per user per year. Affinnova is not required to respond to requests made by means other than through [info@affinnova.com](mailto:info@affinnova.com "info@affinnova.com").
