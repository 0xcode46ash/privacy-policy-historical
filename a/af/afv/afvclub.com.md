# Armed Forces Vacation Club

  
We at the **Armed Forces Vacation Club and Resort Condominiums International, LLC, (AFVC and RCI)** and the family of companies owned by Cendant Corporation, Our parent company (collectively referred to as **AFVC** ," "We," "Us," or "Our") recognize the importance of protecting the privacy of certain information or data collected about Our users, prospective users or other customers (collectively referred to as "Users," "You," or "Your"). This Privacy Policy discloses what information We gather, how We use it, and how to correct or change it. At **AFVC,** it is Our intention to give You an understanding about how We collect Your information and the use We make of it in the course of Our business. 

  
**How does AFVC collect information?**

  
**We** gather two (2) types of information about our Users: 1) data that users provide through optional, voluntary registration on Our Web Sites; and 2) data **We** gather through aggregated tracking, mainly by tallying Web page views throughout Our Web Sites. Such information enables Us to tailor Our content to fit Our Users' needs better and to help Our advertisers understand Our audience. However, be assured that **We** will not disclose information gathered by U **s** from Your use of Our Web Sites to third parties without Your consent, except as may be noted in this Privacy Policy or disclosed to You when the information is submitted. 

**We** also collect general business information relating to employees, contractors, shareholders, resort managers and other individuals. However, this privacy policy does not outline in detail the use of contractor and employee information.

  
_Optional registration_

  
We collect information by specifically requesting it from You. Generally this occurs when You register at one of Our Web Sites or request information or a service. Usually, the **AFVC & RCI** Web Sites and **Our** service partners use Your information to operate the Web Sites and to deliver services. **Our** Web Sites also use Your information to inform You about other products or services available from **RCI** and its affiliates. 

_Usage tracking_

  
_Use of Internet Protocol ("IP") Addresses_. An IP address is a unique number that is automatically assigned to Your computer whenever you're surfing the Internet so that Your computer can be identified by the main computers, known as "Web servers," that "serve up" Web pages. 

  
**RCI** and/or its affiliates collect IP addresses for the purposes of system administration, to report aggregated information to Our advertisers, and to audit the use of Our Web Site. When users request pages from **RCI** and/or its affiliates' Web Sites, Our servers log the users IP addresses. We do not normally link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable, which means that a users session will be logged, but the User will remain anonymous to Us. We can and will use IP addresses to identify a User when We feel it is necessary to enforce compliance with Our site terms of use or terms of service or to protect Our service, site, other members or others. 

  
_Use Of Cookies_. What are cookies? Cookies are small pieces of information that a Web site sends to Your computer for record-keeping purposes, which information is stored in a file on Your computer. Cookies make Web-surfing easier for You by saving Your preferences so that We can use the saved information to facilitate Your use of Our Web site when You return to the site. Cookies do not tell Us Your individual identity unless You have chosen to provide it to Us, nor does Your accepting a cookie in any way gives Us access to Your computer. We never save passwords or credit card information in cookies. The use of cookies is an industry standard, and as such, You'll find that most major Web sites use them. 

  
By showing how and when users use a site, cookies help Us see which areas are popular and which are not. Many improvements and updates to the site are based on such data as total number of visitors and pages viewed. This information is most easily tracked with cookies. We use the information from cookies to provide services better tailored to Our Users' needs. 

  
Most cookies expire after a defined period of time, or You can delete Your cookie file at any time. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. You can reset Your browser to refuse all cookies or indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, note that some parts of **RCI** and/or its affiliates' services will not function properly or may be considerably slower if You refuse cookies. For example, without cookies, You will not be able to set personalized preferences, and/or may have difficulty completing marketing transactions. 

**RCI** and/or its affiliates have two (2) primary uses for its cookies. First, We use them to specify a user's preferences. For example, users can specify keywords across several categories or markets so You don't have to tell Us repeatedly about Your travel preferences. Second, We use cookies to track users Web site usage trends and patterns. This helps Us understand Our users needs better and improve areas of **RCI's** and/or its affiliates' services that Our Users find valuable. While both of these activities depend on the use of cookies, You have the option of disabling the cookies via Your browser preferences. 

  
You may occasionally get cookies from Our advertisers. **RCI** and/or its affiliates do not control these cookies. The use of advertising cookies sent by third-party servers is standard in the Internet industry. 

**What Personal Information does RCI/AFVC collect?**

  
**RCI/AFVC** only collects Personal Information that is necessary for business purposes. _“Personal Information” means information about an identifiable individual, and includes names, telephone numbers, addresses, e-mail address, credit card numbers and related transactional information and other Personal Information You may provide to us by any means, including but not limited to through Our Web-sites and through third parties, by e-mail, telephone, fax or mail._ _  Personal Information does not include the name, title or business address or telephone number of an employee of an organization, or the name, address or telephone number of a person that is available in a public telephone directory_. As a general rule, **RCI** does not, and will not do the following with Your Personal Information:  (1) sell Your Personal Information to anyone; (2) use the _Personal_ Information We collect and store to make decisions about granting or extending consumer credit unless You submit a separate credit application and authorize Us to use or disclose this information; or (3) act as a consumer reporting agency, or furnish information about any User's credit worthiness, credit standing, credit capacity, character, general reputation, personal characteristics or mode of living to any consumer reporting agency.

We will only use and disclose Your Personal Information that You submit to Us with others as stated in this **RCI/AFVC** Privacy Policy. **RCI** collects Personal Information in many parts of its business. These include: 

  * **_RCI_** _Exchange and **RCI** Points_: **RCI** collects Personal Information about members at the time when a person first joins a program and while a person is a member. The main categories of information we collect relate to a person's general contact information, personal details such as age range and gender, use of the program, payment details, responses to surveys and other details, which are usually collected directly from the member. 
  * _RCI Resort Management_ : In its role of managing resorts, **RCI** collects Personal Information related to bookings and as necessary for other purposes related to the management of the resort facility. Further Personal Information may be collected in specific instances such as in the event of an incident occurring at the resort being managed for legal and insurance reasons. 
  * _RCI Travel_ : **RCI** collects Personal Information on individuals when they book their travel arrangements, in order to process the transaction and to fulfill booking requests with travel and tourism operators. 



**With whom does RCI disclose and use Your Personal Information?**

  
Our purpose in collecting information about You is to provide You with membership services, such as exchanging Your vacation accommodation entitlements. **RCI** uses Personal Information in several different ways in operating Our membership programs and operating Our business, and most of these uses are clear from the circumstances. We also use Your Personal Information for internal quality assurance purposes. The following describes some of the ways that Your Personal Information may be used or disclosed. 

_Business Partners & Sponsors_: **RCI** provides Personal Information to resort operators in order to facilitate a booking that You have requested or to generate leads to timeshare developers in connection with their offers to sell timeshares to You. Otherwise **RCI** does not routinely disclose Personal Information, _except_ where it is necessary to provide you with a service that You have requested such as (1) to make bookings for your travel with airlines or (2) to respond to Your inquiry for further information about mini-vacations at resorts (which are offered by timeshare developers), where a tour of the resorts is either required or requested of You by the timeshare developers. **RCI** may also disclose some or all of Your Personal Information to business partners or sponsors [but this use will be specifically described to You prior to data collection or prior to transferring the data]. Many promotions offer opportunities to request additional information from sponsors. By requesting more information, You give **RCI** permission to transfer Your Personal Information to the sponsor so they can fulfill Your request. 

  
_Third Party & Aggregate Data_: From time to time, You may be offered the opportunity to receive materials or special offers from third parties. If You opt to receive information from these third parties, **RCI** will share Your name, e-mail address and other Personal Information with such third parties. Under confidentiality agreements, **RCI** may match Personal Information with third party data. Also, **RCI** may keep track of what portions of the Web site users are visiting and other user statistics, and aggregate this information to help Us create a better experience for users of Our Web site. This is done in order to describe Our viewers and services to prospective partners, advertisers, and other third parties, and for other lawful purposes. 

  
_Other_ : **RCI** may also disclose account information in special cases when We have reason to believe that disclosing this Personal Information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be violating **RCI's** terms of use or terms of service, or may be causing injury to or interference (either intentionally or unintentionally) with any of **RCI's** rights or property, other **RCI** users, or anyone else **RCI** may disclose or access account information when We believe in good faith that the law requires it and for administrative and other purposes that We deem necessary, in Our sole discretion, to maintain, service, and improve Our products and services. 

  
**How can You control the usage of Your Personal Information?**

  
In case You change Your mind or some Personal Information is out of date, is inaccurate, or otherwise changes (such as Your zip code or e-mail address), We will try to provide a way to correct, update, or remove such Personal Information that You give Us. We also give You the opportunity to control the communications We direct to You. We offer Users the opportunity to "opt out" of having Personal Information shared with parties outside **RCI** and/or its affiliated companies. If a User wishes to update Personal Information or objects to any usage provided herein for any reason, he/she may e-mail the requested change to:  [feedback@afvclub.com](mailto:feedback@afvclub.com).

**What happens when You link to a third party Web site?**

  
You should be aware that when You are on **AFVC’s** Web Sites You could hyperlink or be directed to other Web sites that are beyond Our control and/or outside Our service. For example, if You "click" on a banner advertisement or a **AFVC** search result, the "click" may transfer You off the **AFVC** Web Sites. These other Web sites may include Web sites of advertisers, timeshare developers, resort operators, sponsors and partners that may use **AFVC’s** and/or its affiliates' logo as part of a co-branding agreement. These other Web sites may send their own cookies to users and members, collect data, or solicit personal information. 

  
**RCI** does not control such Web sites, and, therefore, is not responsible for their contents or the hyperlinks or advertising they choose to place on such Web sites. **RCI's** and/or its affiliates' inclusion of hyperlinks to these Web sites do not imply any endorsement of the material on such Web sites or any association with their owners or operators. **RCI's** policy does not extend to anything that is inherent in the operation of the Internet, which is beyond **RCI's** and its affiliates' control. 

  
Please keep in mind that whenever You give out information online (for example, via message boards or chat) that information can be collected and used by people You don't know. While RCI strives to protect their Users' Personal Information and privacy, We cannot guarantee the security of any information You disclose online, and You disclose such information at Your own risk. 

  
**How We secure Your Personal Information from others using the AFVC Web Sites?**

  
The security of all information associated with Our Users is an important concern to Us. We exercise care in providing secure transmission of Your information from Your computer to Our servers. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while We strive to protect Your Personal Information, **RCI** cannot ensure or warrant the security of any Personal Information You transmit to Us or from Our online products or services, and You do so at Your own risk. Once We receive Your transmission, **RCI** uses industry standard efforts to safeguard the confidentiality of Your Personal Information, such as firewalls and Secure Socket Layers. However, "perfect security" does not exist on the Internet.

  
**YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF THESE TERMS**

  
By using Our Web Sites, You signify Your agreement with **RCI's** Privacy Policy. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH THIS POLICY, PLEASE DO NOT USE OUR WEB SITES. Your continued use of **AFVC/RCI's** and/or its affiliates' Web Sites following the posting of changes to these terms will mean You accept those changes.
