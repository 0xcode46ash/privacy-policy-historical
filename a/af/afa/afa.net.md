## Privacy Statement

American Family Association (AFA) strives to offer its visitors the many advantages of Internet technology and provide a positive interactive experience. We may use Personally Identifiable Information (your name, e-mail address, street address) subject to the terms of this Privacy Policy. **PLEASE NOTE: From time to time, we may share all or parts of our list with a third party. This sharing will be with the third party we feel is acceptable. Any sharing will be rare and selective.**

**By accessing or using AFA-related sites, you agree to the terms of the Privacy Policy, as outlined below. If you do not agree to these terms, please do not access or use the site. AFA reserves the right to change the Privacy Policy from time to time at its sole discretion. Your use of this site will be subject to the current version of the Privacy Policy at the time of such use.**

**How we gather information from users**  
How we collect and store information depends on the site you are visiting, the activities in which you elect to participate and the services provided. For example, you may be asked to provide information when you register for access to certain portions of one of our sites or request certain features, such as newsletters, news updates, or when you purchase one of our products. You may provide information when you participate in voting and polling activities, online activism or advocacy efforts, and other interactive areas of our site.

Like most web sites, AFA-related sites also collect information automatically and through the use of electronic tools that may be transparent to our visitors. For example, we may use cookie technology to recognize you and hold information from your visit. Among other things, the cookie may store your user name and e-mail address, sparing you from having to re-enter that information each time you visit.

**What we do with the information we collect**  
Aggregated Information (information that does not personally identify you) may be used in many ways. For example, we may combine information about your usage patterns with similar information obtained from other users to help enhance our site and services (e.g., to learn which pages are visited most or what features are most attractive).

**AFA recognizes and appreciates the importance of responsible use of information collected on this site. For this reason, AFA reserves the option of contacting you from time to time about important issues in which the American Family Association is involved. In each communication you receive from us, you are given the opportunity to opt-out by using an unsubscribe function provided at the end of each message.**

**Children**  
AFA does not knowingly collect or solicit Personally Identifiable Information from or about children under 13 except as permitted by law. If we discover we have received any information from a child under 13 in violation of this policy, we will delete that information immediately. If you believe AFA has any information from or about anyone under 13, please contact us at the address listed below.
