# AFAR - Where travel can take you

On Afar.com, we want to provide you with information that is tailored to your individual needs and, at the same time, help you protect your privacy. This notice explains our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your personal information is collected and used.

This privacy policy extends to both the Afar.com website and the other Afar Media products, such as Afar magazine subscriptions, that you can purchase or access through the site. Please read this notice very carefully.

## The Types of Information We Collect

From time to time at this site, you may be able to participate in our online community, post text or other media, order products, enter contests, vote in polls, or subscribe to one of our services. When you do any of these things, we may ask you for personally identifiable information such as your name, address, email address, telephone number, fax number, credit card information (if you are purchasing something from us), and information about your interests in and use of various products, programs, and services.

You may also occasionally submit information about other people. For example, you might submit a person's name and email address to invite him or her to join the Afar.com service or order a gift subscription online. If you want the subscription sent directly to the recipient, you may submit the recipient's name, address, and telephone number.

Like most website operators, Afar collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. 

Afar also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, which is usually associated with the place from which you access the Internet, like your Internet service provider, your company, or your university. Afar does not use such information to identify its visitors, however, and does not disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information, as described below. 

Registered users of the Afar.com website choose to interact with Afar in ways that require Afar to gather additional personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Afar gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for the Afar.com service to provide a username and email address. Those who engage in transactions with Afar are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, Afar collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with Afar. Afar does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And users can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities. 

Afar does not collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13. If you believe that a child has provided Afar with personally identifiable information without the consent of his or her parent or guardian, please contact us at support@afar.com. If Afar becomes aware that a child under age 13 has provided us with personally identifiable information, we will delete such information. 

As a registered user of Afar.com, you may also provide us information in the content you post to Afar.com. Your questions, answers, photos, and other contributions on Afar.com, and metadata about them (such as when you posted them), are publicly viewable on Afar.com, along with your name. Some of this information may be searched by search engines and be republished elsewhere on the Web in accordance with our Terms of Service.

## How We Use the Information

We will use information you provide about yourself to fulfill your requests for products, programs, and services, to respond to your inquiries about offerings, and to offer you other products, programs or services that we believe may be of interest to you. We sometimes use this information to communicate with you, such as to notify you when you have won one of our contests or when we make changes to subscriber agreements, to fulfill a request by you, or to contact you about your account with us. 

We use the information that you provide about others to enable us to invite them to join Afar.com. From time to time, we also may use this information to offer products, programs, or services to them.

If you submit content for publication (for example, a letter to our editors), we may publish your name and other information you have provided to us. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users, readers, or customers. 

You should also be aware that if you submit information to “chat rooms,” “forums” or “message boards” such information becomes public information, meaning that you lose any privacy rights you might have with regards to that information. Such disclosures may also increase your chances of receiving unwanted communications.

We sometimes may use non-personally identifiable information that we collect to improve the design and content of our site and to enable us to personalize your experience. We also may use this information in the aggregate to analyze site usage, as well as to offer products, programs, or services. We may use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, gather broad demographic information, and administer our website.

We do not rent or sell our users' email addresses. However, unless you request otherwise, we may rent or share your name and address with carefully selected companies who we believe can offer you services and products of interest to you. If you do not wish to have your information shared, write to us at privacy@afar.com. If you do not wish to receive online marketing communications or our newsletter from us, write to us at privacy@afar.com or simply follow the unsubscribe instructions contained within the email. We will not use or transfer personally identifiable information provided to us in ways unrelated to the ones described above without also providing you with an opportunity to opt out of these unrelated uses. 

We allow access to our database by third parties that provide us with services such as technical maintenance, but only for the purpose of providing those services. If you choose to purchase items through our site, we may forward your information to third parties for services such as credit card processing and order fulfillment. There also may be times when you provide information about yourself to us in areas of the site that are managed or participated in by third parties, such as featured merchant partners. In such cases, the information may be used by us and by such third parties, each pursuant to its own policies. We may also provide your information to our advertisers, so that they can serve ads to you that meet your needs or match your interests. While we will seek to require such third parties to follow appropriate privacy policies and will not authorize them to use this information except for the express purpose for which it is provided, Afar Media LLC. does not bear any responsibility for any actions or policies of third parties. We encourage you to read such privacy policies of any third-party sites you visit. 

Some of those third parties may be located outside of your home country; by using the Website, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. In addition, in some cases we may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions, user information is typically one of the business assets that is transferred. Moreover, if Afar or substantially all of its assets were acquired, or in the unlikely event that Afar goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquiror of Afar may continue to use your personal and non-personal information only as set forth in this policy. 

Other than as described in this privacy policy, Afar discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only when required to do so by law, or when Afar believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Afar, third parties or the public at large. 

For users outside the United States, please note that any personally-identifiable information you enter into the Website will be transferred out of your country and into the United States. You consent to such transfer through your use of the Website. You also warrant that you have the right to transfer such information outside your country and into the United States. 

Although we take appropriate measures to safeguard against unauthorized disclosures of information, we cannot assure you that personally identifiable information that we collect will never be disclosed in a manner that is inconsistent with this Privacy Notice. Inadvertent disclosures may result, for example, when third parties misrepresent their identities in asking the site for access to personally identifiable information about themselves for purposes of correcting possible factual errors in the data.

Afar visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using the Afar Website, with the drawback that certain features of Afar’s Website may not function properly without the aid of cookies. 

## Privacy Policy Changes

Although most changes are likely to be minor, Afar may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in Afar’s sole discretion. If we do then we’ll notify you by posting the amended policy on the website or by emailing you of the nature of the modifications along with a link to the modified document so that you can review it.
