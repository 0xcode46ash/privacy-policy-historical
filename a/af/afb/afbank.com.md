If you decide to close your account(s) or become an inactive customer, we will continue to adhere to the terms of this Privacy Policy.

We may disclose all of the information we collect, as described above, to companies that provide us with products or services that help us furnish banking services to you (for example, check printers, appraisers, loan processors, etc.).

7\. CONFIDENTIALITY AND SECURITY  
We maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that comply with Federal regulations to guard your personal and financial information. Our employees do not have access to your personal or financial information unless they have a business reason to have access to this information. We educate our employees on the importance of maintaining the confidentiality of your personal and financial information and on this Privacy Policy.

9\. PRIVACY INFORMATION SPECIFIC TO INTERNET USAGE

  1. When you visit our web site (www.afbank.com), we want to assure you that we adhere to this Privacy Policy. 
  2. We collect and store information about "hits" on our web site for internal review purposes only. Such information may include the name of the domain from which you access the Internet (such as Compuserve.com or att.net), the date and time you access our site, and the Internet address of the web site from which you linked to us. This information enables us to see how you use our web site and keep our web site user-friendly. 
  3. Our web site does not require you disclose any personally identifying information. However, if you do provide personal information, such as your mailing and e-mail address, telephone and fax numbers, or demographic and customer identification, we will not disclose (share, sell, or divulge) it except: 
    * In order to complete a transaction initiated by you 
    * At your request 
    * In response to legal process (for example, a subpoena that complies with applicable right to financial privacy laws) 
    * To persons who provide us with products or services that help us furnish banking services to you (for example, check printers, appraisers, loan processors, etc.)

The cookie cannot be read by a web site other than the one that set the cookie. We use cookies for a number of administrative purposes, for example, to store preferences for certain kinds of information or to store a password so that it does not have to be input for every visit someone makes to our site. Most cookies last only through a single session, or visit. None will contain information that will enable anyone to contact the visitor via telephone or e-mail. In addition, web browsers can be set to inform the visitor when cookies are set or to prevent cookies from being set. 
  5. We do not knowingly solicit information from children and we do not market specifically to children. We recognize that protecting children's identities and privacy online is important and that the responsibility to do so rests with parents and the online industry.
