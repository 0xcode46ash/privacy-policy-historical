# Privacy Policy - Africa Freak

Your privacy is very important to us. This privacy policy explains how the information you share with us is used.

### KIND OF INFORMATION WE COLLECT

If you choose to register on our site, we ask you for information such as name, e-mail address, postal address, age, gender, and telephone number. We may track certain information about you based upon your behavior on our site. We use this information to do internal research on our users’ demographics, interests, and behavior to better understand, protect and serve our users. This information is compiled and analyzed on an aggregated basis.

### USE OF YOUR INFORMATION

We use the information we receive about you in connection with the services and features we provide to you and other users like your friends, the advertisers that purchase ads on the site, and the developers who build the games, applications, and websites you use.

• We don’t share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop our services, or protect our rights.  
• We don’t store personal information on our servers unless required for the on-going operation of our services.  
• We aim to make it as simple as possible for you to control what’s visible to the public, seen by search engines, kept private.

We may use the information we receive about you:

• as part of our efforts to keep our Site safe and secure;  
• to provide you with location features and services, like telling you and your friends when something is going on nearby;  
• to measure or understand the effectiveness of ads you and others see;  
• to make suggestions to you and other users on our Site.

Granting us this permission not only allows us to provide AfricaFreak.com as it exists today, but it also allows us to provide you with innovative features and services we develop in the future that use the information we receive about you in new ways.

While you are allowing us to use the information we receive about you, you always own all of your information. Your trust is important to us, which is why we don’t share information we receive about you with others unless we have:

• received your permission;  
• given you notice, such as by telling you about it in this policy; or  
• removed your name or any other personally identifying information from it.

### THIRD PARTY LINKS

The service may contain links to third party websites that are not owned or controlled by us.

In addition, we will not and cannot censor or edit the content of any third-party site. By using the service, you expressly relieve AfricaFreak.com from any and all liability arising from your use of any third-party website.

Accordingly, we encourage you to be aware when you leave the service and to read the terms and conditions and privacy policy of each other website that you visit.

### USE OF COOKIES
