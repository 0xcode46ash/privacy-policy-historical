# AAT Website Privacy policy

The AAT carries a firm commitment to the privacy of your personal data.

 **This privacy policy describes:**

The information we collect through this website (www.aat.org.uk)  
What we do with it  
Who we share parts of it with

 **The information we collect and how we use it**

We believe it is highly important to respect the privacy of all visitors and to make only safe and ethical use of the information provided to the website. We aim to give you as much control as possible over the information you do give, and in all cases the disclosure of your personal details is voluntary.

Where we ask for information we do so in order to offer you better services, both on the website and in the rest of our operations.  
If you believe that any information we hold about you is inaccurate, please notify us, and we will do our best to correct it as quickly as possible.

Some of the information you give will be held in databases: we will ensure that these are secure and can only be accessed by authorised people.

We may also ask you to complete surveys or questionnaires on the website from time to time. These will always be voluntary but we may use the information from them to personalise the website and to target marketing to relevant users.

We will ask for your e-mail address if you wish to receive update information and newsletters via e-mail. You can change your e-mail address or choose not to receive further information at any time.

 **Who will have access to the information**

Any information you give will be available to the AAT.

If you choose to add your e-mail address to your membership record, it will not be made available to any third party.  
Information you give in response to surveys and questionnaires on the website will be used in two ways:

By the AAT itself to help determine policy and to help improve its services to members  
By third parties that the Association may make the information available for market research: in this case, the information will be made available only in the form of anonymous statistical reports. 

We may follow up some survey responses by phone or e-mail.

This privacy statement forms part of the AAT's commitment to the principles of the Data Protection Act 1998.
