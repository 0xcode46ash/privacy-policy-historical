AA Ireland Data Protection Privacy Policy  
| 

| 

"AA" means the AA group of companies including AA Ireland Limited and its subsidiary and holding companies. A list of the companies within the AA Group can be obtained from the The Secretary, AA Ireland Ltd, 56 Drury Street, Dublin 2. 

AA (We) are committed to protecting your privacy. We comply with the principles of the Data Protection Acts 1988 and 2003 and aim to maintain consistently high levels of best practice in our processing of personal and/or sensitive personal data.  
  
---  
  
How we use information you provide us   
  
We use the information we receive from you to provide goods and/or services that you request, to communicate with you, and to personalise our information sent to you. We do not sell, trade, or rent your personal information to others.

We store all the information you provide us, including information provided via forms you complete on our website, and information which we may collect from your browsing. Our server, in common with nearly all web servers, logs each page that is downloaded from the site.

Examples of how we may personalise information might include preparing an insurance quote for you.

Third parties may deliver some of our products to you or provide all or part of the service requested by you. In these instances, whilst the information you provide will be disclosed to them, it will only be used for the administration of the service provided (including for example claims processing), underwriting and pricing purposes as appropriate, testing, and to maintain management information for business analysis.

We ask for your home, mobile telephone number, and email address to enable us to contact you in relation to an enquiry you have made, to contact you about relevant products or services which we offer, to contact you if there is a problem with your order, or there is another genuine reason for doing so. If you provide us with credit or debit card details in order to pay for a service or product, we will keep such details secure and ensure that the details are only used further with your consent and/or for the purposes of any appropriate refunds.

When you enter a contest or other promotional feature, we may ask for your name, address, telephone numbers and email address so we can administer the contest and notify winners.

Occasionally, we may also use the information we collect to notify you by post, telephone, mobile telephone, email and/or SMS about new or existing AA services, products and special offers we think you"ll find valuable.

Generally by providing the requested data you consent to AA using that data for administrative purposes and for informing you of other products and services by post, SMS, telephone, mobile telephone and/or email. We may also use the information we collect to occasionally notify you about important functionality changes to the website.

Each time you receive marketing information or a message, you have the option to decline to receive further marketing information from us. This is known as an "opt-out". If you wish to exercise the opt-out, write to The Secretary, AA Ireland Ltd, 56 Drury Street, Dublin 2, email us at aadataprotection@aaireland.ie or telephone us at (01) 617 9950. If you have more than one address or email address please make sure to notify any changes to your preferences for each address or email address you have registered with us.

As required by the Data Protection Acts 1988 and 2003, we follow strict security procedures in the storage and disclosure of information you have given to us

If we provide information to a third party (either a provider of a product or service, or an external data processing agency such as a mailing house) we will exercise the strictest control over the third party contractually, requiring it and any of its agents and/or suppliers to:

  * Online Membership purchase
  * Travel Insurance purchase (one trip, five star, frequent)
  * Car Insurance Application
  * Home Insurance Application
  * Contact Us email enquiries
  * Subscription to the AA Ireland Mailing List



In addition, we will restrict the information disclosed to the absolute minimum necessary, for example, to provide the product or service.

Our own security procedures mean that we may occasionally have to request proof of Identity.

In the event of telephone calls from you, we also reserve the right to ask security questions (which we in our sole discretion deem appropriate), in order to satisfy ourselves that you are who you say you are. Telephone calls may be recorded for the purposes of training and customer service.  
  
  
Your consent  
  
Before you provide any data to us, we will endeavour to make it clear why we need it. Sometimes we may need sensitive personal data (examples might be past medical history or motoring convictions). When this is required we will obtain your consent first. Otherwise, by providing us with information, either orally or written, or by using our website, you consent to the collection, use and processing of this information by AA as set out herein including to provide and send you information about their services.

Subsequent to your purchase of a product or service, we may enter into an arrangement for that service to be provided by a new third party. If this happens, the terms and conditions of your contract with us will provide that you consent to the transfer and processing of personal and/or sensitive personal data to the new provider, subject to the requirement of the Data Protection Acts 1988 and 2003 and associated regulations.

If you are an AA member/customer, you consent to the AA keeping you up to date about AA member/customer benefits and savings available from time to time under which, as part of the benefit of being a member/customer, the AA will, through its magazine, email or otherwise, give you information and details of any discounts or offers it may negotiate from time to time on behalf of its members and customers.
