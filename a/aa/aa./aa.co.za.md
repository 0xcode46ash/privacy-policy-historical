# AA Privacy Policy - The AA of South Africa

We respect and are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy lets you know how your personal information is processed and used.

We promise that we will take steps to use your personal information only in ways that are compatible with this Privacy Policy. This policy is only in effect for the AA website aa.co.za, AA newsletters and email related communications. The following discloses our Privacy Policy.

aa.co.za does track which content you access on an individual basis, however individual information on accessed content is deemed private and is therefore not made public. This information is only used internally at the AA as it relates to our business processes, customer care and in the overall processes of improving our business and service offering.

#### What information is collected and how it is collected?

Every computer connected to the Internet is given a domain name and a set of numbers, which serve as that computer's "Internet Protocol" IP address. When a visitor requests a page from www.aa.co.za our Web servers automatically recognize that visitor's domain name and IP address. The domain name and IP address reveal nothing personal about you other than the IP address from which you have accessed our site. We use this information to examine website interactivity. Our Web servers do not record e-mail addresses of the visitors.

#### How we use single-pixel gifs or tracking scripts?

aa.co.za uses both single-pixel gif images and tracking scripts, sometimes referred to as web bugs or web beacons, to evaluate website interactivity and gather both general statistical information and individual information relating to content accessed. The AA uses tracking scripts that can track personal information from cookies that may have been previously placed on a user's computer as well as having the ability to individually identify users who have interacted with email communications sent from the AA.

#### What other information do we request?

We may also request your personal details including but not limited to name, e-mail address, mailing address for the purposes of registering as a site user, buyer or seller, conducting a survey or to provide additional services (for example, subscriptions to e-mail newsletters, announcement lists or information). Whenever we request the identity of a visitor, we will clearly indicate the purpose of the inquiry before the information is requested. We maintain a strict "No-Spam" policy. We will also not sell or rent your e-mail address to a third-party.

When you enter a contest or other promotion, we may ask for your name, address and e-mail address so that we can administer the contest and notify winners.

#### Will we disclose the information we collect to outside, third parties?

The AA the owners of the www.aa.co.za website will disclose personal information when required by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to:

  * Conform to the edicts of the law or comply with a legal process served on the AA 
  * Protect and defend the rights or property ofthe  AA or visitors to aa.co.za 
  * Identify persons who may be violating the law, the legal notice, or the rights of third parties
