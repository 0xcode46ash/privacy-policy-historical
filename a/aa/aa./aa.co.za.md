This information is used internally only at the AA as it relates to our business processes, customer care and in the overall processes of improving our   
business and service offering.

**What information is collected and how is it collected?**

Every computer connected to the Internet is given a domain name and a set of numbers, which serve as that computer's "Internet Protocol" (IP) address. When a visitor requests a page from [www.aa.co.za](https://web.archive.org/web/20170907033001id_/https%3A//www.aa.co.za/www.aa.co.za), [www.facebook.com/AASouthAfrica](https://web.archive.org/web/20170907033001id_/https%3A//www.aa.co.za/www.facebook.com/AASouthAfrica), [www.twitter.com/AASouthAfrica](https://web.archive.org/web/20170907033001id_/https%3A//www.aa.co.za/www.twitter.com/AASouthAfrica), [www.twitter.com/MyAATraffic](https://web.archive.org/web/20170907033001id_/https%3A//www.aa.co.za/www.twitter.com/MyAATraffic), <https://plus.google.com/+aasouthafrica/posts>, [www.linkedin.com/company/automobile-association-of-south-africa?trk=biz-companies-cym](https://web.archive.org/web/20170907033001id_/https%3A//www.aa.co.za/www.linkedin.com/company/automobile-association-of-south-africa?trk=biz-companies-cym), [www.aaecard.co.za](https://web.archive.org/web/20170907033001id_/https%3A//www.aa.co.za/www.aaecard.co.za) or [aacommunity.aa.co.za](https://web.archive.org/web/20170907033001id_/https%3A//www.aa.co.za/aacommunity.aa.co.za), our web servers automatically recognise that visitor's domain name and IP address.   
The domain name and IP address reveal nothing personal about you other than the IP address from which you have accessed our site. We use this information to examine website interactivity. Our web servers do not record e-mail addresses of visitors.

**How are single-pixel GIFs or tracking scripts used?**

**What other information is requested?**

We may also request your personal details, including but not limited to, name, e-mail address, mailing address for the purposes of registering as a mobile application user, buyer or seller, conducting a survey or to provide additional services (for example, subscriptions to e-mail newsletters, announcement lists or information). Whenever we need to request the identity of a visitor, we will clearly indicate the purpose of the inquiry before the information is requested. We maintain a strict "No-Spam" policy. We will also not sell or rent your e-mail address to a third-party.  
When you enter a contest or other promotion, we may ask for your name, address and e-mail address so that we can administer the contest and notify winners. Your personal information will be retained by us only for the duration of the event for which the information is required.

**Will we disclose the information we collect to outside, third parties?**

**What else should I know about my privacy when online?**

Ultimately, you are solely responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your personal information. Please be careful and responsible whenever you're online.  
This is how we will handle information we learn about you from your visit to our website. The information we receive depends upon what you do when visiting our site.

**Automatic information**

This information enables us to run site usage tools and create statistics about our site. These statistics give us a better understanding of how our site is being used and what we can do to make it more useful to visitors. If you are an existing customer and we have your information already on file, provided that we obtained such personal information with your authorisation, we may use individual information or aggregated information to enhance our relationship with you or improve our service.

**Information you provide us**

We use the information that you provide us (both online and offline) to respond to your requests, customize the material presented to you, based on your past visits to our website, to communicate with you, to improve the content of our website and to improve our service offering. The primary goal in collecting personal information is to provide you with customised services, features and content and to give you an efficient personalised experience that best meets your needs.

If you choose to identify yourself by sending us an e-mail, interacting with an e-mail sent to you or completing an online form, AA employees will have access to such information to contact you for follow-up and direct marketing purposes. We also aggregate information on what pages you access. Website interaction and information submitted by you, such as survey information and/or comments or feedback, may be stored in a personally identifiable format and will be used only for internal purposes and will not be shared with people or organisations outside of AA.

**Use of "Cookies"**

"Cookies" are small files placed on your hard drive that assist us in providing customised and personalised services. No personal information is stored in this cookie.

From time to time, the AA may send a cookie to your computer. A cookie is a small piece of data sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your computer's hard drive. A cookie can't read data off your hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites. Cookies do not damage your system. We use cookies to identify unique website users and the areas of the AA website you have visited. This information may be used to personalise our services to you. We do not record any information other than how you interact with the AA website.

You can choose whether to accept cookies by changing the settings of your browser. You can reset your browser to refuse all cookies, or allow your browser to show you when a cookie is being sent. If you choose not to accept these cookies, your experience at our site and other websites may be diminished and some features may not work as intended.

The AA uses remarketing to reach users who have previously visited specific pages on the AA website and to communicate relevant messages to users, related to the content on that page and the user’s interest. These ads will be shown on sites across the internet by third-party vendors including Google who use cookies to serve ads based on the user’s past visits on the AA website.

Users can opt-out of use of cookies by visiting the double click opt-out page.

AA cannot be held liable for a user’s personalised information changing or being deleted as a result of the user’s disablement or deletion of cookies.

**E-mail Communication**

The AA, from time-to-time, distributes an online newsletter and announcements relating to AA services that we believe will interest AA clients. The AA recognises that users may not wish to be contacted about new or related services; therefore, you may opt-out of any e-mail marketing or newsletters that may result from use of the site. When you receive an e-mail, you will be given instructions on how to remove yourself from that list.

All our e-mail communications are tracked to evaluate interaction success and to understand better how stakeholders are responding to communications. Typically, the AA uses e-mail tagging to identify the links in the e-mail on which you click, on and how you interact with the [www.aa.co.za](https://web.archive.org/web/20170907033001id_/https%3A//www.aa.co.za/www.aa.co.za) website, [www.facebook.com/AASouthAfrica](https://web.archive.org/web/20170907033001id_/https%3A//www.aa.co.za/www.facebook.com/AASouthAfrica), [www.twitter.com/AASouthAfrica](https://web.archive.org/web/20170907033001id_/https%3A//www.aa.co.za/www.twitter.com/AASouthAfrica), [www.twitter.com/MyAATraffic](https://web.archive.org/web/20170907033001id_/https%3A//www.aa.co.za/www.twitter.com/MyAATraffic), <https://plus.google.com/+aasouthafrica/posts>, [www.linkedin.com/company/automobile-association-of-south-africa?trk=biz-companies-cym](https://web.archive.org/web/20170907033001id_/https%3A//www.aa.co.za/www.linkedin.com/company/automobile-association-of-south-africa?trk=biz-companies-cym), [www.aaecard.co.za](https://web.archive.org/web/20170907033001id_/https%3A//www.aa.co.za/www.aaecard.co.za) and [aacommunity.aa.co.za](https://web.archive.org/web/20170907033001id_/https%3A//www.aa.co.za/aacommunity.aa.co.za).
