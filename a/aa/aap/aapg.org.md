##### App privacy policy 

###### Effective from: 13 February 2017 

The American Association of Petroleum Geologists (AAPG) is committed to protecting your privacy. This privacy policy explains how we will do this. AAPG and any company and legal entity owned or controlled by AAPG from time to time are referred to in this Privacy Policy as “AAPG Publications”, "we", "us", or "our". The AAPG Publications is committed to protecting your privacy online. We will review this privacy policy in the light of comments we receive so please check the latest version. If you have any questions about this privacy policy, please contact us by e-mailing us at . 

By using our application (“App”), you are accepting the terms and conditions set out in this privacy policy. 

##### Scope of policy 

This privacy policy applies to your use of our App (once you have downloaded or streamed a copy of the App onto your device) and to the services that we provide through our App. 

A number of third parties have links on our App. If you click on any of those links, they may collect your information. Those third parties' services or sites linked to our application are not within our control and are not covered by this privacy policy. Third parties may have their own privacy policies and we do not accept any responsibility or liability for those policies. Please check those policies before you submit any data to such third parties. 

##### What kind of information do we collect? 

We may collect and process the following information about you: 

Information that you provide when you access the App. This may include your name, e-mail address, or Association membership details. Personal information submitted in this way may be checked against our access control database, and/or added to our customer databases. This information will be updated if you inform us of any changes. 

Records of correspondence if you contact us. We request personal information (such as your name, e-mail address and other contact details) from you when you contact us with subscription management queries, technical problems, to comment on the App, or when you ask for information about how to use the products and/or services made available in the App. Personal information submitted by you via the "contact us" feature will not be added to our customer databases and we request it simply so that we can respond to you about your query. Statistics regarding the types of queries submitted to us via the "contact us" page may be collated by us in aggregate form so that we can effectively monitor the App and improve levels of service. 

Details of your use of the App including (but not limited to) traffic data, weblogs, and other communication data and the resources that you accessed. 

Usage and viewing data, and IP address when you use our App or services that are related to our App. 

Information you provide to us when you use our App. This includes information provided by you when you use our App on third-party platforms or sites e.g. social networking sites, or link your profile on a third-party site or platform with your registration account. 

##### How do we use your information? 

We use information held about you in the following ways: 

  * To provide you with information, products, or services that you request from us. 
  * To carry out our obligations arising from any contracts entered into between you and us. 
  * To help us understand more about how our App is used and to improve our App. 
  * To detect, investigate, and/or prevent activities that may be unlawful and/or which violate our policies. 
  * We may use information in our customer databases to send you information about us and our products and services that we think may be of interest to you electronically or otherwise. 



You may notify us either in writing or by telephone, fax, or e-mail that you object to being contacted or being contacted in a particular way. If you use more than one e-mail address to communicate with us, please notify us of each e-mail account you use. 

##### When do we share information? 

We do not sell your personal information to third parties. 

We share your information within the AAPG. We also share your information with our licensors, our agents, our distributors, and our suppliers, which assists us in making our App and any related products and services available to you (e.g. our hosting supplier). 

If you are subscriber through AAPG, your personal information may be used to enable us to verify that you are an AAPG member. 

If you sign up for services that are managed or offered by other organizations, they will obtain your information and their privacy policy may apply to you. 

If we believe that your use of our App or the related services are unlawful or damaging to others, we reserve the right to disclose the information we have obtained about you to third parties to the extent that it is reasonably necessary in our opinion to prevent, remedy or take action in relation to your conduct. 

We may also disclose or share your personal data in order to comply with any legal obligation; in order to enforce or apply any agreements or licences with you; or to protect the rights, property, or safety of AAPG, our employees, affiliates, agents, distributors, licensors, suppliers, and/or our customers. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for the purposes of fraud protection and credit risk reduction. 

If any part of our business is sold or integrated with another business, your details may be disclosed to our advisers and any prospective purchasers and their advisers. 

##### Advertising 

We may engage network providers to show you other products or services you may be interested in. To find out more about the identity of the advertising network provider(s), please point the cursor of your mouse on the top right hand corner of the adverts(s) and left click. 

While the third-party advertisers may obtain your information via their advertising network solution, we do not provide any personally identifiable information to adverting network providers or third-party advertisers. 

##### Security and our partners outside North America 

As a major international publisher, committed to the widest possible dissemination of scholarship and learning, AAPG has links with other organizations throughout the world. We exchange information with our overseas branches, associated companies and other parties, including distributors and sales agents. As such, from time to time, we may transfer, store and/or process information about you at a destination outside of the United States of America. We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this privacy policy. By using our App, you consent to these transfers. 

The transmission of information via the Internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted through the Internet; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your data, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorized access. 

##### Updating your details and contacting us 

If you have any questions or queries regarding this privacy policy or if any of the information that you have provided to AAPG changes e.g. if you change your e-mail address, please contact us by sending an e-mail to . 

##### Changes to our privacy policy 

We reserve the right to make changes to this privacy policy. Any changes we may make to this privacy policy will be posted on this page and, where appropriate, notified to you by e-mail.
