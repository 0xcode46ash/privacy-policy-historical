# AAPT -> About -> Regulatory Compliance -> AAPT Privacy Awareness Policy

AAPT is committed to the privacy of AAPT customer�s personal information and records and for your information we have documented AAPT�s information handling practices below. Please contact AAPT on 13 88 86 if you wish to discuss any aspect of AAPT�s information handling practices.

##### Is AAPT bound by the National Privacy Principles or an approved Privacy Code?

As a private sector company, AAPT is bound by the Privacy Act 1988. Under the Act, AAPT can choose to develop and be bound by a Privacy Code or choose to comply with the National Privacy Principles in the Privacy Act 1988. AAPT has chosen to be bound by the National Privacy Principles.

##### Personal information held by AAPT

AAPT only collects personal information from you that is necessary for it to perform its functions. The personal information AAPT holds about you will depend on the services you request from AAPT and the use that you make of those services. However, your personal information may include: 

  * your name, address and contact details;
  * your date of birth;
  * account name and account number held by financial institutions from which payments for services provided by AAPT are made and information obtained as a result of credit checks which you authorise us to carry out;
  * records of communications between you and AAPT relating to services provided by AAPT to you;
  * call charge records;
  * billing statements.



##### Use of your personal information

AAPT respects your privacy, so AAPT does not trade, rent or sell your personal information to any third parties.

The primary purpose for which we use your personal information is to provide you with telecommunications services. This includes the provision of fixed line, mobile and Internet services.

In the course of providing telecommunications services to you, we may also use your personal information for related purposes, which include the following:

  * Provisioning or connecting your service;
  * Network routing;
  * Providing you with a customer service;
  * Credit checking;
  * Billing you for that service;
  * Investigating complaints in relation to your service;
  * Investigating and fixing faults in relation to your service;
  * Following up any payments that you may owe us;
  * To administer contractual agreements or arrangements necessary to provide services to you;
  * Disconnecting your service.



We may also use your personal information to tell you about our other products and services or bundled offerings, provided by AAPT in conjunction with either our related bodies corporate or our business partners or associates.

##### How AAPT collects personal information

AAPT collects personal information directly from you when you supply it to us in connection with a request for services. AAPT may also collect personal information from third parties such as:

  * resellers of telecommunication services;
  * external contractors;
  * credit providers or credit reporting agencies contacted by us (or by external service providers on our behalf) in the course of carrying out a credit check; 
  * other entities who provide services to us related to the provision of telecommunication services provided to you;
  * government agencies which administer laws regulating telecommunication service providers, or complaint resolution processes established under those laws;
  * independent sales organisations.



##### Contracting out services and disclosures

AAPT contracts out some services such as mailing invoices and other information and correspondence to you, credit checking, provisioning, marketing, and fault fixing, to external contractors, or service providers. AAPT contracts out the promotion and sale of some of our products and services to independent sales organisations. AAPT may disclose personal information to the external contractors, service providers or sales organisations. At your request, AAPT may disclose your information to directory providers so that your information can appear in telephone directories. Any disclosure of personal information is limited to that required to provide you with the services that AAPT has contracted out. AAPT may also disclose your information to our related bodies corporate and our business partners and associates.

At all times, parties to which we contract services or disclose your personal information are either covered by contracts which protect your personal information or are required to comply with all relevant laws including the Privacy Act 1988.

##### Access to Personal Information

Generally, you have the right to see or obtain a copy of personal information about you that we may hold.

AAPT will handle requests for access to personal information in accordance with the National Privacy Principles.

To request access to your personal information, please contact our Call Centre on 13 88 86.

As long as we can adequately verify your identity, the person you speak to may be able to provide you with the information you require over the telephone. If you wish to have a copy of any information, we will ask that you put your request in writing and either post or fax that request to us. Again, this is to ensure that we can verify your identity.

In some cases, we may need time to consider and respond to your request for access. If we need time to consider your request, we will acknowledge your request within 14 days and respond within a maximum of 30 days.

Depending on the information you wish to access, where it is stored and the time it will take us to respond to your request for access, we may charge you a fee for the administrative cost of providing the information to you.

If for any reason we refuse to give you access to your information we will let you know why, in writing.

The circumstances in which we may refuse to give you access to personal information we hold about you include where giving you access: 

  * would have an unreasonable impact on other people's privacy;
  * would prejudice any negotiations we are having with you;
  * would prejudice an investigation of unlawful activity;
  * would prejudice activities carried out by, or for, a law enforcement body.



If you believe that we hold personal information about you that you consider to be inaccurate, incomplete or out of date you should tell us by calling 13 88 86. In most cases, we will amend any inaccurate, incomplete or out of date information. In some cases it is necessary for us to keep a record of what we know or understand to be correct at a particular time. However, in those circumstances, if you request, we will take reasonable steps to associate with the relevant record of your personal information a statement to the effect that you claim the information is inaccurate, incomplete or out of date. We would ask that you discuss your request with us by calling 13 88 86. 

##### Changes to this Privacy Awareness Policy

From time to time, it may be necessary for us to review our Privacy Awareness Policy. We reserve the right to amend our Privacy Awareness Policy at any time and to notify you by posting an updated version on the AAPT website www.aapt.com.au
