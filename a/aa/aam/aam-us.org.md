# Privacy Policy

The American Alliance of Museums (“we”, “us,” or “AAM” or with “our”) has developed this policy (“Privacy Policy”) to assist end users (referenced herein with “you” or “user” or with “your”) of AAM’s Web site located at [http://www.aam-us.org](http://www.aam-us.org/) (“Site”) in understanding the personally identifiable information (“PII”) collection and use practices for AAM’s Site. PII (as such term is used in this Privacy Policy) describes information that can identify a specific individual, such as, without limitation, a name, address, phone number, and/or e-mail address.   AAM reserves the right to change this Privacy Policy at any time to address changes to its information collection, disclosure, or use practices or changes in law. If AAM makes changes to this Privacy Policy, AAM will post those changes at this location and provide notice of any material changes. Please review this Privacy Policy on a periodic basis. By using the Site, you signify your acknowledgement and acceptance of this Privacy Policy. 

## 1.    Data Collection

AAM may request or require you to provide certain PII, including, without limitation, your name, e-mail address, date of birth, credit card information or certain demographic information ( _e.g._ , employment data such as organization, title and position) when you seek access to certain portions of the Site, apply for AAM membership, join an AAM online community, apply for certain job opportunities, and/or pay for anything available for purchase on the Site. We also use this information to improve the features, tools, functionality and content available on the Site or through AAM, which may include use of such information in certain transactions or sharing arrangements with AAM’s business partners. 

We also collect and maintain aggregate information about the transactions that occur on the Site ( _e.g._ , tool or feature utilization, registration information, and activity, navigation, or content selection data).

Moreover, the Site utilizes “cookies” to record session information, such as items that consumers add to their shopping carts.  Cookies are generally pieces of information, which AAM uses for record-keeping purposes and which the Site may transfer to us and/or your computer’s Web-browser for storage on our server(s) or your computer’s hard drive.  Cookies enable AAM to manage and/or customize your experience on the Site.  Cookies also make Web-surfing or site review easier by automatically performing certain functions such as saving your personal preferences and by providing targeted content. AAM, however, will not use cookies to record passwords or credit card or other financial information. 

In the event that AAM undergoes a business transaction or event involving the sale of all or a portion of its assets, please note that the PII collected and retained by AAM may be among the assets transferred or reviewed.  ****

AAM may disclose PII when legally required to do so in accordance with subpoenas, government requests or regulations, or legal proceedings.  AAM may also disclose PII to protect against misuse or unauthorized use of the Site or as is otherwise required to limit legal liability, protect or defend our rights, property, or interests, or protect the safety, rights, or property of others.

## 2.      Contact With You and Opting-Out

The collection, use, and sharing of your PII is necessary for AAM membership. Use of PII may also be necessary for AAM to provide certain features, programs, events, resources and services made available on the Site, and to operate and/or improve the Site. For example, users who register for certain events or purchase resources available on the AAM Site will need to agree to AAM’s collection and use of PII. However, under other circumstances you can decide on your own if you wish to provide your PII or opt-out of doing so. For example, if AAM conducts a survey on the Site, you do not have to participate unless you agree to do so. 

AAM also provides you with the opportunity to opt-out of certain AAM business practices that may involve the use of your PII.  For example, if you do not want to receive e-mail communications from us in the future, please let us know by contacting us through e-mail, telephone or written correspondence per the contact information provided in Section 5 below.  Moreover, you may contact AAM, per the contact information provided in Section 5, to opt-out of certain sharing arrangements with third parties.
