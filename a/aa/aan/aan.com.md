# American Academy of Neurology®

This Privacy Policy explains how the American Academy of Neurology and its subsidiary (collectively, "AAN") collect and use information through our website ( [www.aan.com](https://www.aan.com/)), together with all other websites owned or operated by the AAN (collectively, the "Website"). This Privacy Policy also generally explains how the AAN collects and uses information through other voluntary interactions with the AAN. By visiting the Website, becoming an AAN member, or otherwise voluntarily submitting information to the AAN, you consent to our collection and use of your personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

Specific policies related to collection and use of information through certain AAN interactions, activities, or programs may be noted and addressed within that interaction, activity, or program (e.g., the Data Governance Policy governs information collected via the Axon Registry® clinical data registry).

The AAN has engaged a third-party publisher to help us manage many of our publications and allow us to better serve our readers. Personal information submitted to AAN publications, including through third-party managed webpages, may be shared with the publisher and related service providers, as necessary for completing authorized transactions. Publication websites include: [Neurology®](http://www.neurology.org/) , [Continuum®](http://journals.lww.com/continuum/) , [Neurology Today®](http://journals.lww.com/neurotodayonline/) , and [Neurology Now®](http://journals.lww.com/neurologynow/) . The publisher's collection and use of any personal information it collects via these sites is subject to the publisher's privacy policy, accessible via the footer of each publication site.

The AAN also provides external links to other websites. Once you enter another website (whether through an advertisement, service or content link), the AAN is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of each website that you visit.

#### Information We Collect

 _Anonymous and Aggregated Web Traffic Information_. General traffic, site usage, browser information, length-of-stay information, and location data, is collected and stored in log files. This type of information is collected and shared on an anonymous, aggregated basis.

 _Personal Information (non-financial)_. We collect all or some of the following personal information: first and last name, street address, city, state, zip code, telephone number, email address, and subject of inquiry, in the following contexts:

  *  _AAN Member Customized Website_ : To gain access to members-only resources and personalization features on the Website, AAN members are asked to provide a unique user ID and password. The AAN's web server tracks the domain names and IP addresses (not the individual e-mail addresses) of members entering the members-only area, but only for purposes of measuring the general number of visits, pages visited, average time spent on the site, etc. We may collect and track your contact information (address and phone number) and AAN Member ID number. As an AAN member, when you personalize the Website, we retain the preferences you select so that you will not have to reenter the information each time you access our Website. You can access your profile by entering your user name and password each time you use the Website. When you're logged in, we can see your member ID and your location.
  *  _Registration_ : If you register to participate in an AAN event, program, or promotion using online or paper registration forms, we collect and store your name, address, phone number, email address, and any additional information you voluntarily provide on the registration form.
  *  _Membership Application_ : If you apply to become an AAN member, using online or paper application forms, we collect and store your name, address, phone number, email address, and any additional information you voluntarily provide on the application form.
  *  _Requests_ : We collect information volunteered by users, including from surveys or requests via "Contact AAN." We also may collect the email addresses of those who communicate with us via email.
  *  _Find a Neurologist_ : We disclose contact information to the public that you provide if you elect to participate in the Find a Neurologist directory: <https://patients.aan.com/findaneurologist/>.
  *  _AAN Member Search_ : We disclose the contact information AAN members provide in the AAN Member Directory. The directory is a reference tool for AAN members only. Users of the directory may not provide the contact information (name, email address, phone number) contained in the directory to others or use it for promotional or survey purposes without the written permission of the AAN. Excessive use or abuse of the directory may result in loss of access for the user.
  *  _Products_ : We may collect some contact information you're explicitly asked to provide in connection with certain AAN products (e.g., NeuroSAE®).



 _Financial Information_. When you place an order online with us, register for a conference, or pay your dues electronically, standard credit card information (card number, card type, expiration date, etc.) is collected through a third-party payer who is compliant with Payment Card Industry data security standards. The third-party payer provides us with, and we store the last four digits of your credit-card number, which is retained for purposes of issuing applicable refunds.

 _Protected Health Information_. The AAN does not collect "protected health information" as defined by the regulations issued under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) of 1996 via the Website.

The Axon Registry®, via AAN's registry vendor (FIGmd), collects relevant patient data and performs statistical analysis to improve the quality of neurologic care and patient outcomes. The AAN and FIGmd comply with the laws and regulations applicable to the Axon Registry and have adopted HIPAA Privacy Policies and Procedures. To further describe the collection, use, disclosure, and stewardship of Axon Registry data, the AAN adopted the Axon Registry Data Governance Policy.

  * Disclosure of mailing information to commercial third parties only for US attendees of the AAN Annual Meeting who have not opted out of commercial mailings (when registering for the AAN Annual Meeting, US attendees have the option of opting out of having their contact information provided to commercial entities involved in the Annual Meeting for the purpose of hardcopy mailings, invitations, and emails from those commercial entities);
  * Disclosure to private entities and law enforcement or other government officials as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate (a) to investigate or resolve possible problems or inquiries, (b) to conform to legal requirements or comply with legal process served on the AAN, (c) to protect our own business and assets, or (d) in special cases, such as a physical threat to you or others; and
  * Other disclosures for which you have consented to such use in an agreement between you and the AAN.



Whenever we disclose your personal information to third parties, we will make commercially reasonable efforts to limit the information to which third parties have access and require that the recipients of the information keep it confidential and use it only for the purposes designated by the AAN.

We will not knowingly give or sell your email address to any unrelated entity outside the AAN without your consent, except as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy.

 **WARNING** : Companies unaffiliated with the AAN are advertising the sale of AAN Annual Meeting contact lists that they may represent include attendee e-mail addresses. The AAN has no relationship with and has not provided contact information to companies claiming to be selling these lists. The AAN only releases US attendee e-mail addresses in the limited circumstances described in this Privacy Policy. Any company claiming to sell AAN attendee contact information will be issued a cease and desist letter, and the AAN will pursue appropriate legal action, to the extent possible. These companies appear to be attempting to defraud or deceive through their misrepresentations and false advertising. AAN members, meeting attendees, and exhibitors are encouraged to ignore these emails.

If you no longer wish to receive emails from us, it may take up to 48 hours for your opt-out request to become effective. If you no longer wish to receive postal mail from us, it may take up to 6 weeks for your opt-out request to become effective.
