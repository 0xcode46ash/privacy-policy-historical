### With whom is non-personal information shared?

Because non-personal information does not identify who you are, we do not limit the ways we may use or share non-personal information. For example, we may share non-personal information with our affiliates, suppliers, employees and agents, other businesses, and the government. 

### Personal information provided by you

“Personal information”means information that specifically identifies you as an individual, such as your full name, telephone number, email address, postal address, or certain account numbers. As used in this Website Privacy Policy, personal information does not include information protected under HIPAA, which would be protected as described in the HIPAA Notices of Privacy Practices of your health plans or physicians and other health care professionals.

This website may include web pages that give you the opportunity to provide us with personal information about yourself. **You do not have to provide us with personal information if you do not want to; however, that may limit your ability to use certain functions of this website or to request certain services or information**.

We may share personal information with other affiliates or business units within the Company.

We also share and give access to personal information with other companies that we hire to perform services on our behalf or collaborate with.

Similarly, we may hire outside companies to host or operate some of our websites and related computers and software applications. 

However, if we share or give access to personal information to outside companies we require them to use the personal information only for limited purposes, such as for sending you the email in the example above.
