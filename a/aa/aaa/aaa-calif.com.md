# Privacy Notice - Automobile Club of Southern California

## Privacy Notice

The Auto Club and its affiliates respect your privacy. We want to assure you that safeguarding information about you is important to us. We gather nonpublic personal information about you only to conduct business on your behalf, provide superior service, and communicate offers on products and services that we believe will be of interest or benefit to you.

**Information we collect.** We collect, from you or other sources, information such as your name, address and telephone number. We also collect information about your transactions with us, with our affiliates, or with others, such as purchases related to the use of your membership card.

**Information we share.** We share information about you with our affiliates and non-affiliates, such as companies that perform marketing services on our behalf or financial institutions with whom we have joint marketing agreements. Because we value the trust you’ve placed in us, we require that these companies keep the information we send them confidential and limit their use of it to the purposes for which we send it to them, such as notifying you of special offers. We also provide information about you to others as permitted or required by law for specific, limited purposes, such as processing transactions you request (towing, DMV), responding to subpoenas or government agencies.

**Information protection.** We protect nonpublic personal information about you by restricting access to employees who need to know that information to provide products or services to you. We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to guard this nonpublic personal information.

This notice is being provided on behalf of the following:  
Automobile Club of Southern California  
AAA Club Services, LLC   


Note: The words "you," and "your," as used in this notice, mean an individual, including a former customer, who seeks to obtain, obtains, or has obtained a product or service from the Auto Club or an affiliate that is to be used primarily for personal, family or household purposes.

## Online Practices

**Web site information.** We collect information from our web site that you give to us. We use the information you provide to facilitate your requests, process any transactions you might initiate, or update your account.

Our web servers automatically recognize and record the domain name from which you access the Internet and the names of the pages you visit while at our site. We use the information that we get from your visit for internal tracking purposes, to make our site as useful and interesting to you as we can, to respond to your request for information or other services, and to advise you of services and products. 

We collect information about the type and version of browser software you are using to enable us to properly display information and for statistical purposes, but we cannot use this information to identify you.

Secure transactions are accomplished with Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology to assure that your data is safely communicated to us.

**E-mail Addresses.** If you supply us with your e-mail address, we may let you know by e-mail about special marketing offers for products and services that may be of interest to you. This may include travel discounts and special offers. With each special marketing offer e-mail message we send, we will provide you with the opportunity to tell us that you do not wish to receive special marketing offer e-mail messages from us in the future. However, we reserve the right to service your account and communicate with you through e-mail about your account. 

**Use of "Cookies."** We use a feature of your Internet browser called a "cookie" (small file placed on the user’s hard drive) to facilitate site navigation, Internet sessions, and to maintain security. For example, we use cookies to remember your personal settings, pre-fill forms for you, and to monitor your use of our web site to improve our services. We do not use cookies for any other purpose. If you choose not to enable cookies on your browser, you will not be able to use some of the services offered on our web site.
