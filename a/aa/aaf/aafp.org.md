#### From AAFP members, meeting registrants, purchasers of products from the AAFP catalog and other customers:

If a member has logged into a password-protected area of an AAFP Web site, the user's name and member ID number are recorded.

In addition, the member may be asked to update their member contact information.

 _Important note for AAFP members:_ The AAFP maintains a membership database independent of its Web operations. The information from this database is drawn from membership applications, dues payment forms, subscriptions, product orders, CME reporting, member surveys and other correspondence between the AAFP and its members. 

If a non-member registers for a meeting, purchases a product from the AAFP's Web site or claims CME credit for an online course, the user's name, address and other personal identifying information are recorded. In some instances, demographic information is collected and recorded.   
_  
Credit Card information:_ The AAFP does not disclose credit card account information or activity provided by its customers. When members and customers choose to pay using their credit cards, the AAFP submits this information encrypted to obtain payment from the appropriate clearing house. If credit card numbers are stored in AAFP databases, they are encrypted.

The AAFP shares membership, demographic, CME and/or contact information with AAFP constituent chapters and its Foundation. 

On occasion, the AAFP may also provide limited data to third parties that offer CME, products or services deemed of interest to the clinical or socioeconomic practice of medicine. These limited data include names and addresses, but do not include phone numbers, fax numbers or e-mail addresses.
