# Privacy - The Aspen Institute

  * The Aspen Institute respects your privacy.  Because the Institute gathers certain types of information from and about our users, we feel you should fully understand our policy and the terms and conditions surrounding the capture and use of that information. This privacy statement discloses what information we gather and how we use it.  Information collected and gathered by the Institute is never sold or rented to any third party.  Under no circumstances does the Institute divulge any information about an individual user to a third party.

#### Use Of Information

The Institute uses information voluntarily given by users to prepare future content based on user interests and to enhance the users’ experiences with Institute sites.  The Institute also uses information that users voluntarily provide in order to send out electronic newsletters and to enable users to participate in polls, surveys, message boards, and forums.  Website visits generate certain information that is automatically stored in log files, including Internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp and clickstream data.  The Institute may also store information collected through cookies, log files and other technologies to create a “profile” of your preferences.  We use this information, which in itself does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users’ movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.

The Institute shares aggregated demographic information with its partners. This information does not identify individual users.  The Institute does not link aggregate user data with personally identifiable information in these cases.

#### Security

The Institute operates secure data networks protected by firewall and password protection systems that are at least industry standard.  The Institute’s security and privacy policies are periodically reviewed and enhanced as necessary.  Only authorized individuals have access to the information provided by Institute constituents.  The security of your sensitive personal information is important to us.  Such information provided in connection with purchases or donations is encrypted end-to-end with industry-standard 128-bit Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology and digital certificates.

#### Opt-Out Policy And Removal Of Personally Identifiable Information

The Institute gives users practical options to remove themselves from Institute mailing lists and from participation in certain interactive areas of the Institute’s websites.  You may correct, update or deactivate your personally identifiable information by e-mailing us at [info@aspeninstitute.org](mailto:info@aspeninstitute.org), or by contacting us by telephone or postal mail at the contact information listed below.

#### Commenting Policy

In keeping with our mission to provide a nonpartisan venue for dealing with and discussing critical issues, the Aspen Institute welcomes comments on our website and across its other social media and online platforms. We welcome strong opinions and comments. The opinions expressed in these comments are not necessarily those of the Aspen Institute. Comments that the Institute deems to include profanity, hate speech, personal attacks, or libelous, defamatory, discriminatory, obscene, pornographic, abusive or otherwise illegal (including violations of copyright or trademark laws) or unacceptable material may be removed. We reserve the right to block or remove the posting privileges of commenters who violate these standards of decorum at any time.

#### Children

Consistent with the Federal Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA), we will never knowingly request personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13 without requesting parental consent.

#### Legal Disclaimer

The Institute reserves the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as required by law and when it believes that disclosure is necessary to protect the Institute’s rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order or legal process.

The Institute reserves the right to modify this privacy statement at any time.  If the Institute makes material changes to this policy, we will notify you here, by email, or by means of a notice on the Institute’s home page.
