# Online Graduate, Undergraduate, and Certificate Programs - Aspen University

## Privacy Policy  


### **FERPA**

**The Family Rights and Privacy Act of 1974** , as amended, (commonly known as the Buckley Amendment) is a federal law which provides that schools will maintain the confidentiality of student education records. The law basically says that no one outside the institution shall have access to students' education records nor will the institution disclose any information from those records without the written consent of students.

In compliance with FERPA, the following statement reflects Aspen University's policy:

_The following directory information may be released by telephone:  
a) student's dates of attendance;   
b) date of graduation and degree or certificate earned. _

_Other kinds of directory information, such as a student's address, telephone listing, program of study, awards received, and the most recent previous education agency or previous institution attended, will be released only in response to a written request._

_Aspen University reserves the right to refuse the above information if the reason for the request is not considered to be a sufficient need to know. Information regarding the student's record: grades, courses, GPA, social security number and other personal information will not be released without the student's written consent._

Each student has the right to inform Aspen University that any or all of the information is not to be released. This status is binding until such time that Aspen University is notified in writing by the student to permit release of "directory information".   


**Parental Access to Children's Education Records:**  
At Aspen University, parents or gaurdians have no inherent rights to inspect a student's education record. The right to inspect is limited solely to the student. Records will be released to parents only under the following circumstances: (1) through the written consent of the student, (2) in compliance with a subpoena, or (3) by producing a copy of the most recent Federal Income Tax form showing that the student was claimed as a dependent. 

**Posting of Grades by Faculty:**  
The public posting of grades either by the student's name, institutional student identification number, or security number without the student's written permission is a violation of FERPA.
