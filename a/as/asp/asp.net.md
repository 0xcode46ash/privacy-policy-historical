Microsoft is committed to protecting your privacy and to developing technology that gives you the most powerful and secure online experience. This privacy statement explains data collection and use practices of the www.asp.net site (the “Site”) hosted for Microsoft by Divine Inc; it does not apply to other online or offline Microsoft sites, products or services. By accessing the Site, you are consenting to the information collection and use practices described in this privacy statement. 

**Collecting Your Personal Information**  
We will collect personal information if you choose to register for services provided by www.asp.net . The personal information we collect may includes your name, title, company or organization name, work e-mail, work phone, work or home address, information about your job function, information about your company, and credit card information. 

When you visit the Site, certain anonymous information about your visit is automatically captured. This information includes the name of the Internet service provider and the Internet Protocol (IP) address through which you access the Internet; the date and time you access the Site; the pages that you access while at the Site and the Internet address of the Web site from which you linked directly to our site. None of this information is personally-identifiable. This anonymous information is used to help improve the Site, analyze trends, and administer the Site, and is discarded when this process is completed. 

**Use of your Personal Information  
We use your personal information for the following purposes: **

* To understand feature requirements for our services.
* To send updates about our services.

Microsoft occasionally hires other companies to provide limited services on our behalf, including packaging, mailing and delivering prizes, answering customer questions about products and services, sending postal mail, and sending information about our products, special offers, and other new services. We will only provide those companies the personal information they need to deliver the service, and they are prohibited from using that information for any other purpose. 

Microsoft may disclose personal information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to (a) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served to Microsoft, or the Site; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of Microsoft and our family of Web sites; or (c) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of Microsoft, our Web sites, or the public. 

Personally identifiable information collected on this site may be stored and processed in the United States or any other country in which Microsoft or its affiliates, subsidiaries or agents maintain facilities, and by using this site, you consent to any such transfer of information outside of your country. Microsoft abides by the safe harbor framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of data from the European Union. 

**Control of your Personal Information**   
Except as otherwise described in this statement, personal information you provide on this site will not be shared outside of Microsoft and its controlled subsidiaries and affiliates without your permission. It will only be used for the purposes stated above. 

Please be aware that this Privacy Statement and the choices you make on the Site will not necessarily apply to personal information you may have provided to Microsoft in the context of other, separately operated, Microsoft products or services.
