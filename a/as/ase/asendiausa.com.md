# US :: Data Protection & Cookie Policy

Data collected from visitors (“Visitors” or “you”) who access information, content or services published or offered on this website is processed by Asendia Management SAS (France) (“Asendia”, “we” or “us”) in its capacity as both provider of this website and service provider. The above-mentioned information, content or services will be referred to hereinafter as the “Digital Presence” of Asendia. Further details about Asendia Management SAS are available from the [About Asendia](http://www.asendiausa.com/about-asendia) section of the website.

Protection of your personal data is of great importance to us. We therefore, as a matter of routine, handle your personal data responsibly and in compliance with the applicable statutory data protection provisions and postal legislation.

This Data Protection Policy contains information for you about our data processing methods. We explain what data will be processed by us whenever you access this website.

 **1\. Who is the owner of the data collected?**

The owner of the data collected is Asendia Management SAS, with a share capital of 1.000€, 752.460.170 RCS Paris, registered address Cristal Tower, 7 Quai André Citroën, 75015 Paris, France.

 **2\. What data do we collect?**

In principle, our Digital Presence can be used without disclosing any personal data. As is common practice with many websites, certain data such as IP addresses and other usage information, is collected automatically and then analysed and processed anonymously by our web analysis software. By using our Digital Presence you consent to the collection, use and disclosure of this data in accordance with the terms of this Data Protection Policy.

 **2.1 Automatic logging / User-specific and technical data**

Our web servers automatically log every visit in a temporary log file. User-specific data (such as the IP address of the requesting computer and/or device, identification data of the browser used, the operating system of the requesting computer and/or device, the amount of data transferred, the name of the Internet Service Provider, the date and time of access) and technical data (such as the name and URL of the referring web page when the website was accessed via a link and, additionally, the search term if it was accessed via a search engine) are logged and analysed anonymously. First and foremost, this data is needed to enable the use of our content (connection set-up), and is also used for system-related purposes, such as technical administration and system security.

We do not use your data for any other purposes, unless you have given your express consent to additional data processing when using certain services.

 **2.2 Additional data processing / Personal data**

In some cases, to use some of our online services, you must provide some personal data (with or without login). Personal data is information about personal or factual characteristics relating to a specific natural person. This includes information such as your name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, date of birth, employment and job title. We only process personal data when you decide to send it to us; for example, by filling out an online form, as part of a registration, order form, survey, competition, fulfillment of contract, information request or sending us a message via the contact forms.

In these cases, we will only ask you to provide the personal data we require to perform the services we provide. The information you provide us with will be recorded in our IT systems.

 **3\. How do we use your data?**

Collecting data helps us to develop and improve our Digital Presence, optimize our range of services and respond to your requests. We may use the data we collect about you for the following purposes:

  1. to enable your use of the Digital Presence;
  2. for internal, system-related purposes, such as technical administration and system security;
  3. for statistical purposes, in order to enable us to tailor the Digital Presence more closely to your needs through the anonymous evaluation of general user behaviour (see section 4.3 below);
  4. to provide online services and contractually-compliant processing of these services.



When you have given your express consent or - if so stipulated by legal regulations - have not raised an objection, we may also use this data for marketing purposes.

 **4\. Cookie Policy**

 **4.1 What is a cookie?**

A cookie is a small text file containing data for technical session logging and enabling us to store information related to your computer and/or device for the duration of your utilization of the Digital Presence. Cookies help us to determine how frequently our website pages are accessed as well as the number of users. Cookies also allow us to tailor the Digital Presence to your interests and to improve its functionality.

We use "session cookies" and "persistent cookies”. "Session cookies" are stored only for the duration of your visit to one of the pages on our website. "Persistent cookies" are stored to retain information about Visitors who repeatedly access one of the pages on our website. We use cookies to be able to offer you optimal user experiences, remembering your preferences and settings and presenting you varied website pages and new contents during repeated use.

 **4.2 How do we use cookies?**

Our web server places cookies in the memory of your computer and/or device. These cookies allow us an anonymous evaluation of general user behaviour, based on the number of visitors, for the purpose of optimizing our Digital Presence.

You can also use our Digital Presence without cookies. However, most browsers accept cookies by default. You can prevent the saving of each cookie, or receive a warning from your browser before a cookie is saved, by changing your browser settings. Further information about these functions can be found in the help menu of your browser. Non-browser-based solutions do not offer this option. It may be that your use of certain functions or parts of our Digital Presence will be restricted or blocked if you prevent the use of cookies.

 **4.3 Web analytics services**

We use different web analytics services, such as Google Analytics, a network analysis service provided by Google Inc. The web analytics services use cookies (see section 4.1), which evaluate the use of the Digital Presence in order to obtain website traffic information, improve our services and in order to provide a statistical evaluation of our visitor traffic. It is not possible to trace the identity of individuals during these operations. The information generated in this way may be transmitted to a server abroad and stored there. You can prevent cookies from being stored by adjusting the settings of your browser software accordingly (see section 4.2). Data collection and storage can be withdrawn at any time with future effect. For more information, see the Google Analytics privacy policy.

 **4.4 Third party cookies**

We use share buttons on our websites to enable Visitors to share content through social networks. When you click on a share button, a cookie may be placed in the memory of your computer and/or device by the web server of the social network you have chosen to share content through. We do not control the use of or have access to these cookies. For more information, you should refer to the relevant third party’s website.

 **4.5 Third Party Cookies in embedded content**

When visiting pages of our websites with embedded content from YouTube (or similar video-sharing providers), the web server of these websites may place their own cookies in the memory of your computer and/or device. These cookies are not related to Asendia and we do not control the use of or have access to these cookies. For more information, you should refer to the relevant video-sharing provider’s website.

 **5\. Will we share your data with anyone else?**

The personal data processed is not transferred to third parties or otherwise transmitted without your express consent. However, we expressly reserve the right to pass this data on to other companies within the Asendia Group.

We will retain your information for no longer than necessary and it will remain confidential. However, we expressly reserve the right to transfer personal data to governmental institutions and authorities as well as to private persons with a right thereto based on statutory regulations, court orders or regulatory decisions, as well as to transfer personal data to governmental institutions for the purposes of taking legal action or prosecution should our legally protected rights be challenged.

 **6\. Your rights**

 **6.1. Right to access and information**

For any questions regarding the processing of your data, please contact us at the following address: Asendia Management SAS, Branch Bern, Nordring 8, 3030 Bern, Switzerland or [digitalmedia@asendia.com](mailto:mailto:digitalmedia@asendia.com).

Should you wish to contact us by e-mail, please note that e-mails will be in an unencrypted form and will therefore be susceptible to the security risks typically associated with such methods of communication.

 **6.2. Amendment, blocking and deletion / withdrawal of consent**

If you would like any data to be amended, blocked or deleted, please apply together with a copy of your passport or ID to the following address: Asendia Management SAS, Branch Bern, Nordring 8, 3030 Bern, Switzerland or [digitalmedia@asendia.com](mailto:mailto:digitalmedia@asendia.com). If the deletion of any data is not permitted for statutory or contractual reasons or by commercial or tax law, in particular by statutory retention periods, the data will be blocked instead of deleted.

 **7\. How secure is your data?**

The data we collect and save is treated confidentially and, using appropriate technical and organizational precautions, protected from loss or manipulation as well as from unauthorized access by third parties.

In certain cases, information exchanged between your computer and/or device and us is encrypted during transmission. We do not accept liability for any unauthorized access or loss or personal data that is beyond our control.

Our Digital Presence may contain links to other digital solutions which are outside our control and are not covered by this Data Protection Policy. If you access other digital solutions using the links provided, the operators of these digital solutions may collect information from you which will be used by them in accordance with their data protection policy, which may differ from ours.

 **8\. Changes to the Data Protection Policy**

Changes to this Data Protection Policy may be required from time to time, for example due to the ongoing development of our Digital Presence or as a result of changes in legislation. Asendia therefore reserves the right to change the Data Protection Policy at any time, with effect from a future date. Accordingly, we recommend that you re-read this Data Protection Policy on a regular basis. This Data Protection Policy was last updated on: 08.11.2016
