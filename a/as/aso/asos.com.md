# As Seen on Screen - Celebrity Fashion from AsSeenonScreen.com

asSeenonScreen.com are totally committed to protecting the privacy of our site visitors and customers. The asSeenonScreen.com team members are customers themselves of other Internet sites and fully appreciate and respect the importance of privacy on the Internet. We will not disclose information about our customers to third parties except where it is a necessary part of providing a service to you - e.g. Arranging for a product to be sent to you. 

**Your Consent**  
We will not e-mail you in the future unless you have given us your consent. 

When you place an order on line we will need to know your name, address, delivery address, credit or debit card number and expiry date. This will allow you to pay for the items you have ordered and ensure that they are delivered to you at the correct address. 

**We do not sell, rent or trade information about you.** We are required by the UK Data Protection Act 1998 to follow strict security procedures to ensure that stored information is not accessible by unauthorized persons. 

**Why we may request other information about you.**  
Our aim when you visit asSeenonScreen.com, is to provide you with the best and most efficient shopping experience possible. To do this we may ask you for feedback and ask questions about your preferences, in order to understand your shopping habits and provide you with a web site that will be exciting, interesting and useful to you. 

If you enter a competition on our site we will store your details in order to administer the competition and notify winners. 

**Keeping in touch...**  
We may use the information you have submitted to contact you if we feel you may be interested in a product or service offered by asSeenonScreen.com. You will be given the option to delete your personal details from our marketing database if you do not want to be contacted again. 

**Site Statistics**  
We may disclose aggregate statistics about the number of visitors to our site or number of purchases made on the site as required by our investors. RedSheriff, an independent measurement and research company, gathers data regarding the visitors to our site on our behalf using cookies and code which is embedded in the site. Both the cookies and the embedded code provide statistical information about visits to pages on the site, the duration of individual page view, paths taken by visitors through the site, data on visitors' screen settings and other general information. As Seen on Screen uses this type of information, as with that obtained from other cookies used on the site, to help it improve the services to its users. Further information regarding RedSheriff's privacy statement can be found at [http://www.redsheriff.com/](http://www.redsheriff.com/6.0.0.htm). 

**Checking your details**  
If you wish to verify the details you have submitted to asSeenonScreen.com you may do so by contacting us via the e-mail address, telephone number or address given below. Our security procedures mean that we may request proof of identity before we reveal information. This proof of identity will take the form of your e-mail address and password submitted upon registration. We would strongly recommend that you do not use the browser's password memory function as that would permit other people using your terminal to access your personal information - write it down and keep it somewhere safe. 

**What are Cookies?**  
A cookie is a small information file that is sent to your computer and is stored on your hard drive. If you have registered with us then your computer will store an identifying cookie which will save you time each time you re-visit asSeenonScreen.com, by remembering your email address for you. You can change the settings on your browser to prevent cookies being stored on your computer without your explicit consent.
