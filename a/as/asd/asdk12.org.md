How Personal Information is used

> Email
>
>> If you send an email to us, it will be forwarded to those individuals (employees, school board members) necessary to address that email. Email is recognized as written communication and is considered public record. If a request for public information is submitted to the district, any information contained in that email, including the address, could be released.
>> 
>> If you choose to provide personal information about yourself in that email, we will use the information only to respond properly to your request or to fulfill the stated purpose of the communication. We will not disclose any personal information you decide to provide us, unless disclosure is required by state law or school board policy ([School Board Policy 823.51 "Availability of Records"](http://www.asd.k12.ak.us/School_Board/Policy/800policy.html#823.5)). We do not share, disclose or sell email addresses to other organizations.
>> 
>> Please also keep in mind that email is not necessarily secure against third party interception. If your communication is very sensitive or includes personal information, you may want to contact us by postal mail or telephone instead.
> 
> Forms
>
>> If you use one of our public comment forms your name, contact information, and comments may be subject to public disclosure. They will be considered written communication and could be released subject to the guidelines outlined in [School Board Policy 823.51 "Availability of Records."](http://www.asd.k12.ak.us/School_Board/Policy/800policy.html#823.5)
>> 
>> Phone numbers and emails collected through these forms are used only by members of the board and school district employees to respond to your comments. We do not share, disclose or sell email addresses or phone numbers to other organizations.

Rules for Sending Comments
