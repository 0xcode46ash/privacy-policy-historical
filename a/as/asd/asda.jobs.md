# ASDA Careers: Privacy

This privacy statement sets out how ASDA Stores Limited (a company registered in England and Wales under company number 464777) (the operator of this web site) complies with UK data protection law. This applies to your use of the recruitment services on ASDA.com. ASDA may update this privacy statement and so you should check it from time to time before you submit an application to us to make sure that you are happy with any changes that may have been made. This privacy statement was last updated on 13 May 2008.

## Privacy

Your privacy is really important to us, and we understand how important it is to you. Our aim is to be as clear and open as possible about what we do and why we do it. If you apply for a position using the online recruitment services, ASDA Stores Limited will use the information you provide for the recruitment purposes outlined in this privacy statement. We measure the success of everything we do against our privacy principles - that your information will always be:

Used for limited purposes: We won't use your details to contact you with alternative employment opportunities unless you want us to. We give you the opportunity to let us know if you want us to use your details for these purposes at the time that you provide your details to us.

Secure: Information about you will be kept safe and secure. In order to prevent unauthorised access or disclosure we have put in place suitable physical, electronic and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online. We use encryption when collecting or transferring sensitive data.

Necessary: We only collect information that we can use to provide the recruitment services and we will not keep the information you provide to us for longer than is reasonable.

Our last comment on privacy is to assure you that we continually review our practices to make sure we back up our principles above with real actions - not just words.

### What Information do we collect and what do we use it for?

You can have a look through our recruitment site without giving us any personal information about yourself.

If you decide to apply for a position via the site we will need:

  * Name, address and postcode - without this we would not know where to send recruitment information.
  * E-mail address - we send a confirmation of your application via email. We may use e-mail or telephone to advise you of similar alternative vacancies if you have given us permission to do so. We may also contact you by e-mail if you have only partially completed an application. Rest assured, we won't bombard you with boring emails!
  * Telephone numbers for day and evening - if there are any problems with your application or we need to clarify anything with you, we need to be able to contact you quickly. Again, we won't pester you.
  * User name and password - this is to keep your information secure and so that you can return to a partially completed application at a later date.
  * Your CV or application – this is required so that we may asses your skills and employment history. You should only provide the information required by our CV or application template. This template includes a question about any adjustments that may be required should you be invited for interview/assessment centre. Any information you provide about a disability is sensitive personal data. We will only use this information for the purposes of making any necessary adjustments if you are invited for interview/assessment centre, and for monitoring purposes.
  * Criminal Records Checks – Some roles may require us to enquire about previous criminal convictions or carry out criminal records checks. If this is necessary we will make you aware of this as early in the recruitment process as possible.
  * Other information specified during the online application process that is relevant to recruitment.



This information will be used to:

  * Process your application;
  * Consider you for the position for which you have applied, and subsequent suitable vacancies where you have opted for this;
  * Fulfil any legal obligations with which ASDA must abide;
  * Internal record keeping;
  * Provide general aggregate information (which does not identify individuals) and statistics to help ASDA develop its website and services;
  * Make up part of your personnel records if your application is successful (but only to the extent that such information is relevant to your on-going employment);
  * Approach your nominated referees for the purposes of obtaining references.



Please note that we may use service providers to process your information on our behalf but only for the purposes outlined above.

It is your responsibility to ensure that all of the information you provide is true and is not misleading, deceptive or inaccurate in any way. If you believe any of the information ASDA holds about you is incorrect, please contact us on [my-info@asda.co.uk](mailto:my-info@asda.co.uk) and we will happily amend this for you.

Where you provide information about somebody else, for example, your referees, you should ensure that they have given their consent.

### IP addresses

When you visit our site, we will automatically receive your IP address, a unique identifier for your computer or other access device. We do not use your IP address to identify you.

### Cookies

We will also store information obtained about you automatically from cookies (small text files which are sent by us or our external web host to your computer). We use cookies to:

  * greet you personally and speed up your log-in when you come back to the site; and
  * measure response to advertising and to keep track of the number of visitors to our site.



The information collected via cookies can be used to personalise and improve our service to you, for example, to make it quicker to get to the parts of the website that you want to get to.

If you want to delete any cookies that are already on your computer, please refer to the instructions for your file management software to locate the file or directory that stores cookies. Our cookies will have the file names username@www.asda.jobs

### Equal Opportunities

Our full Equal Opportunities policy can be viewed on ASDA.com. As part of the Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act 2006 we are required to make basic documentation checks on every candidate. Please note that you will be asked to provide documentation of your eligibility to work in the UK if you are invited to attend the next stage of the recruitment process with us.

Other information, for example, relating to your sex, ethnic origin and culture is requested for the purpose of monitoring the effectiveness of our Equal Opportunities policy. This information is requested purely for monitoring purposes.

### Your rights and removal of your Information

If at any time after the submission of your application you become unavailable to work, or if you simply change your mind, please e-mail us on [my-info@asda.co.uk](mailto:my-info@asda.co.uk) and we will withdraw your application. In addition, if you have partially completed an application, but it is not submitted within a reasonable period, it may cease to be stored. [Note: Please confirm correct email address].

You have a right to access the personal data held about you. To obtain a copy of the personal data we hold about you, please contact us at [my-info@asda.co.uk](mailto:my-info@asda.co.uk).

### Security

We take your security very seriously and have gone to great lengths to ensure that your use of the recruitment service online is secure:

Your personal information can only be viewed on-line if you successfully log-in to our systems. Our log-in procedure minimises the risk of someone who is not the applicant doing this.

Our internal systems and networks are among the best in the world - our investment in this infrastructure is to your benefit as it helps to prevent the risk of unauthorised people gaining access to our systems.
