**1\. What Information is collected and for what purposes?**  
We collect personal data from you in a variety of ways including when you register with us on the website. We categorize the personal data in two types of information: personally identifiable information ("PII") and non-personally identifiable information ("Non-PII"), which is also referred to as aggregate and anonymous data. Some of the collected data may concern health, ethnicity, sex life or other information which may be considered as sensitive.

The following personal data is collected on our website.

(i) In order to establish an Ad Profile on the website we require that you submit, User name/pseudonym, postal code & country, date of birth, current marital status or relationship, desired length of a relationship, height, weight, build/stature, sex and email address. This data is collected in order to identify suitable members and put them in touch with you as well as to improve our Site and Service. For this purpose, data is made anonymous, i.e. it is only sent to potentially interested members using your pseudonym. You yourself decide what information appears in your profile. Personal information that may identify you is not permitted on your Ad Profile. Please note that you may upload photos to your Ad Profile. The type of photos you upload may clearly identify you. The data is also collected for commercial, promotional, advertising and business purposes;

(ii) When you order credits we and/or our third party affiliates and payment processors, process financial information required for the payment transaction, such as name, address and your credit card data (such as number, issuing institution and expiry date) or account details (account holder, account number, sort code, institution), and

(iii) Information set out under section 2 below.

**2\. What information do you gather automatically from visitors?**  
We use your IP address (the series of numbers associated with your individual computer) to help us maintain our site, identify problems with our server and to provide you with an enhanced experience. We do use cookies to identify traffic that comes through advertising and to facilitate a more user friendly experience. Cookies are small pieces of information that a web site places on your computer's hard drive so we know it's you when you visit. This helps us to create a personalized experience for you when you visit our site. The use of cookies is a very common practice on the Internet and provides for a more customized user experience of the Website. If you are uncomfortable with this, you can disable all cookies through your browser settings. However, should you choose to disable all cookies, this will impact and/or prevent your ability to access and use the Service.

**3\. How will this information be used and who has access to it?**  
**Non-PII**  
Your Non-PII is used to personalize your experience, allow other members to find you through a search, to compose your personal profile - which is associated with a pseudonymous identity you have created - and to deliver targeted advertising and promotional offers to you from external companies that are of the highest relevance to your demographic profile. We may share some of this information for our own analysis and research purposes with our professional advisors or consultants and third party partners.

**PII**  
The PII we collect from you is used in the course of providing our service to you and to improve the content and functionality of our Website or customize the layout of our pages for each individual member. We may use your contact information to send you valuable updates and timely notices of promotions and mailbox status reports.

**Trusted Third-Parties**  
We may share personal data, PII as well as Non-PII, with service providers that may be associated with us to perform functions on our behalf. In addition, unless you opt out, from time to time we may share and/or sell PII about our users (such as your mailing or email addresses) with selected third parties, so they can offer goods and services that we believe may be of interest or benefit to our users. We will ensure that such third party's processing of your personal data will not be incompatible with the purposes stated in this document. If you prefer not to receive messages from these third parties you may notify us by opting out at any time by going to the "Manage Profile" or "Message Center" sections of your Ad Profile as described more fully below or sending a request to our Contact Form below.

We would require that these third parties sign non-disclosure and, if necessary, data protection agreements and would endeavor to disclose as little PII as possible. Should such a combination then in fact occur, you should expect that we would share some or all of your information in order to continue to provide the Service.
