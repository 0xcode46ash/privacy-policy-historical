**Anonymous Usage Logs**  
The Site’s web servers collect anonymous logs during user visits to the Site.  This information is used to create aggregate statistics about the operation and use of the Site such as when our Site is accessed, the pages which refer visitors to the Site, the type of web browsers visitors use and which pages of the Site are viewed.  These statistics help us understand how the Site is used and provide us with valuable information for improving the Site in the future.  From time to time, we may share such aggregate, non-personally identifiable statistical information with our partners, affiliates, consultants, suppliers and providers. The type and amount of information we receive and store depends on how you use the Site.

**Personal Information**  
In general, when you visit our Site you remain anonymous, but on some pages, you need to provide Personal Information to register, make donations, contact us or conduct other transactions via the Site. The types of Personal Information collected on the Site may include any or all of the following, depending on your activities on the Site: name, address, e-mail address, phone number, website, organization (including the organization’s name, website, phone number, and address), username, password, languages, fields of work, Twitter handle, photograph and other Personal Information that you actively provide to us via the Site.

The Site also enables you to send a message related to the Site to other people, for example to introduce friends who you believe may be interested in learning about Ashoka and who have consented to receiving such messages. To utilize this functionality, you will need to provide personally identifiable information, such as name and email address for people other than yourself. Ashoka does not actively collect or store this personal information and only uses it so far as it is required to provide the service.

**Use of Personal Information**  
We use and/or disclose Personal Information to process and complete donations and to provide information about our organization, initiatives or other issues of interest. 

Except as provided herein, we will not sell any Personal Information that you provide through the Site without your prior written consent. We may use Personal Information that you provide to update you on our activities and to let you and those you identify know about new projects that we believe may be of interest to you except as otherwise required by local law.   


We may share Personal Information with our partners, affiliates, consultants, local curators and providers. Our agreements with these entities require that they keep your Personal Information confidential and only use your Personal Information to the extent necessary to perform their functions and not for any other purpose.  We also contract other companies and individuals (collectively “Suppliers”) to perform functions on our behalf, including without limitation, processing credit card payments or sending communications to you. We will take reasonable steps to ensure that these Suppliers keep your Personal Information confidential and only use your Personal Information to the extent necessary to perform their functions and not for any other purpose.

Donations that are made to Ashoka on the Site are processed using a third-party payment system. Credit/Debit card details will be retained by the party providing the payment services and its affiliated bank as deemed necessary by them to process the payment for your donation. Your Credit/Debit card details will be retained by the processor for future transactions only upon your authorization. If you later decide that you do not want such information stored, you may contact us at [web@ashoka.org](mailto:web@ashoka.org) and we will coordinate with the processor to remove such information.

We may disclose Personal Information in response to legal process or when we believe in good faith that the law requires it, for example, in response to a court order, subpoena or a law enforcement agency’s request. To the extent allowable under local law, we also reserve the right to disclose Personal Information to protect the security of the Site, to protect ourselves and our affiliated non-profits against liability, and/or in connection with any sale, assignment, or other transfer of some or all of our operations.

In the event that Ashoka or a significant portion of the Site or Ashoka’s assets or business is sold, assigned, merged, or otherwise transferred, Ashoka may transfer your Personal Information as a part of the transaction. In the event such a transfer occurs, Ashoka will comply with applicable local laws related to your Personal Information and otherwise use reasonable efforts to keep your Personal Information subject to the same protection as it was prior to the transfer. In the event that your Personal Information becomes subject to a different privacy policy, Ashoka will comply with applicable local laws and otherwise use reasonable efforts to notify you of such change.

The Site is not directed to children and Ashoka does not knowingly solicit information from any child under the age of 13. If you are under the age of 13, you may not use the Site to disclose Personal Information or use any feature of the Site that requires such disclosures.

**How You Can Access or Correct Your Information**  
If you are a registered user, you can access, correct and remove certain Personal Information that we collect online and maintain by logging into your account. If any errors in your Personal Information cannot be corrected by accessing your account, or if you do not have an account, or if you have other questions related to updating or changing your Personal Information on the Site, please contact us using the contact information below. You may also contact us using the information below to ask us to terminate your account and/or remove your Personal Information from our records, electronic or otherwise.  However, we will need to maintain certain Personal Information about your donations in our records for purposes such as tax notifications and disclosures. 

**Links**  
Please note that third parties may also collect information about you, through cookies or other technologies, when you link to their websites through the Site.  We do not monitor or control the information collection or privacy practices of these or any other third parties, and are not responsible for their practices or the content of their websites.   If you are concerned about how third parties collect and use information, please review their privacy practices posted on their websites.

**Changes to Ashoka Privacy Policy**  
Our privacy practices, like the online medium itself, are subject to change.  Ashoka may, in its sole discretion, change this Privacy Policy at any time to reflect changes in the way we collect and use Personal Information in the future.  Please check this Privacy Policy frequently and particularly before you submit additional Personal Information via the Site. Revisions to this Privacy Policy will be posted on the Site via a link from the home page of the Site.  Registered users will receive notifications providing information related to modifications. Your continued use of our Site after changes in this Privacy Policy will mean that you accept such changes except as otherwise required by local law. 

**Security**  
Ashoka strives to protect the sensitive information visitors submit and encrypts some information, such as credit card transactions, using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and transport layer security (TLS) technology. By encrypting your sensitive data, SSL and TLS attempt to prevent anyone from reading it as it travels across the Internet. You should note, however, that no transmission of encrypted data is completely secure and should be aware of the risks before submitting sensitive information. If you are concerned about using your credit card to make a donation online, please feel free to call us at 703-527-8300 and make your donation via phone. 

**International Users**  
Ashoka seeks to collect, process, store, disclose and dispose of Personal Information that you submit to us in accordance with applicable law in the jurisdictions where it collects information. Please note that the Personal Information you submit to the Site will be transferred to the United States to be processed by Ashoka in order to provide the Site and its services to you or for such other purposes as set forth in this Privacy Policy under the “Use of Information” section above. If you are not a resident of the United States, you acknowledge and agree that we may collect and use your Personal Information, as discussed in this Privacy Policy, outside your resident jurisdiction.

In addition, we may store such Personal Information in the United States or other jurisdictions, outside your resident jurisdiction. In particular, you are advised that the United States uses a sectoral model of privacy protection that relies on a mix of legislation, governmental regulation, and self-regulation. Please be aware that United States law may offer different levels of protection for Personal Information than may be available in your country.

**Residents of California**  
California residents are entitled by law to request an Information Sharing Disclosure. Following your provision of notice to the address below, Ashoka will provide you with a notice of your right to prevent sharing of your Personal Information as well as a cost-free means of doing so. To receive such a notice, submit a written request to the address below, specifying that you are requesting your “California Customer Choice Notice.”

**Compliance with Anti-Money Laundering Laws**  
Ashoka complies with the United States Office of Foreign Assets Control regulations as well as United States export control and anti-money laundering laws. All grants will be awarded subject to compliance with such laws. Ashoka will not make any grant if it finds that to do so would be unlawful. This may prohibit awards in certain countries and/or to certain individuals or entities.
