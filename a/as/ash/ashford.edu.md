# Ashford University â€“ Privacy Policy

### Ashford University Privacy Policy

At Ashford University, we take your personal privacy seriously. This document describes the categories of information we gather via the website and for what purpose, outlines how that information may be shared with others, and identifies the categories of persons with whom it may be shared. By registering with Ashford University or by using the Ashford University Site, you accept and agree to this Privacy Policy and the [Ashford University Terms and Conditions of Usage](https://web.archive.org/web/20101226023154id_/http://ashford.edu/privacy/terms.php).

This Privacy Policy applies to the Internet website of Ashford University at www.ashford.edu. This Privacy Policy also applies to other affiliated websites that are owned by Ashford University and made available to students in the matriculation process and after they have enrolled with Ashford University. All such sites will be collectively referred to in this Privacy Policy as the "Ashford University Site" or "Site". 

This Privacy Policy does not apply to information collected at any site that is not owned by Ashford University, including any website reached through a link on any Ashford University Site. By way of example only, a link on Ashford University Site takes a viewer to an online bookstore that is owned and operated by EdMap, not Ashford University. The name and logo of Ashford University may appear on that online bookstore website in order to notify students that the bookstore sells certain materials specified for Ashford University's curriculum. Ashford University does not have access to information collected through that online bookstore. This Privacy Policy does not apply to information collected through that online bookstore. The privacy policy for the EdMap online bookstore can be accessed by clicking [here](http://www.edmapbookstore.com/storefront/showHelpTopic/ASHSP/7).

### Effective date

### What is Ashford University's practice regarding cookies?

Your browser software has a feature called a 'cookie' that stores small amounts of data on your computer about your visit to certain websites. As a user of browser software, you may elect to disable this feature, although doing so may prevent you from using certain features that require cookies. Cookies placed on your computer by Ashford University don't tell Ashford any personally identifiable information about you but instead provide anonymous information that permits Ashford University to track how users navigate our pages, when users return to our sites, and which features are the most popular. 

### What other information does Ashford University collect on this site? 

Like many commercial websites, Ashford University servers monitor and log all web traffic on the Site. These logs contain the IP address and URL from the site you visited just before you visited, the URL of the page you visit upon leaving the Site, if any, and the type of browser and operating system you are using. Statistical information is collected about visitor traffic patterns in order to improve the quality, functionality and usefulness of the Site to our customers. In such cases, the system has no means to identify you personally. We may also create and maintain records of anonymous data collected from cookies and anonymous demographic information that has been aggregated from multiple personally identifiable records such that it is no longer personally identifiable with a particular person (such as aggregate number of inquiries from a particular city, state or zip code). We may share all of the anonymous data described above with our contractors and consultants, other educational institutions, and unaffiliated third parties such as analysts, reporters, governmental authorities and others. 

### How does Ashford University protect personal information? 

Although we cannot guarantee against any loss, misuse, unauthorized disclosure, alternation or destruction of data, we try to prevent such occurrences. Our servers and databases are protected by firewalls and passwords. In addition, we use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software to encrypt data as it travels between your computer and our servers. 

### Children

We do not ever knowingly collect information from children under the age of 18, nor is this Site designed to provide any service to children under the age of 18. If you are under 18, please do not give us any personal information. If you have reason to believe that a child has provided personal information to us, please contact us and we will attempt to remove that information from our databases.
