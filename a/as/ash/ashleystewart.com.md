**Security**

Ashley Stewart believes in providing a safe and secure experience for all of our online visitors.

In addition, we hold our employees responsible for upholding our privacy standards.

We maintain reasonable physical and electronic safeguards designed to limit unauthorized access to your personally identifiable information, and to protect you against the criminal misuse of that information.

We use data encryption technology when transferring and receiving your personal information. For example, in your transactions submitted by you through the Website, a solid key icon or a locked padlock icon at the lower portion of your Web browser window confirms the site is secured through Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). Pages requesting personal information should always have one of these icons. You can also confirm your data is being encrypted by looking at the URL line of your browser (the place where you type Website addresses). When accessing a secure server, the site address will change from "http" to "https".

While we use the foregoing security measures to protect your information, please note that no data transmitted over the Internet or stored and utilized for business purposes can be guaranteed to be completely secure.  No security measures are perfect or impenetrable.  We cannot guarantee that only authorized persons will view your information.
