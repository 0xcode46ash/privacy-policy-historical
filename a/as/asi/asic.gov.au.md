#### Your Rights to Privacy 

The [Privacy Act](http://scaleplus.law.gov.au/) (Cth) regulates, among other things, the collection, storage, quality, use and disclosure of personal information. ASIC is subject to the Privacy Act. 

#### Collection of personal information 

Information Privacy Principles 1-3 of the Privacy Act regulate collection of personal information. ASIC may collect information from users of its website in a number of ways. Primarily, that information will be collected by means of the lodgement of forms which are prescribed or approved under the Corporations Law and Corporations Regulations. Information collected may include personal information. 

Information provided by the user will only be collected with the user’s consent as the user must click on a button provided on each web page to submit information to ASIC via its Website. If a user does not wish to provide information to ASIC via ASIC’s Website alternative methods of transmitting the information to ASIC are available. 

When, or before, it collects personal information ASIC will take reasonable steps to inform the user of ASIC’s Website of: 

  * the purposes for which the information is collected; 
  * where applicable, any law that requires the particular information to be collected, and the main consequences for the user if all or part of the information is not provided. 



Clickstream data is collected from the ASIC website. This data enables ASIC to approximate the number of visits to the Website, the pages accessed and documents downloaded. It does not identify users. In some cases, ASIC may wish to carry out a feedback survey. Prior to collecting any survey results it will advise users of the purpose of the survey. As a survey will be a voluntary exercise, there will be a facility to allow users to exit at any time during the survey process. 

#### ASIC’s use and disclosure of information 

Information Privacy Principles 9 and 10 of the Privacy Act regulate the use of personal information. 

Information Privacy Principle 11 of the Privacy Act regulates the disclosure of personal information. 

ASIC will only use and disclose personal information in accordance with the Information Privacy Principles. 

#### Data Security Information 

Privacy Principle 4 of the Privacy Act regulates storage and security of personal information. 

Where appropriate, ASIC’s Website facility provides a secure environment by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). This establishes a session between ASIC’s web server and the user’s browser, and encrypts all traffic between the user’s browser and ASIC’s website. 

#### Access to and Alteration of Records containing Personal Information 

Information Privacy Principles 6 and 7 of the Privacy Act, provide for individuals’ access to and alteration of records containing their personal information. The Freedom of Information Act 1982 (Cth) also sets out the process by which users, whose personal information is held by ASIC, may be allowed to have access to records containing their personal information, and may be allowed to have their records changed or annotated, if necessary. 

#### Data Quality 

Information Privacy Principles 7 and 8 of the Privacy Act regulate data quality. Users should note that when they provide data to ASIC via the internet, ASIC relies on the accuracy of that data. 

#### Complaints 

Users inquiring about their rights, and remedies for breaches of privacy can contact the ASIC Administrative Law Co-ordinator in the regional office in the State or Territory in which the user resides and to the Commonwealth Privacy Commissioner. The Privacy Commissioner’s Hotline is 1800 023 985. The Privacy Commissioner’s Website is <http://www.privacy.gov.au/rights>.
