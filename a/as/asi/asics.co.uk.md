ASICS may from time to time use your personal data to send you automated email messages or marketing materials regarding our products and services and the products or services of third party suppliers, in each case only with your prior consent or when you are an existing customer and the email message concerns similar products or services. These email messages may contain features that help us ensure that you received the message and were able to open the message.

### Tests and measurements

At your request ASICS may measure or test your physique, strength, motion and endurance (e.g. through our 3D foot shape measurement, leg alignment measurement, body composition measurement, leg strength test, running form test and aerobic test). Together with other information you have provided to us, we analyse the results of these tests and measurements to advise you, for example on how to improve your running ability, boost your performance or what shoes or clothing are most suitable for you.

### Disclosing your personal data

As a general rule, we do not share your personal data with anyone outside ASICS. However, we may share your personal data with trusted third parties that perform business functions (e.g. hosting of our websites, analyzing data or performing audits) or provide services on our behalf (e.g. support services). All such third parties will be required to adequately safeguard your personal data and only process it in accordance with our instructions.

Sometimes ASICS offers you a service or organizes an event in a joint marketing effort with other companies. In such cases, your personal data will be shared with these companies. We will always let you know that such relationship exists and who these companies are prior to your registration. Note that these companies often have their own privacy policies that apply to the way they use your personal data. These privacy policies sometimes differ from the ASICS privacy policy. We may also disclose your personal data if disclosure is required by law.

### (International) transfers of your personal data

ASICS may transfer and process any personal data you provide to us to countries outside the European Economic Area whose laws may not afford the same level of protection to your personal data. ASICS will therefore ensure that all adequate safeguards are in place and that all applicable laws and regulations are complied with in connection with such transfer.
