# Privacy Policy

**Our privacy policy is described below, in an effort to provide your company with an understanding of how information provided to ASI will be used. If our policy should change, we will list the changed policy on this site.**

ASI publishes in print and electronic formats business information provided by its members to listed members of ASI and other entities that offer products and services.

**Security**  
Your payment and personal information are always safe. The information you provide to an ASIcentral.com Web site covered by this policy is protected in transit by using a network protocol called Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). SSL is the industry standard technology for secure online transactions. A simple way to know your transmission is protected is by referencing the URL. If it starts with https://, you can be assured that it is using SSL. Transactions are processed only from secure browsers. These browsers encrypt the information sent using SSL, which scrambles the data to make it extremely difficult for anyone who intercepts the information to read it.

REMINDER: In the event of an unauthorized use of your credit or debit card, you must promptly notify the card issuer pursuant to its reporting rules and procedures.

**Safeguarding Information**  
The protection of your personal information is important to ASIcentral.com, and as a result, we do not accept payment via email. [ASICentral.com](http://asicentral.com/) protects against unauthorized disclosures by limiting access only to our employees who need the information to do their jobs.
