_As of August 2009_

At American Savings Bank F.S.B. ("American," "we," "us," "our"), protecting the privacy and confidentiality of your Personal Information is important. We value your business and the trust you have placed in American to provide a safe and secure environment for personally identifiable financial information, which we will call in this Privacy Policy your "Personal Information."1

It is our policy that all your Personal Information will be held in strictest confidence. To help you better understand how we protect your Personal Information, we are providing you with this Privacy Policy describing our practices and policies with respect to your Personal Information.

### Information We Collect

We collect, maintain, and use information about you on a routine basis in order to offer you the financial services and products you obtain from us and to provide superior customer service. We use all of your Personal Information we collect for specific business purposes such as administering and servicing your accounts, complying with state/federal banking regulations, protecting against fraud, and developing a better understanding of your financial needs to provide you with improved products and services. We collect Personal Information about you from the following three sources:

  1. Applications and other forms we receive from you;
  2. Your transactions with us, our affiliates2, or others; and
  3. Consumer reporting agencies.



### Sharing Personal Information with Third Parties

We do not disclose Personal Information about our current or former customers to any affiliate or nonaffiliated third party except as permitted or required by law. We may disclose all of the Personal Information about you that we collect, as described above, with third parties for the purpose of servicing your loan and deposit accounts with us such as printing your checks, mailing your account statements, obtaining credit or check verifications, processing insurance applications and servicing insurance accounts for products offered through us, servicing a brokerage account, processing an insurance claim, and/or processing transactions that you have requested or authorized. We may share your Personal Information with third parties who conduct marketing services on our behalf and other financial institutions with which we have joint marketing agreements, such as UVEST Financial Services Group, Inc.
