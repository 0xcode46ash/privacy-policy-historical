# ASQ: About: ASQ's Privacy Policy

**Introduction**

The American Society For Quality, Inc. (ASQ), the owner of www.asq.org is strongly committed to protecting the privacy of its members, customers and visitors. This privacy policy describes what information ASQ will collect from visitors and purchasers such as yourself, and how we will use that information once it’s collected. This policy does not apply to the practices of any third party, affiliate, or business partner that ASQ does not own or control. 

**What Web sites does this policy apply to?**

This privacy policy applies to ASQ's Web site, www.asq.org. It does not apply to Web sites of any ASQ member, affiliate, section, division, or chapter. It does not apply to Web sites operated by organizations or groups who associate themselves in any way with ASQ. It does not apply to any other Web sites, including those which have hypertext links to the ASQ Web site. 

**Collection of non-personal data**

If you browse ASQ's Web site and you are not an ASQ member, you do so anonymously. We do not collect your e-mail address or other personal information. We do log your IP address (the Internet address of your computer) to tell us which parts of our Web site you visit and how long you spend there. We do not link your IP address to anything personally identifiable. We also track what country you are accessing the Internet from, and what time and date you visited. 

The only other information automatically provided to us is the type of computer, operating system and Web browser you are using: Your browser supplies us with this information. We use this information from our server logs to learn more about our visitors as a group, not about you as an individual. The information helps us identify overall usage patterns and trends on the site. 

If you are an ASQ member and log in, we will also collect your first and last name, your membership type, which forums/divisions you are a member of and which publications you are signed up to receive. We do this by placing a small bit of data called a “cookie” on your computer (see more about cookies below). Collecting this information helps us direct you to the information on our Web site that’s meant for you. 

**Collection of your personal information**

Online forms are available for customers to request information, products, and services. We obtain information you provide to us via these forms, as well as surveys and contests, such as your name, mailing address and e-mail address. We may use this information to provide you with information about the products and services offered by ASQ. In addition, this site uses registration forms for customers to register for courses, conferences, and/or certification exams. We collect information about you only if you voluntarily provide contact information within these forms. 

**Control of your personal information**

ASQ will not sell or share your e-mail address with other organizations. However, other information you share may be used to provide you with information from ASQ or selected organizations about products, services or activities that may be of interest to you. To receive this information you must “opt in” to receive it when you provide personal information on our Web site. 

We occasionally hire other companies to provide limited services on our behalf, including electronic newsletter delivery and the processing of event registrations. We will only provide those companies with the information they need to deliver the service, and they are prohibited from using that information for any other purpose. 

If you supply your personal information to an ASQ partner, such as within the ASQ e-Learning Center or the Career Services area, please be aware that ASQ no longer has control over the use of your personal information. We will not knowingly partner with companies that abuse personal information. However, be aware that our partner companies may contact you if you choose to conduct business with them. 

**Disclosure of your personal information**

ASQ may disclose your personal information if required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) satisfy a legal order or comply with legal process; (b) defend the rights of ASQ or its affiliates or business partners; or (c) protect the personal safety of ASQ employees, agents, affiliates, business partners, customers or Web site users. 

**Access to your personal information**

If you are an ASQ member, you can review and edit your personal information in the "My ASQ" area.  Sign in with your member number and password, and click on the Home tab.

Within “My ASQ” you can:

  * Change your e-mail address.

Some services offered on ASQ.org collect information that is not accessible via “My ASQ.” In such cases, you can access your personal information by contacting ASQ as described in the [Contact Us ](https://web.archive.org/contact-asq.html)section of the Web site. For example, if you wish to change your ASQ Section membership, you can review and edit your personal information by contacting one of our Customer Care representatives at 800-248-1946 or 414-272-8575.

**Cookies**

**What is a cookie?**

A cookie is a tiny piece of information that a Web site stores on your computer during your visit. When you revisit the Web site, your browser sends this bit of information back to the site. Cookies allow Web sites to maintain information on a particular user. For example, an online bookstore might use a cookie to identify you so it can store the contents of your shopping cart. Most Web browsers can be configured to notify you when cookies arrive and can either ask your approval to accept them, or they can be set to refuse cookies outright. Most browsers also can let you delete cookies you may have accepted in the past. 

**ASQ cookies**

ASQ uses cookies to help guide members through our Web site (as described above) and to keep track of your shopping carts: A unique ID is assigned to each shopping session. Our Web server sends the shopping cart ID to your computer. If your browser is configured to accept cookies, the unique ID is stored on your computer and sent back to our Web server. This unique ID is retrieved and used by the server to keep track of the contents of your shopping cart, which is stored on our server. 

At the present time, ASQ cookies will be deleted automatically when you quit the browser, unless you are a member and check the “remember me on this Web site” box when you sign up. This may change in the future as ASQ strives to personalize your Web experience with us. The ASQ Web site cookie will not damage your system or files in any way. 

**Your credit card information**

We collect credit card information, such as your card number and card expiration date, when you purchase products on our site. We will not voluntarily disclose your credit card information without your consent. 

**Security**

This site has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control.  We use a secure server to transmit sensitive data to and from our site. All data (including your credit card information) transmitted through our secure Web server is encrypted so no one else can read it. 

**Use of e-mail forwarding tools**

If you send an e-mail via our Web site using the services called "e-mail this to a friend" or "forward this conversation to a friend," we do not use the e-mail address for any purpose other than to send your e-mail. We do not rent or sell these e-mail addresses. We generally discard the e-mail addresses some time after they have been used to send your e-mail.  You do not have permission to use these e-mail services to send spam. 

**ASQ privacy policy changes**

If we decide to change our privacy policy for www.asq.org, we will post the modifications so that you will always know what information we gather, how we might use that information, and whether we will disclose it to anyone.
