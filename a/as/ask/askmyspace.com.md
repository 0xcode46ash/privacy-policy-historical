## The Full Detailed Privacy Policy

  1. Who We Are

Welcome to Myspace, the social entertainment platform for creators to broadcast their content, connect with other creators and with fans, and grow their fan base, through the creation of Profiles and connections on the Myspace Services. Members are able to use their Profiles and the Myspace Services platform(s) to interact with their favorite entertainers, discover new music and videos, express themselves, communicate with old and new friends, and share information and content. Myspace services include: (i) any Myspace-branded URL, including [new.myspace.com](https://new.myspace.com/) (the " **Myspace Website** "); (ii) Myspace messaging services (e.g., instant messaging, private messaging, public and private group chatting, etc.); (iii) Myspace music and video services, such as the Myspace TV-branded video service (" **Myspace TV™** ); (iv) Myspace developer services; (v) Myspace mobile services; (vi) Myspace advertising services; and (vii) any other features, content, or applications offered or operated from time to time by Myspace in connection with Myspace's business, including when Myspace is accessed via the internet, mobile device, television or other electronic device (collectively, " **Myspace Services** "). This Policy applies to the Myspace Services except where a different privacy policy is posted (e.g., the classic service at www.myspace.com and related classic mobile applications), in which case the posted policy applies. The Myspace Services are hosted in the United States.

  2. Scope Of This Policy

This Policy describes generally how we collect, use, store and share information that we receive from users of Myspace Services (" **Users** "). This Policy applies both to individuals using such services who register with Myspace and create Myspace Accounts and their associated Profile(s) (" **Members** "), as well as individuals who use such Myspace Services without registering (" **Visitors** ").

This Policy covers the activities of Myspace with respect to the collection, use, storage and disclosure of information through any of the Myspace Services that contain a link to this Policy. The activities of third parties or affiliated companies that provide services or advertising to Myspace, or that you link to from us, or that may collect information about you themselves or that we may share your information with, including our affiliates such as Specific Media LLC (" **Specific Media** "), are governed by the respective privacy policies of those third parties or affiliated companies, not this Policy.

Please note that this Policy does not limit Myspace's use or sharing of aggregated, de-identified or other anonymized information that does not constitute Personal Information (as defined below). We may use and/or share such information in any manner not otherwise prohibited by this Policy, without notice or compensation to you, including freely disclosing non-Personal Information to Specific Media, advertisers, partners, content owners, and other third parties.

We will continue to evaluate and update this Policy as we rollout additional services for our Users, employ new technologies and otherwise adapt and improve along with the evolving online and digital world so we recommend that you check for changes regularly. We welcome your comments, as we strive to maintain a Policy that is both transparent and that improves the Myspace Services.

To the extent that we provide you notice on any of the Myspace Services of different or additional privacy policies or practices _(e.g._ , at the point of our collection), those additional terms shall govern such data collection and use.

In addition, please review Myspace Services' [Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/web/20130116033711id_/http%3A//new.myspace.com/pages/terms), which governs your use of Myspace Services. **_By using the Myspace Services, you consent to our Policy and Terms of Use and our collection, use, storage and sharing of your information and data, and other activities, as described in this Policy._**

  3. The Information That We Collect
    1. Information You Provide To Us

**Personal Information And Demographic Information**

We may ask you to provide us with certain information when you interact with the Myspace Services. This information can generally be grouped into two main categories - Personal Information and Demographic Information.

Information that identifies you as a particular individual is referred to in this Policy as " **Personal Information**." This would include your full name, e-mail address, telephone number and street address. Please note that the term Personal Information does NOT include Myspace IDs or Device Identifiers (as such terms are defined below), except to the extent that they are combined with other forms of Personal Information that we have collected directly from you on the Myspace Services. The term " **Demographic Information** " refers to information about groups or particular types of individuals that access the Myspace Services. Demographic Information does not directly identify you as a specific individual, and would include information such as your age, gender, marital status, income level, and zip code.

We typically collect Personal Information and Demographic Information through the Myspace Services when you choose to provide us with such information. For example, if you decide to become a Member, you must complete a registration form and submit certain Registration Information (as defined below) to Myspace. We may also collect Personal Information and/or Demographic Information through a variety of other methods, including when you elect to contact us, submit Profile Content (as defined below), or otherwise interact with the Myspace Services.

      * **Registration Information**

Certain features of the Myspace Services are only accessible by Members who have registered with Myspace and created a Myspace account (" **Account** "). In order to do so, you must first complete a registration form that requests certain basic registration information from you, such as your full name, e-mail address, date of birth, and gender (collectively, " **Registration Information** "). Please note that the Registration Information requested by Myspace may include both Personal Information and Demographic Information.

When you create an Account, you will be asked to select a username and password. It is your responsibility to maintain the confidentiality of your password, and you may change your password. You are responsible for all uses of your password, whether or not such use has been authorized by you.

Except as may otherwise be authorized in this Policy, or the Myspace Services' [Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/web/20130116033711id_/http%3A//new.myspace.com/pages/terms), you are also responsible for ensuring that any information you provide to Myspace (including Registration Information) is true, accurate, and complete in all respects.

      * **Profile Content**

If you decide to become a Member, you will also create one or more Myspace profiles that are associated with your Account (each, a " **Profile** "). Myspace may allow you to populate your Profile with certain content, and we may also associate certain additional content with your Profile based on your interactions with the Myspace Services, such as your video viewing and other related activities (collectively, " **Profile Content** "). Any Profile Content that Myspace allows you to submit must comply with the restrictions set forth in our [Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/web/20130116033711id_/http%3A//new.myspace.com/pages/terms) at all times. Please note that your Profile Content may contain Registration Information.

The information in your Profile Content is grouped into two main categories – Public Information and Restricted Information.

**"Public Information"** refers to the portion of your Profile Content that can always be viewed, accessed, and used by anyone with access to the Myspace Services ( _e.g._ , Myspace, other Users, search engines, advertisers, application developers, other third parties, etc.). Any Profile Content that does not otherwise constitute Restricted Information (as defined below) is considered Public Information for the purposes of this Policy. At a minimum, Public Information includes your:

      * Full Name
      * Username
      * Profile URL
      * About Me (the portion of your Profile that provides a place to describe yourself)
      * Profile Photo
      * Profile Cover
      * Stated Location
      * Gender
      * Age
      * Myspace IDs

**Public Information also includes:**

      * Any additional Profile Content associated with a " **Public Profile** ," which refers to any Profile for which a User has set the Profile's visibility status to "Public" in his or her Profile Settings (as defined below); 
      * Activity Notifications (as defined below) published on the Myspace Services from Public Profiles;
      * Your status as a "Top Fan" (as defined below);
      * Affinity Information (as defined below); and
      * The number of your connections in and connections out.

By contrast, " **Restricted Information** " refers to those portions of the Profile Content and Activity Notifications (as defined below) associated with your Profile to which you may elect to restrict access by changing the Profile settings that Myspace may make available to you from time-to-time [here](https://web.archive.org/settings/profile) (" **Profile Settings** "). These Profile Settings may permit you to create a " **Restricted Profile** " by choosing to enable certain (but not absolute) limitations on the availability of certain aspects of your Profile that are not Public Information, certain associated Profile Content, and some of the notifications that Myspace produces regarding your activities (" **Activity Notifications** "). Further, unless otherwise provided by Myspace, all of your Profile Content and Activity Notifications will still be available to the Profiles that you allow to connect to you. Please note you are currently unable to restrict access to Public Information, which can always be viewed, accessed, and used by anyone with access to the Myspace Services, including via third party search engines.

Although access to Restricted Information will be limited as set forth above, it is important to note that if you share such information with others, they may copy that information or share it with others, including with the public. Myspace is not responsible for the actions of those with whom you choose to share your Restricted Information. For example, you may choose to use the Myspace Services to access " **Object Pages** ," which are those pages that, for example, represent an individual item of content such as video or audio, or a collection of content such as audio tracks ( _i.e._ , "mixes") (each, an " **Object** "). When you decide to post content, comments, or other materials to another Member's Profile, an Object Page, or elsewhere on the Myspace Services, that information will be disclosed, and available to third parties consistent with the visibility settings for the relevant Profile or Object, **even if those settings are inconsistent with your own Profile Settings**. Object Pages are generally publicly available, which means that posts that you make on those pages will likely be available to anyone. In addition, your video viewing or audio selections may be part of your Profile Content as well as any Object Pages that you view. Similarly, if you connect to a Public Profile, the fact that you have connected to that Public Profile will be available to anybody with access to the Myspace Services.

The Profile Settings that Myspace makes available to Members, as well as their functionality, may change as the Myspace Services continue to evolve. We will provide reasonable advance notice of the changes in the Profile Settings section, or otherwise. Delays and errors in effecting Profile Setting preferences may occur and we do not represent that they will be immediate, complete, error-free, current, reliable or accurate. If you experience any problems with your Profile Settings, or have any questions or concerns regarding your Profile Settings, or you are interested in obtaining additional information regarding the settings options that may be available to you, please contact us at the [Help Site](https://web.archive.org/help).

You should be aware that the default setting for Profiles of Members who indicate that they are 18 years of age or older is public ( _i.e_ Public Profiles). The default setting for Profiles of Members who indicate that they are under 18 years of age is restricted ( _i.e_ Restricted Profiles), other than for Artist Profiles (as defined in the [Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/web/20130116033711id_/http%3A//new.myspace.com/pages/terms)) of Members who are under 18 years of age, which are public by default. Other than with respect to Artist Profiles whose visibility status may not be changed, you may change the visibility status of your Profile from a Public Profile to a Restricted Profile at any time by visiting [Profile Settings](https://web.archive.org/settings/profile). Please note, however, that Activity Notifications that were created during the time that your Profile was a Public Profile shall remain public after any change to a Restricted Profile.

More detailed information about Myspace's Profile Settings is available [here](https://web.archive.org/settings/profile).

**Account ID And Profile ID**

When you create an Account, Myspace assigns an " **Account ID** " to identify and organize information relating to your Account and a " **Profile ID** " for each Profile associated with an Account (collectively, your " **Myspace IDs** "). The Profile ID may allow Myspace to provide a unique internet URL for your Profile (" **Profile URL** "). As described above, Myspace IDs and/or Profile URLs constitute Public Information and may therefore be viewed, accessed, and/or used by anyone with access to the Myspace Services. You cannot restrict access to Public Information through your Profile Settings. Please note that we may link your Myspace IDs with other information about you.

    2. Information We Collect Or Store As You Access And Use The Myspace Services

In addition to the information that you choose to submit to us via the Myspace Services, we and our third-party service providers may also collect certain information about you automatically, including through the use of various technologies that passively store or collect certain information whenever you interact with the Myspace Services. This may include information about the nature of a User's interactions with the Myspace Services, such as his or her media consumption activities (" **Usage Information** "). Usage Information may be stored or accessed using a variety of technologies (" **Tracking Technologies** "), some of which may be downloaded to the computer or other device that you use to access the Myspace Services (each a " **Device** "). The Usage Information that we collect may be non identifying or it may be associated with you, your Account, and your Profile(s). In the event we collect certain information about your interaction with the Myspace Services while you are a Visitor, Myspace may associate that information with your Account if you subsequently become a Member. 

Examples of the Usage Information we may collect include:

      * your IP address or other unique identifiers assigned to your Device (collectively, " **Device Identifiers** "). A Device Identifier is a string of numbers, letters or characters that is automatically assigned to your Device used to access the Myspace Services, and our computers identify your Device by its Device Identifier;
      * your Device functionality ( _e.g._ , browser type, operating system, hardware, mobile network information, _etc_.);
      * the URL that referred you to the Myspace Services;
      * the areas within the Myspace Services that you visit and your activities there, including remembering you and your preferences, which artists you are listening to, what videos you are viewing, or Profiles or Object Pages you choose to connect with, _etc_.;
      * your Device location (including using GPS and longitude and latitude location information);
      * your Device characteristics; 
      * certain other Device data ( _e.g._ , the time of day); and
      * ranking information about you with respect to other Users or Objects ( _e.g._ , Myspace may record the links to Objects that you post and rank your association with that Object compared to other Users). 

Please note that Tracking Technologies may set, change, alter, or modify settings or configurations on your Device. You may be able to disable certain Tracking Technologies as outlined below. In addition, you can avoid tracking by not interacting with the Myspace Services and uninstalling any mobile or other applications for which Myspace is the application publisher. Examples of some of the Tracking Technologies that may collect information about you through the Myspace Services include the following:

**Cookies**. A cookie is a data file placed on a Device when it is used to visit the Myspace Services. A Flash cookie (or locally shared object) is a data file placed on a Device via the Adobe Flash plug-in that may be built-in to or downloaded by you to your Device. HTML5 cookies can be programmed through HTML5 local storage. Unlike Flash cookies, HTML5 cookies do not require a plug-in. Regular cookies may generally be disabled or removed by tools that are available as part of most commercial internet browsers, and in some instances can be blocked in the future by selecting certain settings. Each browser you use will need to be set separately and different browsers offer different functionality and options in this regard. Also, these tools may not be effective with regard to Flash cookies or HTML5 cookies. For information on disabling Flash cookies go to Adobe's website [www.adobe.com](https://www.adobe.com/). Please be aware that if you disable or remove cookies, Flash cookies, or HTML5 cookies on your Device, some parts of the Myspace Services may not function properly, and that when you revisit the Myspace Services your ability to limit cookies is subject to your browser settings and limitations.

**Web Beacons**. Small graphic images or other web programming code called web beacons (also known as "1x1 GIFs" or "clear GIFs") may be included in the Myspace Services' pages and messages. Web beacons may be invisible to you, but any electronic image or other web programming code inserted into a page or e-mail can act as a web beacon. Web beacons or similar technologies may be used for a number of purposes, including to: count visitors to the Myspace Services, to monitor how users navigate the Myspace Services, to count how many e-mails that were sent were actually opened or to count how many particular articles or links were actually viewed.

**Embedded Scripts**. An embedded script is programming code that is designed to collect information about your interactions with the Myspace Services, such as the links you click on. The code is temporarily downloaded onto your Device from our web server or a third party service provider, is active only while you are connected to the Myspace Services, and is deactivated or deleted thereafter.

**ETag, or entity tag**. A feature of the cache in browsers. It is an opaque identifier assigned by a web server to a specific version of a resource found at a URL. If the resource content at that URL ever changes, a new and different ETag is assigned. Used in this manner ETags are a form of Device Identifier. ETag tracking may generate unique tracking values even where the consumer blocks HTTP, Flash, and/or HTML5 cookies.

We may use Tracking Technologies for a variety of purposes, including those that are:

**Strictly Necessary**. We may use Tracking Technologies that are strictly necessary to allow you to use and access the Myspace Services, including cookies required to prevent fraudulent activity or improve security.

**Performance Related**. We may use Tracking Technologies that are useful in order to assess the performance of the Myspace Services, including as part of our analytic practices or otherwise to improve the content, products, or services offered through the Myspace Services.

**Functionality Related**. We may use Tracking Technologies that are required to offer you enhanced functionality when accessing the Myspace Services, including identifying you when you sign in to the Myspace Services or keeping track of our specified preferences, including in terms of the presentation of content on the Myspace Services.

**Targeting Related**. We may use Tracking Technologies to deliver content, including ads, relevant to your interests on the Myspace Services and third party sites based on how you interact with our advertisements or content (including your video and audio consumption on or through the Myspace Services). This includes using Tracking Technologies to understand the usefulness to you of the advertisements or content that has been delivered to you. 

There may be other Tracking Technologies now and later devised and used by us in connection with the Myspace Services. Further, third parties may use Tracking Technologies with the Myspace Services. We may not control those Tracking Technologies and we are not responsible for them. However, you consent to potentially encountering third party Tracking Technologies in connection with use of the Myspace Services and accept that our statements under this Policy do not apply to the Tracking Technologies or practices of such third parties. For more information on advertising and advertisers, related Tracking Technologies, and the options that may be available to you, click here.

    3. Information We Receive From Third-Party Linked Services

Myspace may collect certain information about you from third-party websites, platforms, or services in the event you choose to take advantage of various features that may allow you to integrate information on or to the Myspace Services. For example, Myspace may provide you with the option to voluntarily: (i) sync content from Twitter that will appear on the Myspace Services in your activity feed; (ii) authenticate your identity and register for Myspace using Facebook's authentication protocol; or (iii) otherwise integrate information from third-party sources (each, an " **Integration** "). Similarly, we may allow third-party websites, platforms, or services to develop software applications to work within the Myspace Services that you can elect to install on your Account (each, an " **App** "). These Apps provide additional functionality to the Myspace Services and may be branded as " **Spaces** ". 

Integrations and Apps are collectively referred to in this Policy as " **Third-Party Linked Services** ". Should you voluntarily choose to take advantage of the Third-Party Linked Services offered through the Myspace Services, we may receive certain information about you from the relevant third-party providers, including the following:

      * Name
      * Nickname or username
      * Photo or graphic avatar
      * Unique third-party website identifier ( _e.g._ , Facebook User ID)
      * Biographical or Demographic Information ( _e.g._ , professional title, gender, college attended, etc.)
      * Likes and interests
      * Connections
      * Content accessed or associated with your third party service account ( _e.g._ , articles, songs, videos)
      * Any information that is publicly available on third-party websites
      * Device location (including GPS and longitude and latitude location information)
      * Other information that you choose to share with Myspace

While Myspace will treat any information received from third parties (including providers of Third-Party Linked Services) as set forth in this Policy, the information practices of third parties are not governed by this Policy. Myspace cannot control the treatment of your information by third parties and we are not responsible for their privacy practices, which may differ from those described in this Policy. We encourage you to review the privacy policies and terms of service of any such third parties prior to choosing to integrate and/or install them on your Account or disclosing information to them. For example, you should review the privacy practices of providers of Third-Party Linked Services prior to performing an Integration or installing an App on your Device so that you can understand how they may collect, use, and/or share your information, whether through the Myspace Services or otherwise. If you have any questions regarding a third party's information practices, you must contact the relevant entity directly.

    4. Information Third Parties Provide About You

**Information We Receive From Specific Media**

Myspace may receive from our affiliate Specific Media various types of information about you that Specific Media collects or infers from your interactions with its advertising network. This may include information such as your Demographic Information, Usage Information, and Device Identifier. For additional details regarding how Specific Media collects, uses, and shares information, please consult Specific Media's privacy policy [here](https://specificmedia.com/privacy).

**Information We Receive From Other Third Parties**

We may also receive certain information about you from various other third parties who help Myspace to provide the Myspace Services. For example, Myspace may receive information regarding upcoming events that are relevant to artists that control Artist Profiles (as defined in the [Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/web/20130116033711id_/http%3A//new.myspace.com/pages/terms)). This allows artists to supplement their existing Artist Profiles by displaying the event-related information, which becomes Profile Content subject to the privacy practices outlined in this Policy. In addition, we may obtain certain data about Users from data suppliers in order to help Myspace and its advertising partners (including Specific Media) serve you with advertisements that are more relevant to your preferences and behaviors. Myspace may also receive information about you from your friends and other third parties that use the Myspace Services, such as when they submit content to us or post on the Myspace Services. 

From time-to-time, we may supplement the information we collect directly through the Myspace Services with outside records from other third parties for similar purposes ( _e.g._ , enhancing our ability to serve you, tailor content to your preferences, offer you relevant opportunities, _etc_.). 

    5. Information You Provide About A Third Party

If you choose to take advantage of this functionality, we may ask you to provide us with certain information about the person with whom you wish to communicate (e.g., name, e-mail address, mobile number, etc.). Myspace collects such information for the purposes of facilitating the requested communication, which may contain a specific promotional message from you (e.g., an invitation to register for the Myspace Services). Unless we explicitly say otherwise, Myspace will not use this information for other marketing purposes without first obtaining consent from the person to whom the relevant information pertains. Please be aware that when you use any send-to-a-friend functionality on the Myspace Services, your e-mail address, mobile number, name or username, and message may be included in the communication sent to your addressee(s).

These third parties assist us in providing and managing the Myspace Services in a variety of different manners, including by: (i) developing or supporting products and features; (ii) supporting our marketing efforts (e.g., conducting e-mail marketing campaigns on our behalf); (iii) processing payments; (iv) administering message boards; (v) fulfilling orders; (vi) processing data or statistics; (vii) hosting media content; (viii) reviewing content for compliance with the [Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/web/20130116033711id_/http%3A//new.myspace.com/pages/terms); and (ix) assisting with the administration, judging, and prize fulfillment aspects of contests, promotions, and sweepstakes.

Myspace may provide such information to these analytics providers for the purpose of obtaining statistics and other information about how Users are using and interacting with the Myspace Services. These analytics providers may use their own Tracking Technologies to recognize your Device and they may otherwise collect or have access to information about you, potentially including your Profile Content, Demographic Information, Usage Information and/or Device Identifiers. These third-party Tracking Technologies may be used directly on the Myspace Services. We are not responsible for those third-party Tracking Technologies or activities arising out of them. Please also keep in mind that your web browser may not permit you to block the use of these Tracking Technologies, and that browser settings that block conventional cookies may have no effect on such Tracking Technologies. Some third-party analytics providers may offer you certain choices regarding their practices, and information we have been informed of regarding such choices is available here. We are not responsible for the effectiveness of or compliance with any third parties' opt-out choices.

      4. To Allow Other Users To Find You

Myspace uses Public Information (e.g., full name, username, etc.) and Restricted Information (e.g., Profile Content that has been restricted by Profile Settings) in connection with search inquiries by other Users when searching for and attempting to locate other Members to establish potential matches to search criteria using tools made available as part of the MySpace Services. However, we make good faith efforts not to display to other Users your Restricted Information except in accordance with your Profile Settings. Please note that Members under the self-reported age of 18 are not intended to show up in the results of Myspace's "people browse" feature (other than respect to Artist Profiles for artists whose indicated age is under the age of 18 and may appear in people browse results), which allows Users to browse for Members based on certain criteria inputted by a User. Please contact us [here](https://web.archive.org/help) if you notice any discrepancy. Myspace will make good faith efforts to ensure the accuracy of its own search tool, but it does not warrant or guarantee the accuracy of search results.

      5. To Deliver Relevant Content And Recommendations

To make your experience more interesting or relevant, we may use certain information you provide, or that we collect about you ( _e.g._ , Profile Content, including without limitation page views, queries, media consumption, and connections between your Profile and other Profiles or Objects), and information we may collect from other Users and third parties ( _e.g._ , Facebook or Twitter), to assist us in recommending connections to Members and Objects to you on Myspace. Myspace may also combine your information with information collected by Specific Media or others to improve the Myspace Services and to make content recommendations to you. 

      6. To Create A Social Media Consumption Experience And To Create Top Fans and to Create Top Fans

As part of the Myspace Services, your Usage Information and Profile Content (including video viewing and audio access) may be shared with other Users. To make your content consumption experience more social and fun, to improve services, to perform analytics, to compare your usage to other Users, to rank your linkages with certain content or Users, and to better make suggestions about other content, we may use any of the information you provide and the information we collect about you and we may share the content of the media that you access on or through the Myspace Services with other Users. For example, the type of information we may use includes Usage Information gathered from your contributions to Object pages, use of IP-delivered TV, tablet or smart phone applications, set top boxes and other devices, and connections between your Profile and other Profiles or Objects. The types of media content that may be shared can include video and audio content. You agree that we may share your media access through Myspace Services (including video viewing and audio content access) as an Activity Notification (as more fully described in the next section), in your own activity stream, your connections' activity streams or on the Object Pages where the content that you are consuming or interacting with resides, in each case, both on the Myspace Website, and on any other Myspace Services, including for example, Myspace TV, which may be accessible on Devices that offer IP-delivered TV.

For example, if you watched a music video by Adele, Myspace may share your Profile Content (including, for example, your full name, username and/or Profile Picture) on the Object Page where such music video resides on the Myspace Services and may indicate that you have viewed such music video on your own Profile, as part of your Profile Content or elsewhere. **Myspace makes this feature public to everyone by default, and anyone can see these Activity Notifications**. Note that if your Profile is a Restricted Profile, the Profiles that you have allowed to connect to you will still see your Activity Notifications regarding your content consumption on Myspace. From time-to-time we may offer you with options, such as an option to opt out on a session basis, or a persistent basis, from Activity Notifications related to your content consumption. Currently, the setting for this feature is located on the right side of the "Deck", which is the horizontal strip that dynamically rises out of the player at the bottom of the screen that contains your playback queue, however, the setting may also be added to Profile Settings, or elsewhere on other Myspace Services, for example, Myspace TV™. For more information, please visit [here](https://web.archive.org/settings/profile/privacy). We will make good faith efforts to honor such elections. Session settings are intended to last only as long as your Myspace page is open in your browser. If you close your browser, the session-based setting will be reset to public, and your song and video play Activity Notifications will default to the visibility setting associated with your Profile's visibility. **You should always check the content consumption Activity Notification setting each time you use the Myspace Services, so that you are aware of and comfortable with your media consumption appearing as Activity Notifications.**

We may use Usage Information (such as about your media consumption, connections to certain Objects or Profiles, and posts regarding Objects or Profiles), and your Profile Content, to rank the magnitude of your connection to Profiles or Objects (" **Affinity Information** "). This allows us to identify " **Top Fans** ", and we may use your Public Information to display that you are a Top Fan of a certain Object or Profile. Anyone may see your status as a Top Fan, and such status is Public Information. We also may provide analytics tools to Artist Profiles that allow the owners of such Artist Profiles to see Public Information of Users who strongly engage with the Artist Profile or the Objects controlled by the Artist Profile ( _e.g._ , videos or songs or such Artist Profile), even if such Users are not connected to the Artist Profile.

**Unless otherwise noted or enabled, you should be aware of, and you consent to your consumption of media on the Myspace Services being Public Information.**

      7. To Provide Activity Notifications

Myspace may use your Usage Information and/or Profile Content to create Activity Notifications about your use of the Myspace Services. Other than as set forth below, the visibility of your Activity Notifications is linked to the visibility settings of your Profile, which we will make good faith efforts to honor. Your Profile visibility setting is accessible [here](https://web.archive.org/settings/profile/privacy). For Public Profiles, Activity Notifications are viewable and accessible by anyone who is using the Myspace Services. For Restricted Profiles, other than as set forth below, Activity Notifications should be viewable and accessible only to the Profiles that you have allowed to connect to you. 

With respect to Activity Notifications for your content consumption ( _e.g._ , views of videos or listens to audio tracks), the Profiles that you have allowed to connect to you will, **by default** , still see media consumption Activity Notifications even if you have a Restricted Profile. From time to time, we may offer you with options, such as an option to opt out on a session basis, or a persistent basis, from Activity Notifications related to your content consumption. Currently, the setting for this feature is located on the right side of the "Deck", which is the horizontal strip that dynamically rises out of the player at the bottom of the screen that contains your playback queue; however, the setting may also be added to Profile Settings, or elsewhere on other Myspace Services, for example, within the settings functionality of Myspace TV. For more information, please visit [here](https://web.archive.org/settings/profile/privacy). We will make good faith efforts to honor such elections. Session settings are intended to last only as long as your Myspace page is open in your browser. If you close your browser, the session-based setting will be reset to public, and your song and video play Activity Notifications will default to the visibility setting associated with your Profile's visibility. _**You should always check the content consumption Activity Notification setting each time you use the Myspace Services, so that you are aware of and comfortable with your media consumption appearing as Activity Notifications.**_

Examples of activities that may generate Activity Notifications include: (i) posting status updates; (ii) commenting on a post; (iii) sharing content or posting on the Myspace Services; (iv) sharing content or posting to a Third-Party Linked Service; (v) connecting to a Profile or other Object ( _e.g._ , a photo, photo album, video, song, etc.); (vi) being tagged in a photo; (vii) commenting on a photo album; (viii) adding a photo to a photo album; (ix) playing a song or watching a video; (x) adding a song to a mix; (xi) updating a Profile; and (xii) adding a cover photo. An example of an actual Activity Notification on the Myspace Services is the following: "John Doe listened to the song 'True Love Waits'." Activity Notifications may include Profile Content ( _e.g._ , your full name and Profile photo), and some may aggregate your activity with activity of third parties ( _e.g._ , "John Doe and Sally Smith connected to a photo.").

The available visibility settings and options affecting your Profile and your Profile Content may change from time to time. We will try to make you aware of the visibility setting options may be available at a given time, and to honor your elections, but delays and errors may occur, so we do not warrant that the settings will be complete, error-free, current, reliable or accurate, nor do we guarantee that setting changes you make will take effect immediately. We will make good faith efforts to honor your visibility settings and setting changes, and you can bring any setting errors to our attention via the [Help Site](https://web.archive.org/help).

      9. To Deliver Relevant Advertisements On Myspace And Across Other Networks

Many of the Myspace Services are free to Users because they are supported by advertising. You may be served ads on the Myspace Services, including based on your location, information and/or behavior, and we and third parties may use Tracking Technologies to do so. If you object to our advertising practices, do not use the Myspace Services and uninstall our mobile applications. We strive to make the Myspace Services interesting, relevant, and personalized for our Users, while keeping as many of the Myspace Services free as possible. To achieve this goal and support the costs of providing the Myspace Services for free, you consent to our sharing of your Demographic Information, Usage Information, Device Identifiers, and e-mail address with our advertising partners (including our affiliates, such as Specific Media), to enable customization of the advertising displayed to you when you visit the Myspace Services and other websites across the internet and other platforms, services and networks, including mobile. For example, based on your music interests shared on the Myspace Services, Specific Media might display an advertisement informing you that one of your favorite bands is releasing a new record, either on any of the Myspace Services or on another website or service that you visit for which Specific Media delivers advertising. These parties may in turn share your information with others. For additional information regarding the privacy practices of our third-party advertising partners, as well as the choices that they may make available to you, please click here.

The Myspace Services' third-party ad network and exchange providers, the advertisers, the sponsors and/or traffic measurement services may themselves set and access their own Tracking Technologies and track certain behavioral Usage Information regarding users of your Device via a Device Identifier. These third-party Tracking Technologies may be set to, among other things: (i) help deliver advertisements to you that you might be interested in; (ii) prevent you from seeing the same advertisements too many times; and (iii) understand the usefulness to you of the advertisements that have been delivered to you. You acknowledge and agree that associated technology may access and use your Device and may set or change settings on your Device in connection with the associated operations. Note that any images (or any other parts of content) served by third parties in association with third-party ads or other content may serve as web beacons, which enable third parties to carry out the previously described activities.

Third-party Tracking Technologies are not controlled by us, even if they use our site or technology to help store or collect data. Statements regarding our practices do not apply to the methods for collecting information used by these third-party advertisers and others or the use of the information that such third parties collect. We do, however, work with third parties to make efforts to have you provided with information on their practices and any available opportunity to exercise choice. The relevant third party's terms of service, privacy policy, permissions, notices and choices should be reviewed regarding their collection, storage and sharing practices. We make no representations regarding the policies or practices of third-party advertisers or advertising networks or exchanges or related third parties. However, some may offer you certain choices regarding their practices, and information we have been informed of regarding such choices is available here.

Further, while we may use a variety of companies to serve advertisements on the Myspace Services, you may wish to visit <https://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp>, which provides information regarding this practice by Network Advertising Initiative ("NAI") members, and your choices regarding having this information used by these companies, including the "opt-out" procedures of NAI members. Opting out of one or more NAI members only means that those NAI members no longer will be allowed under their own rules to deliver targeted content and/or ads to you, which will affect the Myspace Services and other sites, but does not mean you will no longer receive any targeted content and/or ads. Also, if your browsers are configured to reject cookies when you visit this opt-out page, or you subsequently erase your cookies, use a different Device or change web browsers, your NAI opt-out may not, or may no longer, be effective. Additional information is available on the NAI's web site accessible by the above link. In the U.S., you may also opt-out of receiving third-party behavioral ads on this site by visiting <https://www.aboutads.info/choices/#completed>, or in the E.U. by visiting [https://www.youronlinechoices.com](https://www.youronlinechoices.com/). Similar limitations may apply to these opt-out methods. We are not responsible for effectiveness of or compliance with any third parties' opt-out options. 

      10. To Deliver Social Advertising To You And Your Friends

Myspace and Myspace's ad-technology provider(s), including, for example, our affiliate, including Specific Media, and third-party providers, may also use Profile Content (both Public Information and Restricted Information) when delivering advertisements to you, your Myspace connections, other Users, and other users on the Specific Media advertising network or third-party advertising networks, including for example, by including your full name, username and/or photo in, or in connection with, sponsored content and advertisements. By using the Myspace Services, you consent to the use of your Myspace Profile Content and your Myspace Services activity information (including regarding your content consumption) in, or in connection with, sponsored content and advertisements shown to your Myspace connections, other Users, or other users on the advertising network operated by Specific Media and third-party advertising networks.

However, we may, from time to time, offer you options to manage this type of social advertising via your Profile Settings, and Myspace will, and will require Specific Media or other providers to make good faith efforts to respect Profile Settings when delivering social advertisements. For more information on these setting options, visit [here](https://web.archive.org/settings/profile).

      11. To Protect The Rights Of Myspace And Our Users

      12. Business Transfers

Myspace may disclose User information in the event we file for bankruptcy, or in connection with certain types of business transactions that result in corporate change. For example, if Myspace is or may be (or substantially all of its assets are or may be) acquired by a third party pursuant to an acquisition, merger, sale, reorganization, liquidation, or similar business transfer, we may disclose and transfer User information to the parties involved in the transaction ( _e.g._ , in connection with due diligence efforts or as a transferred asset).

      13. Co-Branded Areas

Certain areas of the Myspace Services may be provided to you in association with third parties (" **Co-Branded Areas** ") such as sponsors, charities and political organizations and will generally require you to disclose Personal Information to them. Such Co-Branded Areas will identify the third party and indicate if they have a privacy policy that applies to their collection and use of you information. If you elect to register for products and/or services, communicate with such third parties or download their content or applications, at Co-Branded Areas, you may be providing your information to both us and the third party. Further, if you sign-in to a Co-Branded Area with a username and password obtained on the Myspace Services, your Personal Information may be disclosed to the identified third parties for that Co-Branded Area. We are not responsible for such third party's data collection or practices and you should look to such third-party privacy policies for more information.

Even after you cancel your Account or delete information or Profile Content, copies of some information from your Account or Profile(s) may remain viewable in circumstances where, for example, you have posted information on another User's Profile, shared information with a Third-Party Linked Service, or if another Visitor or Member copied, stored or shared your information or has a copy of the link to content you shared on the Myspace Services. To the extent permitted by applicable law, we may also retain backup information related to your Account and associated Profile(s) on our servers for as long as is reasonably necessary after cancellation for fraud detection, site operation or to comply with applicable law or our internal security policies. Please be aware that, due to the nature of certain internet and mobile technologies outside of our control, such as caching and networked technology, your Account may not be instantly inaccessible to others, and there may be a delay in the removal of your information and content from elsewhere on the internet and from search engines. 

If you do not want to receive promotional (i.e., commercial) e-mail from us in the future, please contact us [here](https://web.archive.org/help).

Please note that there might be a brief delay between when you submit your request to "opt-out" and when it is processed and reflected in our systems.
