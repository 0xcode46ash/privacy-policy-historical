# Ask Jeeves About

Ask Jeeves Inc., producer of the Ask Jeeves and Ask Jeeves for Kids Web sites, believes that online privacy is crucial for the ongoing success of the Internet as a service, commercial and entertainment medium. We collect personal information from you primarily to make using the Ask Jeeves services easier and more satisfying. In registering for certain services offered by Ask Jeeves you may be asked to provide your name, e-mail address, zip code, gender and information about what you do and don't like. We request this information from you so that we can provide you with the personalized service necessary to meet Ask Jeeves' goal of humanizing the Internet. However, unless you designate otherwise, the personally identifiable information you provide will be known only to you and to Ask Jeeves. We will always ask you before providing this information to anyone else. If others want this information, including your name or your email address, we will provide it only if you give us permission to do so. 

From time to time, Ask Jeeves may introduce new products and services to its users. To the extent these new products and services affect this policy, this policy will be updated and you will be informed of these updates and any privacy conditions related to these services. 

Information gathered online can generally be categorized as either anonymous or personally identifiable. Anonymous information is information that cannot be traced back to a specific individual. For example, Ask Jeeves knows how many questions are asked each day at each of its Web sites but does not know the names, e-mail addresses or gender of the people asking the questions. 

Personally identifiable information is information you provide that lets us know specific facts about you so that we can customize the information Ask Jeeves delivers to you accordingly. This information can include your name, address, zip code, age, etc. For example, when you provide your home zip code when you register for Personal Jeeves, Ask Jeeves is able to provide you with weather forecasts for your hometown. It is our belief that you will find it beneficial to provide us with personal information so that your experience with Ask Jeeves is more satisfying. 

**Gathering and Use of Anonymous Information**  
Each time a visitor comes to an Ask Jeeves Web site, we collect some information to improve the overall quality of the online experience, including product monitoring, product improvement, and targeted advertising. At the Ask Jeeves Web sites, we collect the visitor's domain name (e.g. whether the user is logged on from compaq.com or whitehouse.gov), referral data (e.g., we record the address of the last URL a user visited prior to clicking through to an Ask Jeeves Web site), and browser and platform type (e.g., a Netscape browser on a Macintosh platform). 

In addition to collecting these types of information, Ask Jeeves collects aggregate queries for internal reporting and targeted advertising. We also count, track, and aggregate the visitor's activity into our analysis of general traffic flows at our sites (e.g. tracking where traffic comes from, how traffic flows within the Ask Jeeves properties, etc.). To these ends, we may merge information about you into group data, which may then be shared on an aggregated basis with our advertisers; but Ask Jeeves will not disclose your individual identity or personal data without your permission. When Ask Jeeves does present aggregated information to outside companies, no one will be able to identify or contact you. 

**Gathering and Use of Personally Identifiable Information**   
Ask Jeeves requests that registrants for its Personal Jeeves service provide personal information so that we can provide personalized service. As we have already stated, personally identifiable information is not shared with third parties unless Ask Jeeves has your permission to do so. In addition, Ask Jeeves occasionally sponsors sweepstakes, contests, or other events that require the collection, processing, and storage of individual contact and demographic information to be used for the event. Ask Jeeves sometimes co-sponsors these events with other companies, in which case the user's individual contact and demographic information is likely to be shared with participating sponsors. A registrant's personal contact and demographic information will not be released to third-party or non-participating organizations without the user's consent, and Ask Jeeves will request that co-sponsors of such events maintain the privacy of the registrants' information. 

When appropriate, users will be given the opportunity to receive information from third-party organizations in connection with services or events offered by Ask Jeeves. This option may be made available through Ask Jeeves' registration and/or through registration processes maintained by a participating third party. In all cases, you will be informed before you register for the event or service that a third party will be receiving the registration information you provide and you will have the option not to participate in any service or event that requires third party involvement. 

**Use Of Ask Jeeves Cookies**   
Ask Jeeves' Web sites use cookies to track traffic flow and patterns of travel within and through the sites. Cookies are a standard Internet technology that allow us to both store and retrieve login information on a user's system. Our Web server automatically asks a new user whether his or her browser will agree to accept an Ask Jeeves cookie file. If a visitor accepts, our Web server will identify the user's cookie for Ask Jeeves' use in internal reporting. If a user accepts an Ask Jeeves cookie, but would later like to remove it from his or her computer, he or she can just remove it from the browser.

**Demographic Information**   
When we do present information to our advertisers, it is in the form of grouped statistics compiled from our users' answers to survey questions and on-site behavior. Ask Jeeves will not disclose the contact or demographic information of any individual user to advertisers or any other outside organization without the express permission of the individual. 

**User Research**   
On occasion, Ask Jeeves will make available to potential advertisers and research firms aggregated results from research it has conducted on its user base. Once again, Ask Jeeves will only provide such demographic information on an aggregated basis and does not disclose individual member profiles without user consent. 

**Special Policy With Regards to Information from Children Under Thirteen**   
In accordance with the Federal Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA), Ask Jeeves will never knowingly request personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13 without parental consent. When we do receive information (with parental consent) from users under the age of 13, we will never voluntarily share their personally identifiable information with third parties, regardless of their stated preference given at registration.
