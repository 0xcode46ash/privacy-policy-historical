Your User ID is displayed throughout **askbazar** (and so available to the public), and is connected to all of your **askbazar** activity. Other people can see your bids, purchases, items for sale, storefronts, feedback, ratings and associated comments. Notices sent to other community members about suspicious activity and policy violations on our sites refer to User IDs and specific items. So if you associate your name with your User ID, the people to whom you have revealed your name will be able to personally identify your **askb** azar activities. 

  * ###  Using Information from askbazar 




**Askbazar** enables you to share personal and financial information to complete transactions. We encourage you to disclose your privacy practices and respect the privacy of other users. We cannot guarantee the privacy or security of your information and therefore we encourage you to evaluate the privacy and security policies of your trading partner before entering into a transaction and choosing to share your information. To help protect your privacy, we allow only limited access to other users' contact, shipping and financial information to facilitate your transactions.

  * ###  No Spam, Spyware or Spoofing




We and our users do not tolerate spam. Make sure to set your **askbazar** communication preferences so we communicate to you as you prefer. You are not licensed to add other **askbazar** users, even a user who has purchased an item from you, to your mailing list (email or physical mail) without their express consent.

  * ###  Account Protection 




Your password is the key to your account. Use unique numbers, letters and special characters, and do not disclose your **askbazar** password to anyone. If you do share your password or your personal information with others, remember that you are responsible for all actions taken in the name of your account. If you lose control of your password, you may lose substantial control over your personal information and may be subject to legally binding actions taken on your behalf. Therefore, if your password has been compromised for any reason, you should immediately notify us and change your password. 

  * ### Accessing, Reviewing and Changing Your Personal Information 




You can see, review and change most of your personal information by signing on to **askbazar.** Generally, we will not manually modify your personal information because it is very difficult to verify your identity remotely. You must promptly update your personal information if it changes or is inaccurate. Once you make a public posting, you may not be able to change or remove it. 

  * ###   Security 




Your information is stored on our server. We treat data as an asset that must be protected and use lots of tools (encryption, passwords, physical security, etc.) to protect your personal information against unauthorized access and disclosure.

  * ###   Third Parties




### Except as otherwise expressly included in this Privacy Policy, this document addresses only the use and disclosure of information we collect from you. If you disclose it to anybody else, askbazar does not control the privacy policies of third parties and you are subject to the privacy policies of those third parties where applicable.
