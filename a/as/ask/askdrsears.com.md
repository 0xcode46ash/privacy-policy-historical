## Searching

My site has been designed to get you to the information you seek quickly. Quite honestly, I believe most web site search tools return too many results, thus the information you seek is still difficult to find. My site actually conducts three searches every time you press the submit button. Although each search is broader in scope it is still possible that my site may not return the information you seek. If this happens please try the following: 

### 1\. Try using just key words

_Example:_  
Instead of "My baby has a 100 degree temperature. What do I do?" try: 

### 2\. Try substituting key words or phrases for words that mean the same thing

_Example:_  
Instead of "What is attachment parenting?" try: 

### 3\. Try finding your subject by starting at "Index A-to-Z"

Often it is easier to find what you are looking for by starting in our [index of parenting topics](https://web.archive.org/web/20010405040728id_/http%3A//www.askdrsears.com/html/10/index.asp).
