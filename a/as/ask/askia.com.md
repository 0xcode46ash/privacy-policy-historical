# Privacy policy - Askia - software for surveys

This is the **Askia SAS** website. This privacy policy concerns all existing and future websites, portals, online applications linked to the [http://www.askia.com](http://www.askia.com/ "http://www.askia.com") domain.

This currently includes the corporate website ([http://www.askia.com](http://www.askia.com/ "http://www.askia.com")) as well as the **Askia User Area** (<https://dev.askia.com/login>).

**Our Commitment To Privacy:**  
Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used. To make this notice easy to find, we make it available on our homepage and at every point where personally identifiable information may be requested.

**The Information We Collect:**  
This notice applies to all information collected or submitted on the Askia websites. On some pages, you can make requests, submit issues and contact us. The types of personal information collected at these pages are:

  * Name 
  * Company email address 
  * Password 
  * Language 
  * Content information (submitted issue, business query, …) 



**The Way We Use Information:**  
We use the information you provide about yourself when placing an issue only to complete that issue. We do not share this information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to complete that issue.  
We use return email addresses to answer the email we receive. Such addresses are not used for any other purpose and are not shared with outside parties.

You can register with our websites if you would like to contact us, submit issues, retrieve software updates or documentation.  
Finally, we never use or share the personally identifiable information provided to us online in ways unrelated to the ones described above without also providing you an opportunity to opt-out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses.

**Our Commitment To Data Security**  
To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online.  
We have thus registered our User Area to [Comodo CA Ltd](http://www.comodo.com/business-security/digital-certificates/wildcard-ssl.php).

**How You Can Access Or Correct Your Information**  
You can access all your personally identifiable information that we collect online and maintain by accessing your account page (<https://dev.askia.com/my/account>). We use this procedure to better safeguard your information.  
You can correct factual errors in your personally identifiable information by sending us a request that credibly shows error.  
To protect your privacy and security, we will also take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access or making corrections.
