# AskBobRankin - Privacy Policy

In a nutshell... This website does not collect any personally identifying information, unless YOU choose to provide it -- such as when subscribing to an email newsletter, or making a purchase. 

We do not sell or share your information with anyone. It is used only to provide the services described on this website. Your information is held in strict confidence. 

## Your Email Address is Safe

Because I respect your privacy, I pledge that I **will not rent, sell or otherwise reveal your e-mail address** to any third party. The only exceptions would be the acquisition or sale of this website, or a court order compelling me to provide such data. 

Spam (unsolicited junk e-mail) is the bane of the Internet, and I hate it as much as you do. In fact, I have been quite active over the years educating readers about spam, where it comes from, and how to avoid it. 

I further protect privacy and e-mail security in general by requiring that new subscribers confirm their subscriptions. This prevents people from harassing others by subscribing them to something they may not want. When you submit an email subscription request, you will receive an automatic message asking you to confirm the subscription. You _must_ reply to this message before your subscription will be activated. And of course, you may always cancel your subscription at any time.

## Editorial Mail

Email messages sent to this website are considered public statements and become the property of the publisher. Unless noted otherwise in the message itself, such messages may be published in whole or in part. Such publication may include your name and location, but per our e-mail privacy policy will not include your e-mail address. 

## Security

This website has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control. All information that we collect or store is accessible only by the publisher, and technical staff at our online service providers. 

## Logs

This website runs on a standard unix web server that logs visitor information such as the type of browser you are using, your IP address, time, date, and pages viewed. An IP address does NOT reveal the identify of a website visitor - it only reveals the identify of the visitor's Internet Service Provider. We use IP addresses to help diagnose possible problems encountered on our web server. Neither your email address nor any other personally identifiable information is stored in the server log. 

## Use of Browser Cookies

Cookies have the potential to add useful functionality to a website, and enhance the visitor's browsing experience in many ways. This site, and perhaps the advertisers who make this free service possible, may use cookies to get statistics on who sees what ads, whether you click on the ads, etc. 

## Third-Party Advertisers

We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our website. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address, or telephone number) about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, [click here](http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html). 

The presence of third-party advertisements on this site should not be taken as an endorsement of those products or services.
