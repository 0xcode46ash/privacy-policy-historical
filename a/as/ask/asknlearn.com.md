Some of this information is essential for us to be able to accurately identify who is using the service and as such is mandatory.

The information we collect from you is strictly confidential. ASKnLearn.com will not reveal, disclose, sell, distribute, rent, licence, share or pass that information on to any third parties, other than those who are contracted by ASKnLearn.com to keep the information confidential or are subject to a statute or binding scheme which imposes similar restrictions to ASKnLearn.com ’s Privacy Protection Principles regarding the handling of personal information. We may disclose the personal information, other information or data we collect from you for the purpose specified to you at the time of collection or for another purpose if: 

>   * you would reasonably expect us to disclose it for that purpose; and

If we wish to disclose any of this personal information, information or data other than as set out above, we will not do so unless we have your express consent to do so. We will not provide your email address to third parties without your consent. 

We will take reasonable steps to ensure that all information we collect, use or disclose is accurate, complete, up-to-date and stored in a secure environment accessed only by authorised persons. Transmissions sent to or from ASKnLearn.com are routinely monitored for quality control and systems administration. 

Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. While we strive to protect your personal information from misuse, loss and unauthorised access, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you transmit to us or receive from our online products or services. These activities are conducted at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission, we make our best effort to ensure its security. 

Please be aware that whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information over the Internet (for example: in discussion forums, via email, or in chat sites) that this information can be collected and used by others. In short, if you post personal information in publicly accessible online forums, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return. 

You have the right, at anytime to modify, withdraw and access your personal information by writing to us at [support@asknlearn.com](mailto:support@asknlearn.com).

Ultimately, you are solely responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your username and passwords. Please be careful and responsible whenever you are using the Internet and ASKnLearn.com.
