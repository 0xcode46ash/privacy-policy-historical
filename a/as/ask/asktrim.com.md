Finally, we may collect additional information from or about you in other ways not specifically described here. We do not knowingly solicit or collect information from any individuals under the age of 18.

**Use of Information Collected by Us**

Our primary purpose in collecting Personal Information is to provide you with a safe, smooth, efficient, fun and customized experience. We may use your Personal Information to: provide the services and customer support you request; attempt to save you money; process transactions and send notices about your transactions or your network activity; resolve disputes, collect fees and troubleshoot problems; prevent potentially fraudulent, prohibited or illegal activities, customize, personalize, measure, and improve our services and the content and layout of our website; send you updates about new products and services that we are offering to customers; compare information for accuracy and verify it with third parties; and perform other duties as required by law.

We may use your financial information to facilitate social comparisons of spending patterns and other personal financial matters. We may use your "social graph" information provided by Facebook or other third-party data sources to facilitate these social comparisons. We will attempt to maintain anonymity for users in any social comparisons by displaying only aggregated data across multiple users. However, we cannot guarantee that these aggregate data sets will ensure anonymity.

**Sharing Personal Information**

We do not share your Personal Information with third parties for promotional or marketing purposes. However, we may share your Personal Information with:

  * Law enforcement, government officials, or other third parties if we are compelled to do so by a subpoena, court order or similar legal procedure, when it is necessary to do so to comply with law, or where the disclosure of personal information is reasonably necessary to prevent physical harm or financial loss, to report suspected illegal activity, or to investigate violations of the this Privacy Policy or the Terms of Service, or as otherwise required by law.
  * Third party service providers who assist us in providing services to you or who provide fraud detection or similar services.
  * Service providers under contract who help with parts of our business operations (for example, fraud prevention, payment processing, or technology services). Our contracts dictate that these service providers only use your information in connection with the services they perform for us and not for their own benefit.

Plaid and any other third party service providers that we may use to facilitate in the delivery of the Services may store your credit or debit card account information so you can use our Services in the future. We do not have your complete credit or debit card account information, store your credit or debit card account information, or have direct control over or responsibility for your credit or debit card account information. We cannot guarantee that transmissions of your credit or debit card account information or personal information will always be secure or that unauthorized third parties will never be able to defeat the security measures taken by us or our third-party service providers.

We assume no liability or responsibility for disclosure of your information due to errors in transmission, unauthorized third-party access, or other causes beyond our control.

**Protection & Storage**

We store and process your Personal Information and electronic copies of all correspondence using third party servers located in secure data centers in the United States.

We also use computer safeguards such as firewalls and data encryption, we enforce physical access controls to our office and files, and we authorize access to personal information only for those employees who require it to fulfill their job responsibilities.

The security of your Personal Information is important to us, and we strive to implement and maintain reasonable, commercially acceptable security procedures and practices appropriate to the nature of the information we store, in order to protect it from unauthorized access, destruction, use, modification, or disclosure. Despite our efforts, we cannot guarantee that personal information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered or destroyed by breach of our administrative, managerial and technical safeguards. Therefore, we urge you to take adequate precautions to protect your personal data as well, including never sharing your user password with anyone.

If we learn of a systems security breach, we may attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps. By using the Service, you agree that we may communicate with you electronically. We may post a notice on the website if a security breach occurs.
