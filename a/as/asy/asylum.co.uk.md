  * To tailor the content, communications, advertisements or promotions you receive when using the AOL Web Services.

#### Principle 3

We give you choices about how AOL uses your Personal Information. 

AOL may use your Personal Information in accordance with this Privacy Policy and our AOL Web Services Agreement.

**Will I receive marketing communications from AOL?**

Unless you tell us otherwise we may contact you by post (or telephone) to let you know about products and AOL Web Services that we think may be of interest to you. We'll only do this by email, SMS and other similar forms of communication where we're letting you know about AOL's goods and AOL Web Services similar to **AOL Web Services** you have used, or if you've told us that you'd like this to happen. 

**Will AOL pass my Personal Information to other companies for them to send marketing communications to me?**

Unless you tell us otherwise we may pass on your postal and telephone contact details to selected companies who may contact you by post (or telephone) to let you know about products and AOL Web Services that they think may be of interest to you.

However, for all online purchases that you may make from third parties whilst online with AOL, make sure that you review their privacy policies and contact them directly if you have any questions. They may have privacy policies that differ from AOL's, and they may therefore use Personal Information which you provide to them differently. 

You can review and change your marketing preferences at any time by visiting: Keyword [Marketing Preferences](aol://1722:marketingpreferences) or, if you do not use AOL Software at <http://www.aol.co.uk/marketingprefs>.

**Can I customise my experience of AOL using AOL software?**

AOL's client software offers you lots of flexibility in how the AOL Web Services are made available to you. You can easily amend your AOL settings, to make your experience more relevant to you (for example, you can create personalised email stationery and web pages).If you are enjoying AOL Web Services as a web user, then you may also tailor your experience - we provide links in appropriate areas, or visit [http://www.aol.co.uk/help.](http://www.aol.co.uk/help/)

As the choices you make about your preferences and settings may not take effect immediately, it is possible you may receive a communication which you have requested not to receive during the period in which your request is being processed. 

**What happens when my Web Services Account is cancelled**

If you cancel your Web Services Account or AOL cancels your Web Services Account (see the AOL Web Services Agreement), unless and until you indicate otherwise, your name, address, email address (other than your AOL web mail email address) and telephone number may: 

  1. be used by AOL Group Companies during and for a reasonable period of time after your Web Services Account is cancelled for the purposes described above; and

If you request a product or service which requires payment, we may collect payment details and ask you for your name, address, telephone number and an alternative email address. 

We will not give out such information unless you authorise it, for example, during an online purchase. However, if you provide us with a payment method which belongs to someone else, we may disclose your name and address, and data relating to payments made by that method to them. 

Just as you want to make sure that information AOL has about you is accurate, we want to keep only the most up-to-date information about your Web Services Account. We provide you with the opportunity to update or correct your contact and billing information that we have on file. AOL Keyword: [Billing](http://help.aol.co.uk/account-questions/article/20060627121509990005) or [Click Here](http://help.aol.co.uk/account-questions/article/20060627121509990005).

If you do provide a third party's payment details to pay for a Service - for example, you provide the payment details of a partner or a friend to pay - we may disclose your name and address and information to them relating to payments made in relation to your Web Services Account. 

For marketing purposes, we may provide your Personal Information (including contact details) to other companies whose products and AOL Web Services may be of interest to you. For more information about your choices, please see Principle 3. 

#### Principle 5

**We do not read your private online communications.**

AOL honours the confidentiality of your private online communications in private chat rooms, email (including downloads), and Instant Message conversations. AOL does not read, or disclose to third parties, private communications when you use the AOL Web Services, without your consent, except where we or an affiliate processing your data on our behalf is compelled to do so by law, or in response to a valid, legally compliant request by a competent authority, or during emergencies when we believe physical safety is at risk. 

Of course, what you write or post in public or member chat rooms and message boards is available to the public. 

#### Principle 6

**We use secure technology, privacy protection controls and restrictions on employee access in order to safeguard your Personal Information.**

We use technology and other means to help keep your Personal Information, including your Web Services Account information and any payment details you may provide to us, as safe it reasonably can be. We also have put in place privacy protection control systems designed to help ensure that your Personal Information remains safe and private. 

To help protect the information you provide to we may use a variety of safeguards, including: 

  * technical, administrative, and physical controls (such as restricted access facilities, intrusion prevention and detection systems, and dedicated security personnel and incident response teams)
  * encryption and authentication systems 
  * passwords, and other methods including Account Security Questions and 
  * agreements with contractors and vendors requiring them to protect the confidentiality, safety, and security of your information



Each and every AOL employee must comply with the AOL Privacy Policy. AOL authorises its employees to obtain access your Personal Information only to perform their particular functions, and uses technological and other control procedures to help limit such access. Employees who violate our policies and practices are subject to disciplinary action, up to and including dismissal, or prosecution where appropriate. 

AOL Group Companies may use other third parties in order to help operate the AOL Web Services. We require such third parties that have access to your Personal Information to protect this information in a manner consistent with this Privacy Policy and otherwise in accordance with applicable law. 

AOL has established these safeguards to help prevent unauthorised access to or misuse of your Personal Information, but cannot guarantee that your Personal Information will never be disclosed in a manner inconsistent with this Privacy Policy (for example, as a result of unauthorised acts by third parties that violate applicable law or AOL's policies). 

There are many ways for you to access the AOL Web Services, including through high speed and wireless connections - please see your own provider for details. 

We offer you a robust set of tools to help you prevent others from gaining access to your Personal Information, as well as to help protect against other threats to the security of your online experience. To learn what you can do to help safeguard your safety, security, and privacy, please visit [http://help.aol.co.uk/help-safety](http://help.aol.co.uk/help-safety/). 

#### Principle 7

**We take extra steps to protect the safety and privacy of children.**

Young people need special safeguards and privacy protection. We realise they may not understand all the provisions of our policy or be able to make thoughtful decisions about the choices available to adult members. So we have special privacy practices to protect kids using areas on the service specifically designed for them. We urge all parents to educate their children about online safety and the need to protect their Personal Information. 

In areas of the AOL Web Services which may be designed for children 14 and under, AOL and its partners require parental consent (for example, by sending in a permission form by regular mail or by fax) to collect or use names, addresses, telephone numbers or other information that identifies a child offline. 

In areas of the AOL Web Services which may be designed for teens aged 13 to 17, AOL and its partners may not collect names, addresses, telephone numbers or other Personal Information of anyone under the age of 14 without disclosing how that information will be used. 

If you have further queries in relation to your personal data, you may email [datainfouk@aol.com](mailto:datainfouk@aol.com).
