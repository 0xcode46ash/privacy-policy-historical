# Privacy policy

If information is being gathered about you, I believe you have a right to know.

AssociatePrograms.com does not collect information on its website visitors such as names, addresses, telephone numbers, or email addresses - unless you specifically give AssociatePrograms.com that information.

AssociatePrograms.com does not sell or otherwise make available email addresses to anyone except Dundee.net, which distributes the Associate Programs Newsletter. The Dundee people are OK - they won't sell or share such data.

 **Associate Programs Forum**

When you post a message on the Associate Programs Forum your IP number is collected automatically. Cookies are used to recognize you when you return. 

If you post anything illegal, tell deliberate lies, or totally ignore the forum guidelines, we may be tempted to post your IP number on the board. In all the years the forum has been online, we've done that only once.

The forum is intended for use by adults interested in affiliate marketing. WeÂ occasionally ban malicious trouble-makers who pollute the global village. Most participants are friendly and helpful.
