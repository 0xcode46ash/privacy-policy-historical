# ASCO - Privacy Policy

Keeping the information you choose to share with us through the ASCO.org web site (the “Site”) secure and ensuring your understanding of how we use and maintain your information is important to ASCO. ASCO maintains physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect visitor information and while no data transmission over the Internet is 100% secure from intrusion, we have used and will continue to use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the protection for your information. We continually assess new technology for protecting information and, when appropriate, upgrade our information security systems. 

This Privacy Policy discloses our privacy practices, designed to inform you as to: 

  * the kinds of information ASCO collects from visitors of the Site and how that information is collected; 
  * how the information is used by ASCO; 
  * whether ASCO discloses user information to third parties; 
  * how you can access, update or delete any information collected about you by ASCO; and 
  * the mechanisms we have implemented to protect your personal information. 

  
We collect information about you when you visit and use the Site, and particularly when you enter or input information, whether during the course of entering, initiating, fulfilling and transmitting information or otherwise in connection with your general activities and/or use of the Site. 

You can visit this site and learn about ASCO, our related products and services, and find out how to contact us without giving us any personal information about yourself. In general, for purposes of this Privacy Policy, when we use the term “your information” or similar terms, we mean information personally identifiable with a specific visitoror about a visitor’s current or former relationship with ASCO or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates. 

Although we may track the numbers of visitors to the Site to inform us on how best to update the Site and enhance the experience for such visitors, personally identifiable information is not extracted in this process. We use such information on an aggregated basis to help us operate the site, enhance and improve our service, improve the look of the site and display advertising and marketing information. We may use the information you provide us to tailor your experience at our Site, to display content we think may be of interest you, or to let us customize what you see when you visit the Site according to your preferences. If we request that you provide us with personally identifiable data, we will give you the opportunity to “opt out” of receiving future communications from us. 

The personal information you provide and any data, personal or otherwise, that you disclose and which may be saved on the Site is used to provide the Service to you. Sometimes we may use that information to advise you of products or services that may be available through ASCO or its affiliates.Such information and data will also be used to administer our business, the Site, and our services in a manner consistent with the Terms of Use that govern your use of the Site as well as all applicable laws, rules, regulations and other legal obligations. We do not sell or market your personal information or personalized data to unaffiliated organizations. If you provide us with your e-mail address, we may occasionally send you e-mail and any e-mail sent to us by you through the Site will be handled and maintained in accordance with the legal and regulatory requirements we must comply with, if any, regarding communications from clients and the public. 

If you are submitting personally identifiable information on behalf of others in your business for registration purposes or otherwise, you represent that you have their permission, agreement and full authorization to provide this information to us for these purposes. We reserve the right to ask you to provide evidence of that at any time during, or even after, the submission process or to contact those individuals to confirm this at any time. If we determine that such authorization has not been properly obtained, we may immediately and without notice, discontinue your authorized use of those features of the Site for which you have registered.

ASCO collects and uses certain information to service our visitors. This allows us to save you time and money and to better understand your needs. It also helps us help you learn more about ASCO’s products and services that may be of interest. 

While information is critical to our ability to provide high quality service to you, our most important asset is the trust that our visitors place in how we provide that service. Keeping visitor information secure, and using it only as our visitors would want us to, is a top priority for all of us at ASCO. Consequently, our privacy standards are designed to ensure that we will: 

  * collect and use only the minimum necessary information required for us to deliver high quality service to visitors, to administer our business and to let you know of products and services that are available from our family of companies; 
  * protect the information our visitors share with us, maintaining strict standards of security and confidentiality; 
  * require any other organization that we retain or engage to provide support services for us to conform to our privacy standards; and 
  * make every effort to keep visitor files, if any, complete, up to date, and accurate. 

  
Although your privacy is very important to us, in this legal and technical environment, we cannot fully ensure that your personally identifiable information will not be disclosed to third parties. For example, we may be compelled to disclose your information to a governmental agency or a court; or third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications. Additionally, we may (and you authorize us to do so) disclose any information about you to private entities, law enforcement or other government officials as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate to investigate or resolve possible problems or inquiries or to protect our own business and assets. In such circumstances, we will, where possible, require such third parties to maintain the confidentiality of any information so disclosed. 

The Site may contain links to web sites and services owned or maintained by third parties. We are not responsible for and have no control over the privacy and data collection policies and practices implemented by such third parties, some of which may be substantially different from our corresponding policies and practices. ASCO has no obligation and is not liable for the treatment or maintenance of any information, content, data or materials transmitted, distributed or otherwise provided by you via any such third party sites or services.It is your sole responsibility to review their respective policies and practices and determine whether the same are adequate.
