### Privacy Policy Generally

> ASCAP is committed to respecting your privacy and recognizes your need for appropriate protection and management of personally identifiable information that you may share with ASCAP (i.e., any information by which you can be identified, such as name, address, and telephone number).
> 
> In general, you can visit ASCAP without telling us who you are or revealing any personal information about yourself. We may at times track the Internet address of the domains from which people visit us and analyze this data for trends and statistics, but the individual user remains anonymous.

> However, there may be times when we seek to collect personal information from you. It is our intent to inform you before we do that and to tell you what we intend to do with the information. You will have the option not to provide the information, and in the future you will be able to "opt out" of certain uses of the information. If you choose not to provide the information we request, you can still visit most of ASCAP's Site, but you may be unable to access certain options, offers, and services or certain secure pages used for licensee reporting and payment and accessing and sending other information. 
> 
> ASCAP may selectively provide certain information to other companies or organizations whose products or services we think may interest you. If you do not want the information you provide to ASCAP to be shared with other companies and you indicate this preference when you provide the information to ASCAP, we will honor your preference.
> 
> ASCAP is not responsible for the content or privacy practices of third-party Web sites to which this Site may link or may be linked.
