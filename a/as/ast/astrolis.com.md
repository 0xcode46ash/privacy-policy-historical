# Privacy Policy

This website may use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. For session ID cookies, once you close your browser or log out, the cookie terminates and is erased. A persistent cookie is a small text file stored on your computer's hard drive for an extended period of time. Your browser's help file contains information and instructions for removing persistent cookies. Session ID cookies may be used to track user preferences while the user is visiting the website. They also help to minimise load times and save on server processing. Persistent cookies may be used to store, for example, whether or not you want your favorite birth details remembered, or other such information. Cookies used on the Astrolis web site do not contain personally identifiable information. 

**Log Files**  
Like most standard Websites, this web site uses log files. This information may include internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. However, none of the information stored in the log files, including but not limited to IP addresses, is linked to personally identifiable information. 

**How this information is used**  
Astrolis may use the personally identifiable information collected to contact customers regarding products and services offered by Astrolis, to the extent the User has agreed to it, by its trusted affiliates, independent contractors and business partners. Astrolis may also use this information for research purposes regarding the effectiveness of Website services, marketing, advertising and sales efforts. Astrolis will not in any way share this information with a third party either for free or by selling it, unless you specifically authorize such disclosures. 

**Disclosure of Information**  
Astrolis may also disclose aggregate, anonymous, data based on information collected from Users to investors and potential partners. In such cases, statistical information only will be disclosed and personally identifiable data will be kept strictly confidential. In case Astrolis is sold, the information collected from users may be transferred to the new owners. 

Astrolis may from time to time engage third parties, including its own subsidiaries and affiliated companies, to preserve, analyze or otherwise store or manipulate data received by Astrolis from their customers. In all such cases, such third party service providers will be required to treat all such data with the same degree of care and they will be prohibited from disclosing such data to any other person or party, except as otherwise provided for in this Privacy Policy. 

**Special Offers and Updates**  
Astrolis customers and users will occasionally receive information on products, services, special deals, and possibly a newsletter. Out of respect for the privacy of users, Astrolis present the option to not receive these types of communications. 

**3rd Party Advertising**  
We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our Website. These companies may use information (not including your name, address email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, [click here](http://www.networkadvertising.org/). 

**Service Announcements**  
On rare occasions it is necessary to send out a strictly service related announcement, if, for instance, a service is temporarily suspended for maintenance. Generally, users may not opt-out of these communications, though they can deactivate their account. However, these communications are not promotional in nature. 

**Legal Disclaimer**  
Though every effort is made to preserve your privacy, Astrolis may need to disclose personal information when required to by law. If it is deemed necessary that such action needs to be taken, Astrolis will comply with judicial proceedings should a court order or legal process be served. The Astrolis web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that Astrolis are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. You are encouraged to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information. The Privacy Policy as described herein applies solely to information collected by Astrolis. 

**Maintenance of Information**  
The information provided to Astrolis is saved indefinitely and may be stored on one or more databases directly or indirectly maintained by Astrolis. Astrolis employ industry standard security measures to protect the confidentiality of the information. Although Astrolis cannot guarantee that any loss, misuse or alteration of data will not occur; every effort is made to prevent such occurrences. Any other particularly sensitive information, such as payment details collected for commercial transactions, is encrypted prior to transmission by you to Astrolis. 

**Your Responsibility**  
Always remember to log out after your session ends, to ensure that others cannot access your private personal information. You should take this precaution even if you are not using a public computer, such as at a library or internet caf√©, but even when using your private computer in your home.
