**Welcome to the Privacy Policy for Astro Gaming, Inc.**

**Our Commitment To Privacy**  
Astro Gaming, Inc. respects your privacy. This notice explains how Astro Gaming collects and uses information through the Astro Gaming website at [http://www.astrogaming.com](http://www.astrogaming.com/) ( the “Website”) and related services (together with the Website, the “Astro Gaming Offerings”) and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used (the “Privacy Policy”). Throughout this Privacy Policy, we may refer to Astro Gaming, Inc. as “Astro Gaming,” “use,” or “we.” “You” will refer to you and any other user of the Astro Gaming Offerings. We will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.

This Privacy Policy is considered part of our Terms of Use, and your use of the Astro Gaming Offerings is subject to both the Terms of Use, available on the Website, and this Privacy Policy. We reserve the right to change this Privacy Policy at any time. If we change this Privacy Policy, we will provide notification of the change at least thirty (30) business days before the change takes effect. This notice applies to all information collected or submitted on or through the Astro Gaming Offerings.

**The Information We Collect**  
We may require people who use or access the Astro Gaming Offerings (each, a “User”) to enter certain information about themselves, depending on what features of the Astro Gaming Offerings such User uses. For instance, if you order a product from us, we may ask for your mailing address so we can send the requested goods to you, and we may also occasionally send you other materials in the mail. We ask for your email address when you request to join our email mailing list and when you purchase a product so that we may email you updates on your order’s progress. We may also ask for additional information, and will indicate whether such additional information is required to use the Astro Gaming Offerings or if it is optional. If such additional information is optional, you may opt out of providing additional information by not entering it on the Astro Gaming website. You may change the information we have on file about you at any time by emailing us at customerservice [at] astrogaming.com with your request. Regardless of the above, we will never store credit card numbers at Astro Gaming. All payments are processed through a third-party processor and the information you submit to or through such third-party is governed by and subject to such third-party’s terms of use; we take no responsibility or liability for any transaction you may have with any such third party.

“Personally Identifiable Information” is any piece of information which can be traced back to a specific individual user and thus potentially be used to uniquely identify, contact, or locate that specific individual. Examples of Personally Identifiable Information include names, telephone numbers, social security numbers, and other unique identifiers. In no event will Astro Gaming sell or transfer Personally Identifiable Information to third parties, or otherwise provide third parties with access thereto, except as specifically provided in this Privacy Policy and/or in our Terms of Use.

Non-personally identifiable information is information that, by itself, cannot be tracked to a specific individual. Examples of non-personally identifiable information include, but are not limited to, the type of internet browser you are using, the type of computer operating system you are using, your IP address, the time and date of your use of the Astro Gaming Offerings, and whether or not you clicked on hypertext links within the Astro Gaming website. We may collect non-personally identifiable information while you use the Astro Gaming Offerings.

**The Way We Use Information**  
Astro Gaming uses the information we collect to operate, maintain, improve, and provide to our users and customers the Astro Gaming Offerings. We may also use the information to contact users to send communications such as promotion and event announcements regarding Astro Gaming or our partners. We may also e-mail a customer newsletter and updates about the Astro Gaming Offerings or Astro Gaming. You can opt out of receiving these communications at any time by e-mailing us at customerservice [at] astrogaming.com. You may not be able to opt out of all information sharing, however, such as information sharing with other websites and their credit card processors when you elect to purchase a product from such third party website by clicking on a link within the Astro Gaming Offerings.

Astro Gaming does not process orders or credit cards directly. When you elect to purchase a product from within the Astro Gaming Offerings, and click on the link for such product purchase, you will be taken to the website of the third party offering such product for sale. Astro Gaming takes no responsibility for any such third party or their website, privacy practices, billing practices, or any other aspect of the business of such third party. Once you click on a link to a third-party website, your use of their website will be governed by their policies, and you will have to contact such third-party website directly in order to opt out of any notifications that may be sent by such third-party.

Astro Gaming may also collect non-personally identifiable information from users of the Astro Gaming Offerings. Such information may be used to help diagnose technical problems and to administer the Astro Gaming Offerings to constantly improve quality. Astro Gaming may also track and analyze non-identifying and aggregate usage and volume statistical information from visitors and users and provide such information to third parties. If we provide any non-personally identifiable information to others, we will provide such information in the aggregate only and will not include any personally identifiable information about any individual users. We may also use the non-personally identifiable information to generate statistics that we may provide to you and to other businesses using the Services, including, for example, the number of appointments in a certain time period. We also may provide non-personally identifiable information to contractors so that they can perform services for us.

If Astro Gaming is acquired by or merges into another company, the acquiring company will obtain all the information held by Astro Gaming but will be required to continue to comply with this Privacy Policy as it may be updated from time to time.
