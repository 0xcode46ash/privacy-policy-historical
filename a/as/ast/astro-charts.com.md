> **IP Addresses**  
>  Essential Astrology uses IP addresses (random numbers assigned to individual computers) to help diagnose problems with our servers, administer our Web site and anonymously track content preferences and traffic patterns. 
> 
> **Security of your Personal Information**  
>  Essential Astrology is committed to protecting the security of your personal information. We use a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect your personal information from unauthorised access, use, or disclosure. For example, we store the personal information you provide on computer systems with limited access that are located in controlled facilities. When we transmit highly confidential information (such as a credit card number) over the Internet, we protect it with encryption, such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol. 
> 
> **Usage tracking**  
>  Essential Astrology tracks user traffic patterns throughout the sites in the Essential Astrology portfolio and this information is correlated with data about individual users. Overall usage statistics, according to a user's domain name, browser type and MIME type retrieved by reading this information from the browser string (information contained in every user's browser), are also broken down.

> Essential Astrology also tracks and catalogues the search terms that customers enter into our search tools, but this tracking is never associated with individual users. Essential Astrology uses any information voluntarily given by our users to enhance their experience in our network of sites, whether to provide interactive or personalised elements on the sites or to better prepare future content based on the interests of our users.

> We use tracking information to determine which areas of our sites users like and don't like based on traffic to those areas. Essential Astrology does not track what individual users read, but rather how well each page performs overall. This helps us continue to build a better service for you. We track search terms entered in our search function as one of many measures of what interests our users. However, we do not track which terms a particular user enters.
