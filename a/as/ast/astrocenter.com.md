# Privacy Policy - Astrocenter.com

   
**Astrocenter Privacy Policy** | previous page   
  
   
   
  
Astrocenter.com, Inc. ("we" or "Astrocenter") has created this privacy policy to demonstrate our commitment to privacy. We realize the importance of feeling safe online and want you to feel comfortable using our personalized services and exchanging information on our web site. We are committed to protecting your personal information and will take reasonable steps to see that this privacy policy is followed within our company. This statement below outlines the privacy practices for Astrocenter.com and is incorporated into and subject to the terms and conditions of our Terms of Service. 

**I. INFORMATION COLLECTED**  
In order to provide you with personalized services and features we ask you to register and establish your personal profile. During the registration process we will ask you for information such as your name, gender, birth information, e-mail address, password, place of residence, zip code, etc. This information is used to calculate an accurate horoscope or biorhythm and to provide you with the best possible personalized service. Your e-mail address together with a password is used to secure your profile and to make our personalized e-mail services available to you. We collect non-personally identifiable information about you in a number of ways, including tracking your activities on our site through your IP address or most-recently-visited URL. However, we do not collect any personally identifiable information about you unless you voluntarily submit such information to us, by using our products and services or by filling out a form or survey. 

Personally identifiable information is collected primarily to make it easier and more rewarding for you to use our services. Depending on the part of the service you are accessing, you could be asked at various times to provide information such as name, gender, e-mail address, birth date, and birth location. Customers who personalize our service come back regularly, so we do everything we can to make Astrocenter.com your service and give you just the content you wish to receive. The Astrocenter web site is not targeted toward, nor intended for use by, children under the age of 13. Therefore, children under 13 will not be permitted to register and establish a personal profile on the Astrocenter web site. 

**II. USE OF INFORMATION**  
Demographic and profile data, as well as your registration data (i.e., e-mail address, gender, and password) is used to personalize our service to your interests and to deliver personalized information to you. For example, we may decide to use personally identifiable and non-personally identifiable information for internal marketing purposes, for trend analysis, to better understand patterns of usage, and for site administration. Demographic and profile data is shared with our advertisers only on an aggregate basis. We might also share aggregated non-individually identifiable information about our users with our business partners. Aggregated data helps our advertisers to tailor their services to the collective characteristics of Astrocenter.com users. As a general practice, we will not disclose any personally identifiable information to third parties unless you give us your prior express consent. However, due to the existing legal regulatory and security environment, we cannot fully ensure that your private communications and other personally identifiable information will not be disclosed to third parties under certain circumstances. For example, we may be forced to disclose information to the government or third parties under court order, subpoena, or other circumstances, or third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications. Additionally, in the unlikely event we need to investigate or resolve possible problems or inquiries, we can (and you authorize us to do so) disclose any information about you to private entities, law enforcement or other government officials as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate. In instances where we ask for your personally identifiable information and you are notified that the information we are collecting on that page will be shared with third parties, and in cases where you opt-in to share your information with third parties, those disclosures and opt-ins will override anything to the contrary in this privacy policy.
