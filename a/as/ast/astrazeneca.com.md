AstraZeneca UK Limited (“AstraZeneca”) is a company incorporated in England and is a member of the AstraZeneca group of companies (“the Group” and the terms “we” and “us” shall be construed accordingly). The Group includes AstraZeneca plc, AstraZeneca AB, and their associated companies from time to time.

AstraZeneca takes very seriously the privacy of its web site users and the security of their personal information. AstraZeneca is responsible for the processing of all personal information which you provide to us on this site and is registered in England under the Data Protection Act 1998 as a data controller.

The purpose of this statement is to set out the principles governing our use of personal information which we may obtain about you. By using this web site or by registering as a user of the services provided by AstraZeneca you agree to this use. We ask you to read this privacy policy carefully. Any dispute which may arise over privacy will be subject to this policy, the data protection notice (if any) incorporated into the site and the provisions of English law.

We may change our privacy policy from time to time. We therefore ask you to check it occasionally to ensure that you are aware of the most recent version.

1 Aggregate Information

In common with many commercial organisations AstraZeneca monitors the use of its web sites and collects aggregate information to monitor the use of the site. No personally identifiable data are collected in this process. Typically, we collect information about the number of visitors to the site, to each web page and the originating domain name of the visitor's Internet Service Provider. This information is used to understand the visitor's use of the web site and may be shared with the Group and other third parties.

2 Personal Information

Where you are required to register in order to use the website, AstraZeneca will collect personally identifiable information about you, such as your first name, last name, e-mail address and country of residence and other information which you voluntarily submit as part of the registration process. You can modify or delete the information you have provided upon first registration by contacting us at any time by e-mail to [infomaster@astrazeneca.com](mailto:infomaster@astrazeneca.com)

We may obtain sensitive personal information about you, for example, information relating to your mental or physical health - but only if you voluntarily provide us with this information. We may also obtain information about your opinions if you, for example, send us feedback, or ask us questions.

Information that you provide or that is obtained by AstraZeneca will be used by the Group to enable us to review, develop and improve the services we offer and to enable us to provide you and other users with relevant information through our marketing and information programmes. We may contact you about products and services (including those of other companies and organisations) which we consider may be of interest to you or match your registration details or requirements. If you do not wish to receive details through our marketing and information programme you can easily opt-out of receiving further information from us by notifying us at any time by e-mail to [infomaster@astrazeneca.com](mailto:infomaster@astrazeneca.com)

To enhance the features of the site we may share information about you with the following: (a) other companies in the Group; (b) employees, service providers and agents of the Group to administer any products and services provided to you by the Group now or in the future; and (c) anyone to whom we transfer or may transfer our rights and duties under our agreement (if any) with you. In addition we may provide information about you if we have a duty or legal obligation to do so, for example, if we are required to do so by our auditors or if we receive a court order.

AstraZeneca stores personal data on a secure server which is password protected and shielded from the outside world by a firewall.

Links to other web sites are provided as a service to visitors. This privacy policy does not apply to those sites. AstraZeneca does not endorse, sponsor or recommend these sites and does not take responsibility for the data policies or procedures or the content of such linked sites. Please see our disclaimer (accessible on the Home Page) for more information.

For reasons such as improving personalization of our service, we might receive information about you from other sources and add it to the information which we already hold about you. Under the Data Protection Act 1998, you have a right to request access to personal data which are held about you upon payment of a small fee. You also have a right to require inaccuracies to be corrected, which is provided at no charge.

Cookies are small files which are sent to your browser and stored on your computer's hard disk. These are sometimes created and transferred to your hard disk upon first registration at a site. They are subsequently used to identify your computer and allow you repeated access to the site without having to register each time. The cookie is used purely to speed up your access to the site and the information you wish to see. The majority of web browsers accept cookies, but you can usually change the browser settings to prevent the transfer. However if you do so some functionality may be lost.

We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. They have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes.

AstraZeneca web sites are directed at an adult audience (such as healthcare professionals, investors and individuals seeking information about AstraZeneca and healthcare products). We do not knowingly collect information from or about children.

AstraZeneca may use visitor information to investigate and help prevent unlawful activity or activity that threatens the network or otherwise jeopardises the provision of the site.

AstraZeneca welcomes feedback and questions on this policy. If for any reason you wish to contact us please send an e-mail to [infomaster@astrazeneca.com](mailto:infomaster@astrazeneca.com)
