## AstraZeneca’s Binding Corporate Rules

AstraZeneca has ensured compliance with some of its legal obligations in relation to your personal data in some countries by creating a set of “binding corporate rules”. These binding corporate rules set out AstraZeneca’s data privacy commitments in respect of personal data that is transferred internationally from AstraZeneca affiliates in the European Economic Area (the “EEA”) (and countries with similar restrictions on the use of personal data).  
AstraZeneca’s binding corporate rules have been approved by a number of national privacy regulators and, in countries where they apply, require AstraZeneca to: (i) use personal data for specified purposes; (ii) take steps to ensure that the personal data that it holds is kept accurate and up-to-date; and (iii) take appropriate measures against the risks of unlawful use and accidental loss or destruction of, or damage to, personal data. You can find out more about these commitments in the AstraZeneca Global Data Privacy Policy (please click [here](http://www.astrazeneca.com/cs/Satellite?blobcol=urldata&blobheader=application%2Fpdf&blobheadername1=Content-Disposition&blobheadername2=MDT-Type&blobheadervalue1=inline%3B+filename%3DData-privacy.pdf&blobheadervalue2=abinary%3B+charset%3DUTF-8&blobkey=id&)) and is binding on all AstraZeneca staff. The binding corporate rules, and any rights arising under them, do not apply to personal data originating in the USA.

Where your personal data is transferred in the circumstances described above, you have rights under the binding corporate rules to ensure We do the following:

  * **Transparency** : We will provide you with information about how We process your personal data to the extent necessary to ensure that processing is fair. Some of that information is set out above.
  * **Access** : As described in the “Access and Corrections” section above, you may ask AstraZeneca for access to the personal data that AstraZeneca holds about you and AstraZeneca will take steps to provide you with access to the personal data you have requested, although AstraZeneca may not be able to provide you with all the information you ask for.
  * **Rectification and deletion** : As described in the “Access and Corrections” section above, you may ask AstraZeneca in writing to rectify, amend, delete, or suspend the use of, the personal data that AstraZeneca holds about you where that personal data is inaccurate or used in breach of the binding corporate rules. Except in certain circumstances and subject to applicable law, AstraZeneca will comply with that request;
  * **Right of objection** : As described in the “Access and Corrections” section above, you may object to the collection, retention or use of your personal data by AstraZeneca if there are compelling legitimate grounds. You may also object to your use of personal data for marketing purposes using the process set out in the section headed “Opting out of further communications from us” above; and
  * **Automated Processing** : In the unlikely circumstances that we process information about you on a purely automated basis that has a significant impact on you, we shall give you the opportunity to discuss the output of such processing before making those decisions (save to the extent otherwise permitted under applicable law).



Depending on your circumstances and location, you may be able to enforce your privacy rights using the binding corporate rules through one of the regulators who has approved the binding corporate rules or through an English court or a court in your jurisdiction. You are also entitled to obtain a copy of the binding corporate rules upon request, in order that you can see the mechanism by which We ensure that We protect your information and give you enforceable rights. We may redact some commercially sensitive information from the copy of the binding corporate rules We give to you.

As part of the binding corporate rules agreement, We have also agreed that where you can show you have a case against Us, We shall have the burden of proving that We have complied with the binding corporate rules. Before exercising those rights We request that you contact Us in the manner described in the ‘How to Contact Us’ section below so that We can try to address your concerns.

## How To Contact Us
