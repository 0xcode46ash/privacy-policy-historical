# AstraZeneca International - Privacy policy

This international website is provided by AstraZeneca. You can contact AstraZeneca by sending an email to theÂ [Infomaster at AstraZeneca](http://www.astrazeneca.com/node/emailtriage.aspx). We take the privacy of our website users and the security of their personal information very seriously. For the purposes of data protection law, AstraZeneca UK Limited is the company that controls the processing of your personal data. 

The purpose of this privacy policy is to set out the principles governing our use of personal information which we may obtain about you. By using this website, or by registering as a user of the services which we provide, you agree to this use. We ask you to read this privacy policy carefully. Any dispute which may arise over privacy will be subject to this policy, the data protection notice (if any) incorporated into this website and the provisions of English law. 

We may change our privacy policy from time to time. We therefore ask you to check it occasionally to ensure that you are aware of the most recent version which will apply each time you access this website. 

1 Aggregate information  
In common with many commercial organisations we monitor the use of this website by collecting aggregate information. No personally identifiable data are collected in this process. Typically, we collect information about the number of visitors to the website, to each web page and the originating domain name of the visitor's Internet Service Provider. This information is used to understand the visitor's use of the website and may be shared with other companies within the AstraZeneca Group and with other third parties.

We may obtain sensitive personal information about you, for example, information relating to your physical or mental health or condition, but only if you voluntarily provide us with this information. We may also obtain information about your opinions if you, for example, send us feedback, or ask us questions.

Occasionally we may receive information about you from other sources which we will add to the information which we already hold about you in order to help us improve and personalise our service to you

We will only use information that we hold about you in accordance with this privacy policy and any data protection notice which we have provided to you. 

We may, from time to time, contact you by email or post with information about our products or services or those of other companies in the AstraZeneca Group, that may be of interest to you (eg news updates). If you do not wish to receive such details you can easily opt-out of receiving further information from us by sending an email to the [Infomaster at AstraZeneca](http://www.astrazeneca.com/node/emailtriage.aspx). You should clearly state your name, username and registration details (if any) and the name of this website on all communications.

  
We store your personal data on a secure server which is password protected and shielded from the outside world by a firewall. We have in place security policies which are intended to ensure, as far as possible, the security and integrity of all our information, including your personal information.   
Cookies are small files which are sent to your web browser and stored on your computer's hard disk. These are sometimes created and transferred to your hard disk upon first registration at a website. They are subsequently used to identify your computer and allow you repeated access to the website without having to log on each time. The cookie is used purely to speed up your access to the website and the information you wish to see. The majority of web browsers accept cookies, but you can usually change the browser settings to prevent the transfer. However, please be aware that, if you do so, some functionality may be lost.   
We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. They may need access to your personal information in order to perform their functions. Rest assured, however, that they may not use your personal information for any other purposes. 

  
Our website is directed at an adult audience (such as health care professionals, investors and individuals seeking information about our company and healthcare products). We do not knowingly collect information from or about children.   
We may use the information we gather and/or receive about you to investigate and help prevent unlawful activity or activity that threatens our network or otherwise jeopardises the provision of this website.
