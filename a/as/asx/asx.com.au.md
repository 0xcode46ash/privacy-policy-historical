We will not try to identify you or your browsing activities except, in the event of an investigation, where a law enforcement agency may exercise a warrant to inspect the service provider's logs or if your usage is causing technical issues for our site which may need to be resolved. We may in these circumstances identify your IP address to enable us to contact you.

### **Cookies**

A 'cookie' is a packet of information that allows ASX to grant users access to certain parts of the ASX Website (the "Site") and also to manage traffic, advertising and other activities. Cookies are generally used on the Site in the following ways:  
1\. To authenticate your access to certain areas of the Site, such as the MyASX section;  
2\. To monitor traffic levels and flows through the Site;  
3\. To manage advertising on the Site; and  
4\. From time to time ASX may conduct surveys on the Site, and cookies may be used to manage this process.

You can configure your browser to accept all cookies, reject all cookies, or notify you when a cookie is sent. (Each browser is different, so check the "Help" menu of your browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences).

If you disable the use of cookies on your web browser or remove or reject specific cookies from this website or linked sites then you may not be able to gain access to all of the content and facilities in this website. 

### **Links to other Sites**

This site contains links to other sites. ASX is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such web sites.

### **Registration for ASX Services**

Some pages of this Internet site provide the facility for you to subscribe to receive information or to register for courses, games or other services. Information provided by you to enable you to receive information or register for courses, including email addresses, will only be used for the purpose for which you have provided it, unless you consent otherwise or we are required to disclose it by law.

### **Collection of Personal Information**

The main way we would collect personal information from you is if you used our site to register for courses or to subscribe to another ASX service. This personal information may include your full name, phone and fax numbers, e-mail address and street and postal address.  
When or before we collect personal information on our web site, we will take reasonable steps to inform you of:

We will take all reasonable steps to allow you to access your personal information and we will correct the information if we are satisfied it is incorrect.

### **Personal Information Quality**

When you provide personal information to us via the Internet, we rely on the accuracy of that information. To assist with ensuring accuracy, please contact us if any of the details you have provided change.

### **Personal Information Storage and Security**

Personal information is stored in transmission logs and archived for a period of up to seven years, depending on the nature of the information being held.  
Where appropriate, our web site provides a secure environment by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). This establishes a session and encrypts all traffic between our web server and your browser.  [More information about MyASX security](https://web.archive.org/web/20090519173229id_/http%3A//www.asx.com.au/about_site.htm#Security).

### **Use and Disclosure of Personal Information**

We will only use your personal information (including your e-mail address) for the purpose for which you have provided it, eg to register for an on-line ASX course, unless you consent otherwise. We may also from time to time email you about an event or new feature that we think might be of interest. If you do not wish to receive such emails, all you have to do is hit the reply button and type "remove" in the subject field of the email.  
We will not disclose your personal information to third parties, unless you consent or in other circumstances where such disclosure is required or authorised by law.  
Contracts we enter into with other parties for the provision of services may require us to disclose your personal information to them.  In those cases, our contracts require other parties providing services to us to observe the terms of this Privacy Statement.
