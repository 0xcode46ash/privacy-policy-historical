# DATA PROTECTION

DATA PROTECTION
Introduction
This prepaid card is brought to you by Card Compact Ltd (CCL), who is committed to protecting your
privacy. All data is collected, transferred, processed and maintained in accordance with the
principles contained within the Data Protection Act 1998 of the United Kingdom and the Privacy and
Electronic Communications (EC Directive) Regulations 2003. We recognise our responsibility to keep
your information confidential and secure. Any personal information about you which we obtain in
connection with your prepaid card registration and eAccount operation, we undertake to keep safe.
We will not share this information with other people or businesses, other than stated in this policy,
without your prior consent.
The following statement explains our policy regarding the personal information we collect about you.
How we collect and use information
To enable us to issue your Prepaid Card and set up your eAccount, we need to obtain information at
registration which includes your name, your e-mail and home addresses, and other relevant
personal details. As a registered user, you have the option to change or revise your personal data
(with the exception of your user name, first name, last name, date of birth and country) at any time.
After logging in to the Website, you may change your information in the Personal Details area.
The information that you provide will only be used by the method and for the purposes described at
the time of your registration and where applicable in the Terms and Conditions that apply to the
relevant product or service. We will also collect, store and process your personal information on our
computers to develop and improve our overall service to you, communicate with you and to manage
your eAccount.
We give access to your personal information only to those employees who require it to provide our
services. If you do not want to receive marketing communication, please log in to your account and
manage your settings for communications. We will not disclose any such information outside of CCL
except in the limited circumstances described below, as permitted by applicable law, or with your
express permission:
 •      To fraud prevention agencies and other organisations who may use the information to
prevent fraud and money laundering, or in order to assist us in investigating suspected violations of
our Terms and Condition
 •      To persons acting as our agents under a strict code of confidentiality
 •      To anyone to whom we transfer or may transfer our rights and duties under our Terms and
Conditions with you
 •      As required by law or regulation
To fulfil some of the above processes we may have to pass your information to other parts of our
group of companies or trusted partners, which may be in other countries within the EU. We will
make sure that they agree to apply the same levels of protection as we are required to apply to
information held in the UK and to use your information only for the purpose of providing the service
to us. We will not transfer your information outside of the EU without prior consent, however if it is
transferred outside the EU, then the same protection will be afforded as that provided within the
EU.


As with any other business, it is possible that CCL in the future could amalgamate or merge with or
be acquired by another company. If such acquisition occurs, the successor company would have
access to the personal information maintained by CCL, including customer eAccount information,
but would continue to be bound by this Privacy Policy unless and until it is amended as described
above.
How we apply our policy
In order to put our policy into practice, we use our best endeavours to follow these guidelines:
 •       We will ensure our systems are secure to protect your personal information from misuse
 •       We will not hold your personal information for longer than is necessary
 •       We will not sell, trade, or rent your personal information to other people or businesses unless
we have your consent; with your consent, we will only share your information with carefully chosen,
reputable and trustworthy third parties
 •       We will comply promptly with any instructions from you to update your information or
requests from you to see the information that we hold on you
 •       We will comply with lawful requests to disclose personal information to certain authorities
(e.g. the police)
 •       We may monitor and record any telephone calls to ensure we follow your instructions
correctly and to improve our service
If you would like a copy of the information we hold about you, please write to: Card Compact
Limited, 483 Green Lanes, London N13 4BS. There will be an administration charge of €10 for this
service.
Security of your personal information
Card Compact is committed to ensuring the protection of your personal information. We employ
various technologies and security measures so that we may ensure the protection of your personal
information and avoid their consultation, their use, or their disclosure without your authorisation.
For example, we stock the information that you provide us in servers with limited access which are
located in supervised installations. When we transmit confidential information on the Internet (a
credit card number, for example), this data is protected by a cryptographic system like the SSL
protocol (Secure Socket Layer).

passed on to the shipping company assigned to the delivery (name, address, poss. telephone
number for confirming delivery dates). To process payments, we pass on the relevant payment data
to our principal banking institution. Your data will not be shared with any additional third parties
nor will it be used for marketing purposes. Upon conclusion of the contract and receiving full


payment, your data will be locked for further processing and deleted after fulfilling tax and trade
law requirements.
Security: Your personal data is encoded and transmitted over the internet using 256-bit SSL
encryption. Our website and other systems are protected by various technical and organizational
measures against the loss, destruction, access, changes or distribution of your data by
unauthorized persons. In spite of regular controls, complete protection against all risks is not
possible.
