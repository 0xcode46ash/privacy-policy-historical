(Effective January 1, 2003)

asaptickets.com Inc. is committed to protecting your privacy while you are visiting our Site.

In order to provide the best in customer service, we may ask you to share "personal information" -- such as your name, address, e-mail address, and phone number. First, we want you to understand our policy regarding the collection and use of your personal information.

**The Personal Information Collected**

You may visit our Site or call our Travel Professionals to search for great travel deals without providing us with any personal information.

**Membership Information**

Membership offers you the flexibility and freedom to complete a travel purchase on our Site at any time, and becoming a member is so easy to do. When you register to become a member, you will be asked to share with us certain basic personal information, such as your name, e-mail address, and password. Should you choose to do so, you can supplement the basics with your credit card number, frequent flyer number, travel preferences, and more. After becoming a member, you can visit or update the personal information in your travel profile at any time. By completing and updating your personal information, you help us tailor our services to better meet your needs.

**Transaction Information**

In order to complete a travel purchase, you will be asked to share with us information required to complete the transaction successfully, such as billing and shipping addresses, credit card number and expiration date, etc.

**Subscription Information**

Even if you`re not a member, you have the opportunity to receive our special travel offers via e-mail. When you sign up for this service, you will be asked to provide us with your e-mail address.

**Contests/Sweepstakes Participation**

You may participate in our contests or sweepstakes without becoming a member, completing a purchase, or subscribing to receive our e-mails. When you enter a contest or sweepstakes, you will be asked to share with us certain personal information.

**How Personal Information Is Used**  
**We will use your personal information in the following ways:**

When you purchase travel products or services, your personal information will be shared with the third parties necessary to successfully complete the transaction -- including the vendors you have selected (for example, airlines, hotels, travel insurance providers, etc.) and others who facilitate the transaction (for example, your credit card company).  
As a member or guest, from time to time, you may receive communications from us or third parties performing services on our behalf, which include: (i) specific information we want to communicate to you regarding your travel requests or arrangements, such as any notification of a flight cancellation; (ii) notifications regarding updates or modifications to our Site; and (iii) details regarding any special offers sponsored by us, such as rewards, rebates, sweepstakes, and gift promotions.  
As a member or subscriber, you may also choose to receive from us, or trustworthy third parties acting on our behalf, special promotions that we believe will be valuable to you, including, without limitation, e-mails promoting special travel deals, sponsored by us or third-party vendors. If you participate in a contest or sweepstakes, your personal information may be used by us, or trustworthy third parties acting on our behalf, to process your entry and fulfill any prize awarded to you.  
From time to time, in an effort to improve our service, we may ask third parties to conduct marketing-research analyses on our behalf and, as such, the information we provide to them is restricted to marketing-research analyses only. Any personal information we provide to such third parties is protected under confidentiality agreements.  
We may disclose your personal information (i) if you violate our Terms of Use or any law, rule, or regulation, or (ii) if required by law or regulatory authority (for example, court order or subpoena).  
In the event that our Company or this Site or certain of our assets are acquired, your personal information may be one of the transferred assets. Use of your personal information by third parties distributing promotions on our behalf shall be subject to our Privacy Policy.

**What We Won`t Do With Personal Information**

We will not sell or rent your personal information to any third parties.

**Security** Security of our customers` personal information is important to us.

As a member, your personal information is password-protected. If you ever forget your password, we will help you create a new one. Remember to log out of your account and close your browser window when you have finished visiting our Site in order to ensure that others cannot access your personal information.

To protect personal information transmitted to us, we use a security system that includes firewall technologies, intrusion detection systems, logical network segmentation, restricted access to stored profile information, and security restrictions to our databases and systems.

**We permit authorized personnel only to access personal information.**

We use industry-standard, secure-socket-layer (SSL) technology, which is utilized by most popular browsers, including Netscape and Microsoft Explorer, to encrypt (or convert into code) your personal information before it is transferred across the Internet. To further safeguard your most sensitive credit card information, we transfer such information across the Internet in an encrypted format and then store such information in our secure database.

Since we do not control transmissions over the Internet, via commercial Internet service providers, and/or the security of your personal computer, we cannot guarantee 100 percent secure transmission via the Internet. Use of the Internet is at your own risk. Also, it is important that you take steps to protect yourself against unauthorized access to your computer and your password.

**Other, Non-Personal Information Collected**

Like many other Internet sites, we automatically collect non-personal information regarding our visitors, such as software client information (for example, IP addresses, browser versions and operating systems) and aggregate information (for example, number of pages accessed) in order to analyze Web traffic and usage trends. Information of this nature does not pertain to your specific identity and is not associated with your personal information.

To enhance your experience on our Site, we and our third-party advertiser(s) commonly employ Internet technologies, such as "cookies," to collect and store non-personal information about our visitors. "Cookies" are small pieces of information that are transferred by a website and stored by your Web browser on your computer`s hard drive. With most browsers, you can set the preferences to show a warning each time a cookie request is received. You can also set the browser not to accept cookies at all; however, we won`t be able to personalize your experience if we cannot recognize you.

Cookies and Web beacons (also called "pixel tags") may be used by us or our third-party advertiser(s) to determine how you reached our Site, to track your usage patterns once you are on our Site, and to target our Internet banner advertisements on our Site and other websites. For more information about our third-party advertiser(s), cookies, and how to opt out, please click here.

**What Is Not Covered By This Privacy Policy**

Except as covered above, this Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices or policies of any companies or entities that we do not own or control, including links to sites that are not maintained by us, or to people that we do not employ or manage. Because these companies or entities may have privacy policies that differ from this Privacy Policy (or no privacy policy at all), please be sure to review their respective privacy policies before providing them with any personal information.

**Questions, Comments or Concerns**

If you have additional questions or concerns regarding our Privacy Policy, please e-mail us at

**Privacy Policy Updates**

We may, in our sole discretion, revise this Privacy Policy at any time; all such revisions shall be effective when posted. If we change the way your personal information will be used, we will post an announcement on our homepage. We encourage you to periodically review this Privacy Policy in order to keep apprised of our current privacy practices. For all customer service related questions, please email us at
