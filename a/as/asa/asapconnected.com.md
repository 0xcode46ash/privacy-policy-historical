We may collect additional information about your interaction with the Site without identifying you as an individual (“Anonymous Information”), by using cookies or other technologies. For example, we may receive certain standard information that your browser sends to every website you visit, such as your IP address, browser and operating system type, and information about the device you are using (such as whether it is a mobile device or a desktop computer). We may use Anonymous Information for any purpose in our discretion. For clarity, Anonymous Information means information that is not associated with or linked to your personal information and does not permit the identification of individual persons.

You can always choose to stop receiving newsletters or other communications from us by clicking the “unsubscribe” link at the bottom of a marketing message.



As with any business, it is possible that in the future we could merge with or be acquired by another company. If this occurs, the successor company would have access to the Information, but would continue to be bound by this Privacy Policy unless and until it is amended. 

### WILL ASA SEND ME TEXT MESSAGES?

At this time we will not send you notifications, alerts or other communications via text message. 

### WHAT ELSE SHOULD I KNOW ABOUT ANONYMOUS INFORMATION COLLECTED BY ASA?

ASA uses an analytics partner (“Analytics Partner”) to collect Anonymous Information about how our Site is used. Our Analytics Partner may use cookies, web beacons or other automated technologies to collect information about how many times you visit our Site, what parts of our Site you access, and what other websites you visit before and after visiting our Site. To help you understand these technologies better: 

  * “Cookies” are electronic files many websites place on a visitor’s computer to store information that makes each visit to a respective website more efficient. To remove cookies, you may configure your browser to clear all cookies, or configure it to reject cookies whenever you visit a new website. Please consult your browser’s user guide for specific instructions on removing cookies.
  * “Beacons” are small graphic files with a unique identifier that are used to track a web or mobile site user’s online movements. Unlike cookies, beacons are embedded on websites, not downloaded on your computer or device.
  * Our Analytics Partner may use these or other techniques to collect Anonymous Information about your visit to our Site. In order to make sure you understand how our Analytics Partner handles your information and how it interacts with our Site, we’ve shared hyperlinks below to its Terms of Use. You should visit this page as ASA has no ability to control or monitor our Analytics Partner’s data collection or data use practices.
  * Google Analytics— ASA partners with Google Analytics to provide insight into our Site. Google Analytics’ terms are available here: http://www.google.com/analytics/terms/us.html.



### HOW DOES ASA PROTECT MY INFORMATION?

ASA uses reasonable administrative, physical and technical safeguards designed to secure the personal information you share with us. Regardless of the precautions taken by us or by you, no data transmitted over the Internet or any other public network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. We cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us and you provide all personal information to us at your own risk. 

### DOES ASA COLLECT PAYMENT CARD INFORMATION?

ASA does not collect credit and debit card information directly through the Site and kindly asks you not to share this information with us when communicating with us by e-mail or submitting requests for additional information. ASA does use a third-party credit card processor (“Payment Processor”) to process online transactions through our online store. Please note that your credit and debit card information (number, expiration date, security code) is provided directly to the Payment Processor and is stored by the Payment Processor and not by us, and as such, it is important to review the Payment Processor’s privacy policy and terms of service to understand their information security practices. The Payment Processor may share with us some of the information you submit in connection with purchases so that we can complete your order, including your name, shipping information, e-mail, phone number, and information about the products you purchase and your online order. Please be advised that we may send you e-mail alerts regarding the status of your purchases and/or to ask for your feedback. 

### CAN I CHOOSE TO STOP RECEIVING COMMUNICATIONS FROM ASA?

You can always choose to stop receiving newsletters or other electronic communications from us by clicking the “unsubscribe” link at the bottom of an ASA message. Please understand that if you choose to unsubscribe from promotional correspondence from us, we may still contact you in connection with your relationship, activities, transactions and/or communications with us. 

### CAN CHILDREN USE THE ASA WEBSITE?

We do not intentionally gather information from individuals who are under the age of 13. Upon notification that a child under 13 has provided us with personal information, we will delete the child’s personal information from our records. 

### WHAT IF I LIVE IN CALIFORNIA?

California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits Site visitors who are California residents and who have provided us with "personal information" (as that term is defined in Section 1798.83) to request certain information about the disclosure of that information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. If you are a California resident, you may contact us by writing to: Administrative Software Applications, 1310 Hollenbeck Ave. Suite C, Sunnyvale, CA 94087. 

### WHAT IF I LIVE OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES?

You should be aware that the United States and other countries have not harmonized their privacy regulations. Because ASA and its servers are located in the United States and our services are directed towards the United States market, our Privacy Policy has been prepared to comply with applicable United States regulations. By accessing and/or using the Site or our services and providing personal information to us through the Site, you agree to the level of privacy protection set out in this Privacy Policy. 

### WHAT IF I LIVE IN CANADA?

Canadian citizens, except under circumstances defined by law, are entitled to access their own personal information collected by ASA by writing to: Administrative Software Applications, 1310 Hollenbeck Ave. Suite C, Sunnyvale, CA 94087. If you believe that the personal information about you that we have collected is incomplete or inaccurate, please contact us and we will correct the information upon verification of the omission or error and of the identity of the person requesting the change. 

### WHAT IF I FOLLOW A LINK TO A THIRD PARTY WEBSITE?

The Site may contain links to other websites. The fact that we link to a website is not an endorsement, authorization or representation of our affiliation with that third party. We do not exercise control over third party websites. These other websites (including our Payment Processor) may place their own cookies or other files on your computer, collect data, or solicit personal information from you. Other sites follow different rules regarding the use or disclosure of the personal information you submit to them. We encourage you to read the privacy policies or statements of the other websites. Please be aware that the terms of our Privacy Policy do not apply to these third party websites. 

### WILL ASA CHANGE THIS PRIVACY POLICY?

Each time you use the Site, the current version of this Privacy Policy will apply. When you use the Site, you should check the date of this Privacy Policy and review any changes since the last version. Visitors can always refuse to accept changes to our Privacy Policy by ending their use of the Site. Unless stated otherwise, our current Privacy Policy applies to all information that we have about you. Continuation of your use of the Site shall be considered acceptance of any changes in the Privacy Policy. 

### HOW DO I CONTACT ASA?
