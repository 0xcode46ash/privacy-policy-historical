9\. Cookie Policy

The ASA website cookie policy has been developed in conjunction with the Interactive Advertising Bureau Cookie initiative ([www.allaboutcookies.org](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/)) to tell users what cookies are used on this site and how to manage them. 

9.1. What is a cookie? 

A cookie is a text-only string that is entered into the cookie file or "memory" of the browser on your computer by website owners and content providers. It will typically contain the name of the domain from which the cookie has come, the "lifetime" of the cookie, and a value, usually a randomly generated unique number. Two types of cookies are used on this website – session cookies which are temporary cookies that remain in the cookie file of your browser until you close your browser, and persistent cookies which remain in the cookie file of your browser for much longer (though how long will depend on the "lifetime" of the specific cookie).
