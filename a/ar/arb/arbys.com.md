# Arby's Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy shall be effective as of May 10, 2006.

###### PRIVACY POLICY

Welcome to the Arby's Restaurant Group, Inc. ("Arby's") www.arbys.com web site ("web site" or "site"). 

This Privacy Policy is designed to explain Arby's on-line information practices regarding this web site. The Privacy Policy describes how Arby's collects, uses and shares personally identifiable information ("PII") and other "non-PII" information obtained from and about individuals who visit this site. The internet presents an opportunity for us to reach our audience in new and exciting ways with product information, company information, and activities such as sweepstakes, contests and other promotions. We are committed to providing and maintaining that opportunity in a safe and secure environment for our visitors.

###### Agreement To this Privacy Policy and Privacy Policy Modifications

By using this web site you are agreeing to this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with this Privacy Policy, or any of its terms, please do not provide your personally identifiable information ("PII"), for example, your name, address, telephone number, screen name, email address or credit card information. From time to time, and at any time, this Privacy Policy may be revised or changed. We will notify you about material changes and their effective date in the way we treat PII by sending a notice to the primary email address you have specified or by placing a prominent notice on the site. Web site users should review this Privacy Policy periodically to be up to date on our most current privacy policies and practices.

###### Collection of Your Personal Identifiable Information ("PII") and Other Personal Information

This web site is intended to provide a unique and entertaining experience for users, without requiring them to submit any more PII than is necessary to participate in particular activities which may be offered, or to use the site effectively. We do not require users to register or submit PII in order to visit the web site and most activities on the site can be performed without supplying PII. When we ask for PII to participate in an activity we will not require anyone to disclose more PII than we believe is reasonably necessary to participate in the activity. At times, users may be asked to provide non-PII such as first name, age, gender, zip code, city, and/or state of residence.

###### For Children Under the Age of 13

Children under the age of 13 RECEIVE SPECIAL PROTECTIONS. We will not knowingly accept information from children under the age of 13 and if we were to run any special promotions for this group, it would only be in accordance with special rules and a separate Privacy Policy that we would disclose at that time.

###### When PII and Non-PII May be Requested

Registration or input of PII may be required to participate in activities such as sweepstakes, contests, specific promotional activities, surveys, or for e-commerce. If PII is requested for participation in an activity, you cannot participate without disclosing the requested PII. From time to time, we may also ask you to provide us with non-PII which does not allow us to identify you by email address, full name or full address. We may use this information for internal purposes, or for creating reports for ourselves and third party advertisers and partners.

###### Use of PII

We may use PII in sweepstakes, contests or promotional activity (i) to register you for those activities, to verify that you comply with the published rules and to notify you if you are a winner, (ii) for coupon, premium or prize delivery, (iii) for notification of special offers; and (iv) to ensure that we comply with applicable laws. The PII you disclose for these and similar activities may be shared with third parties, such as those who may administer the activity for us, and shipping companies who may deliver a prize or premium. We will inform you at the time we are collecting the PII that such collection is a requirement for participation.

We may also use your PII for the following purposes: (v) to personalize and enhance our site and your web site experience; (vi) to send you personalized information about our site via email, (vii) to send you advertising or promotional material from us, our advertisers or business partners; and (viii) to contact you for feedback regarding us, our advertisers or business partners. 

Should you respond to a particular offer from our business partners or advertisers we may also use your PII to provide a report to our advertisers or business partners that tells them who responded to a particular offer. Further if you accept an offer contained in, for example an email, we may provide the advertiser or business partner with the PII necessary to fulfill that offer to you.
