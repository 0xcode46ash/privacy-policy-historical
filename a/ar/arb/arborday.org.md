# The National Arbor Day Foundation

As a visitor to our web site, it is your right to know if personal information about our visitors is being collected. As a national non-profit foundation committed to providing helpful information about planting and caring for trees, we can assure you that we take our responsibility to safeguard your privacy very seriously. 

**Opt-in Newsletters.**  
There are two instances where we retain web visitor information. The first area is when a user voluntarily elects to receive our e-mail newsletters. E-mail newsletter subscriptions can be added or canceled at any time. This can be done in the "My Account" section under the "More" tab. Your e-mail address will never be shared, loaned or sold to any other group, individual or business. We will never give your email address to any third party unless legally required to do so.

**User Accounts.**  
The second way in which information is collected comes into play when a visitor creates a user account on our web site, as is necessary to place an order. When you create your account or whenever you update your account information (name, address, credit card, etc.), you will see that our "secure socket layer" has been activated. This is indicated on many browsers by a small padlock or key icon. These symbols reassure you that your personal information is being transmitted to the Foundation in a secure, encrypted manner. Whether a padlock or key icon is or is not visible, you will note that the address of the checkout page has changed from "http:" to "https:", a further indication that the transaction is secured. This security is certificated by VeriSign, the most prestigious international provider of secure Internet transfer. 

**Cookies.**  
Our shopping system uses temporary cookies to enable you to add items to your shopping cart. No personal data is collected through the use of cookies. [More about that.](https://web.archive.org/web/20060615020825id_/http%3A//www.arborday.org/generalinfo/nocookies.cfm)

**Mail.**  
If you have supplied a postal address online, you may receive periodic mailings from us with information about trees, services or upcoming events. If you do not wish to receive such mailings, please let us know by [ sending us email ](https://web.archive.org/web/20060615020825id_/http%3A//www.arborday.org/generalinfo/index.cfm) or writing to us at the address below. Be sure to provide your exact name and address so we can honor your request. Unless you have indicated that we should not share your name, you may also receive mailings from other reputable organizations from time to time.

**Children.**   
The Foundation has a long-standing commitment to helping children learn about the planting, care and management of trees. Honoring that commitment, this site will continue to present reliable information to young people as well as adults. This information will be presented in a most proper and educational context, and will at no time include references or images that would be inappropriate for children at home or in a classroom setting.
