# The National Arbor Day Foundation - We Help People Plant and Care for Trees

**   
PRIVACY STATEMENT**   
The National Arbor Day Foundation  
……………………………………  
As a visitor to our web site, it is your right to know if personal information about our visitors is being collected. As a national non-profit foundation committed to providing helpful information about planting and caring for trees, we can assure you that we take our responsibility to safeguard your privacy very seriously. 

There are generally three instances where we retain web visitor information. At the most basic level, a visitor comes to the web site, looks at some pages, and leaves. In this instance, we log site activity information which can help us in designing more effective pages. For example, it's helpful for us to know what pages are visited a lot, and what pages are rarely visited. By logging the number of clicks and the pages visited, along with the type of browser used, we can make sure that we are building pages that are interesting, easily readable, and accessible by our visitors.

A second area of security comes into play when you voluntarily provide your e-mail address on our home page or during the order checkout process. These e-mail addresses are kept in a list and used to send you helpful information about trees from time to time. You may request that your e-mail address be removed from the list at any time. Your e-mail address will not be shared, loaned or sold to any other group, individual or business.

The third way in which information is collected comes into play when a visitor to our web site places an order. During the checkout process, when you submit personal information (name, address, credit card, etc.), you will see that our "secure socket layer" has been activated. This is indicated on many browsers by a small padlock or key icon. These symbols reassure you that your personal information is being transmitted to the Foundation in a secure, encrypted manner. Whether a padlock or key icon is or is not visible, you will note that the address of the checkout page has changed from "http:" to "https:", a further indication that the transaction is secured. [](https://digitalid.verisign.com/as2/4922c92db8c5bfb896ed2b9021acf847) This security is certificated by VeriSign, the most prestigious international provider of secure Internet transfer.

If you have supplied a postal address online, you may receive periodic mailings from us with information about trees, services or upcoming events. If you do not wish to receive such mailings, please let us know by [ sending us email ](mailto:member.services@arborday.org) or writing to us at the address below. Be sure to provide your exact name and address so we can honor your request. Unless you have indicated that we should not share your name, you may also receive mailings from other reputable organizations from time to time.

The Foundation has a long-standing commitment to helping children learn about the planting, care and management of trees. Honoring that commitment, this site will continue to present reliable information to youngsters as well as adults. This information will be presented in a most proper and educational context, and will at no time include references or images that would be inappropriate for children at home or in a classroom setting.

Questions regarding our privacy policy and our handling of secure transactions may be directed to [webmaster@arborday.org](mailto:webmaster@arborday.org) or mailed to:
