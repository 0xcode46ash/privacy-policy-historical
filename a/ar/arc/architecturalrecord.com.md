McGraw-Hill Construction Privacy Notice

**Updated August 28, 2008**

When you register on one of our web sites, your personal contact information provided on the registration form (including your name, e-mail address, and fax) is added to an electronic mailing list so that we can fulfill your order and, from time to time, send you product information or news about changes to our web site. In addition, McGraw-Hill Construction may share this data collected about subscribers with:

  * Other units within the family of The McGraw-Hill Companies;
  * Companies outside The McGraw-Hill Companies whose products or services we feel may be of interest to you;
  * Applicable project owners and architects so that they can monitor use of their intellectual property rights in the applicable plans and specifications; 
  * Product manufacturers in order for the manufacturers to follow-up on your requests; and
  * Other businesses in the form of a listing in a directory published by McGraw-Hill Construction that includes your contact information. Directories of this nature are used by other firms to conduct marketing activities.
  * Third party vendors who are authorized to use this information solely to perform service (such as a “mailing” house) on our behalf
