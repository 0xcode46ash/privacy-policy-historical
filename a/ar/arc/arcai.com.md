Site information Privacy policy 

This site collects user data in the form of web server logs.

This information includes a user's source IP address (as witnessed by the web server), 

any information automatically sent by their browser (user agent, referrer, accept languages, accept encodings, , referer links, etc), and record of what resources on this site were requested. 

This information is periodicly reviewed to compound these nifty little things called 'statistics', whereby we derive cool numbers that we can impress our friends with. 

We also use these logs to determine usage, surfing, and mating habits of visitors.

While this information is not sold, it may be provided to someone who provides us a justified reason for needing the information (or threatens some form of legal repercussion against us). 

Note, however, that we also log particular information from kiddies who decide it would be fun to try to discover security vulnerabilities or circumvent existing access control mechanisms on this server.

Any information collected from an individual during the act of an attempted intrusion or precursor activies is fair game to appear in the Honeynet Project's reports, 

or a full disclosure list (aka, we will hork and redistribute any 0day used against us). 

Copyright policy Various information and items on this site carry copyrights of their respective owners (which may not be Arcai.com affiliated).

Known copyrights are indicated were possible. 

If you have a question concerning copyrights or reproduction of material, contact root@arcai.com.

Cookie usage

Contrary to the media's belief, cookies are not all evil. They serve a very useful purpose by providing persistant data. 

Design policy The design follows a general 'design policy' rule of thumb:

Why use Flashy-applets or active-shocking-plugins when you have all of HTML to do what you need.

There are still monks in Tibetan monasteries deep in the mountains who are unable to get DSL and are stuck on 56K dialups;

thus graphics must be small. 

Something should 'rollover' only if it recently died. Hopefully everything is accessible within three clicks, to reduce potential carpal tunnel.

Simple text can be sexy too, if next to a picture of a sexy female. 

A rainbow of intermixed colors should be left for psychodelic hallucinations. 

The arcai.com logo is cool, and therefore must be contained somewhere on the page.

All of these rules are negotiable during situations when a firearm to our head is involved.
