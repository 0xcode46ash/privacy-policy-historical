Privacy Policy  
  
---  
  
Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy we provide this notice explaining our online information practices, including how we collect, use, and safeguard the information you may provide to us on this site, and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used. To make this notice easy to find, we make it available on our homepage and at every point where we request personally identifiable information. This statement may be revised from time to time, so please revisit this page to remain fully informed of our commitment.

This notice applies to all information collected or submitted on our Web sites. To provide you with our services, such as reserving or leasing apartment homes, applying for a job, or signing up for our e-mail alerts, we may request that you provide us personal information including you name, address, e-mail address, phone number, credit/debit card information, employment information, and other such personal information.

In order to personalize and enhance your experience on our Web site, we also may collect information through "cookies." Cookies are small strings of text that are sent by our site to your browser and then stored by your browser on your computer's hard drive. Our cookies allow us to personalize your experience on our site, make your visit more convenient, and understand how you and others are using our site so that we can improve your experience on the site. We use cookies to identify repeat visitors to our site and to determine whether you visited our site from a particular Internet link or advertisement.

**How We Use Information**  


We collect, retain, and use customer information for legitimate business purposes only. For example, we use the information you provide about yourself to process your application and complete a lease agreement. We do not share this information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to complete the lease process (for example, we will share your application information with our credit-verification provider). We also use job application information to process your job application, and we use E-mail addresses to answer the E-mail we receive, and to provide information about us. Such addresses are used only for our business purposes and are not shared with outside parties. We also may use the information we collected to occasionally notify you regarding important functionality changes to the Web site or to send you announcements and promotions related to our business. If you would rather not receive such correspondence please E-mail us to that effect at [customers@archstonesmith.com](mailto:customers@archstonesmith.com) or call 1-800-272-4786.

We do not use or share the personally identifiable information provided to us online in ways unrelated to our business purposes without also providing you an opportunity to opt-out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses.

**When We May Disclose Information**  
We share non-identifying, aggregate statistical information regarding visitors to our site with our partners, affiliates, and advertisers. For example, we may tell an advertiser that X number of individuals visited a certain area of our Web site, or that Y number of men and Z number of women filled out an application form, but we would not disclose anything that could be used to identify those individuals. This practice serves to improve the design of our Web site and provide marketing information to our advertisers.

In addition, we will disclose information we maintain when required to do so by law, or may disclose such information in response to a request from a law enforcement agency or authority.

**Our Commitment To Data Security**  
To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data security, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online. "Hard copies" of all application and lease contract documents are maintained in our property offices.

We provide various security safeguards to protect your information. We use state-of-the-art technology to protect your data from disclosure to unauthorized third parties. Currently we use firewall and intrusion prevention technologies to protect your data and secure your transactions. Secure Socket Layer encrypts/encodes all of your personal information (including your name, address, social security number, salary information, etc.) as it is transmitted over the Internet.

We otherise limit the disclosure of your information. We do not sell, trade, or rent your personally identifiable information to others. When we do provide information to others, as noted above, it is either to provide you with services or we share such information only in aggregate, statistical form. 

Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important. For that reason, we do not collect or maintain information at our Web site from those we know are under 13, and we do not permit children under 13 years of age to become registered users of our Web site. No part of our Web site is structured to attract anyone under 13. By using our site you represent that you are not under 13 years of age.

**Links  To Third Party Web Sites**  
Our site may offer links to other Web sites which may have information policies and practices different from ours. We do not control and are not responsible for the privacy policies or practices or the content of any third party Web sites.

You can correct factual errors in your personally identifiable information by sending us a request that credibly shows error. To protect your privacy and security, we will also take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access or making corrections.
