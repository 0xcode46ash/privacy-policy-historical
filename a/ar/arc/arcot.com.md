# Arcot Privacy

**Privacy**

To protect your privacy, we have adopted the following principles:

**Choice**  
If you choose to give us personal information via our Website, it is our intent to let you know how we will use such information. Moreover, Arcot will offer you the opportunity to choose (opt out) if your personal information will be used for a purpose that is incompatible with the purpose(s) for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized by you.

**Security**  
Arcot is dedicated to protecting your personal information from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction.

**Data Integrity**  
Arcot will only use your personal information for the purpose for which it has been collected or authorized by you.

**Access**  
Arcot recognizes your right to correct, amend or delete any inaccurate personal information you submit to Arcot, except where the rights of a person other than yourself would be violated. Thus, we have implemented appropriate technical and managerial procedures to maintain information that is accurate, current, and complete. We will make a sincere effort to respond to your requests to correct personal information inaccuracies in a timely manner.

**Website Information Logging**  
Arcot uses standard commercial Web logging tools to gather information about your IP address. For example, Arcot uses your IP address to help diagnose the performance of our server and to administer our Website. Arcot may use your IP address to gather general demographic information, such as determining how many of our visitors are from a particular region. In addition, Arcot may perform an analysis of your IP address to determine which domain you are coming from (i.e., yahoo.com, hotmail.com), establish more accurate demographic information, and analyze this data for trends and statistics.

**External Links**  
The Arcot Systems, Inc. site may contain links to other Websites. Arcot Systems, Inc. is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Websites.

**Our Commitment**  
We are committed to privacy, and therefore have implemented these practices for the Arcot Website (www.arcot.com). Arcot reserves the right to modify its privacy policy and will post any changes on this page. If you have any questions or comments, please contact [webmaster@arcot.com](mailto:webmaster@arcot.com).

Thank you.

**We at Arcot Systems, Inc. ("Arcot") respect your privacy and are committed to protecting the personal information that you share with us. To meet that goal, Arcot intends to give you as much control as possible over your personal information.**

**In general, you can visit the Arcot Website without telling us who you are or revealing any information about yourself. There are times, however, when we may need information from you, such as your name, address and e-mail address, when you are requesting information about a product or services from us via one of our online forms.**
