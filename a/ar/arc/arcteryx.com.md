## Arc'teryx Privacy Policy

Arc'teryx Equipment Inc. is a worldwide leader in the performance soft goods industry.

This Privacy Policy applies to Arc'teryx Equipment Inc. and its affiliates ("Arc'teryx", "we", "us", "our") and explains how we collect, use and disclose personal information. This policy describes the type of information we collect and use, how we will protect it, when we may disclose it, and how you can update your information.

This Privacy Policy does not apply to personal information about employees, partners or other staff, consultants, volunteers or other individuals assigned to Arc'teryx (collectively, "Arc'teryx Members"), or to any information which is not personal information as defined in or interpreted under applicable Canadian law.

### Privacy in General

At Arc'teryx, we respect your privacy. Arc'teryx will never sell, trade, rent or loan your personal information to any other organization. "Personal information" is information about an identifiable individual as described in applicable privacy legislation.

At Arc'teryx, we take steps to ensure we meet the privacy principles and requirements for personal information under Canadian law. The purpose of this Privacy Policy is to inform our customers, visitors and other individuals we deal with ("you" or "your") about how we collect, use, and disclose personal information in our custody or control.

### Consent

We collect, use and disclose your personal information with your consent or as permitted or required by law. Your consent may be expressed or implied, depending on the circumstances and the sensitivity of the personal information in question. In most cases, your consent to the collection, use and disclosure of personal information by Arc'teryx may be implied by the fact that you have contacted us or purchased our goods or services and voluntarily provided your personal information to us. If you provide personal information about another person to us, we assume you have the consent of that individual to enable us to collect, use or disclose their information and described in this policy.

If you choose to provide your personal information to Arc'teryx we assume that you consent to the collection, use and disclosure of your personal information as outlined in this policy.

You may refuse consent to our collection, use and disclosure of your personal information subject to legal and contractual requirements as well as reasonable notice. If you do not consent, please do not provide us with your personal information. Where applicable, please exercise the opt-in or opt-out options offered to you on our website or in our dealings with you. You may also withdraw your consent to our further collection, use and disclosure of your personal information by contacting our Privacy Officer at [privacy@arcteryx.com](mailto:privacy@arcteryx.com?subject=Privacy%20Policy%20Enquiry) or at 604.960.3001. Please note that if you withdraw your consent to our use of your personal information, we may no longer be able to provide you with certain of our services.

There are instances where Arc'teryx may collect, use or disclose your personal information without your consent. For example, we may use or disclose your personal information to comply with a subpoena or court order, under applicable law, or to collect a debt you owe to us.

### What Personal Information is Collected and How it is Used

We collect personal information directly from you or through our interactions with you or about you. Arc'teryx may ask you to provide your personal information (including your address, date of birth, telephone number, e-mail address or work affiliation), your credit card or other financial information, or information about your opinions or preferences with respect to participation in events, programs or services offered by Arc'teryx from time to time, We also collect personal information like your product preferences, store preferences, and other information when you complete our surveys, enter our contests, or otherwise complete Arc'teryx forms.

Authorized Arc'teryx Members, our agents and service providers may have access to your personal information. We use or disclose your personal information to, as applicable, provide you with products or services, register purchased products and otherwise manage our relationship with you, improve our website and marketing practices, and to administer our events, programs or other services. We may use your personal information to offer products or services to you, communicate with you regarding the products, services or information at your request, administer our customer databases, process and collect our accounts, send you surveys, catalogues, e-mails, or other notifications of Arc'teryx products, events and offers, invite you to Arc'teryx events, and as otherwise permitted or required by law or for purposes for which you otherwise provide your consent. If you do not wish to receive information from us about our products, services or events, you may ask us not to contact you for these purposes.

We may disclose the personal information we collect from you in certain circumstances, including: 

  * where you have expressly or implicitly asked us to disclose your personal information to a third-party for a designated purpose (for example, to obtain credit or to attend an Arc'teryx sponsored event);
  * where we reasonably believe a third-party requesting your personal information is your agent;
  * if we are required or authorized by law to do so (for example, if a court issues a subpoena or order);

Arc'teryx has implemented physical, organizational, and technological security measures to safeguard the personal information in our custody or control. These include protection against loss, theft or fraud as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use or modification of personal information.

If you provide us with credit card information, that information is transmitted via Secure Socket Layer ("SSL") technology and then encrypted into our databases to be used and accessed only as described in this Privacy Policy.

Arc'teryx may transfer your personal information to service providers who administer or provide products, services or information on our behalf. We use reasonable measures to require the organizations with whom we share your personal information use your personal information only to perform the services we have hired them to provide.

Some of the service providers that process or handle personal information on our behalf are located outside of Canada.
