**What Personally Identifiable Information Of Customer Or User Â  of yours is collected**

Information collected online is often defined as being either anonymous or personally identifiable: 

  1. "Anonymous Information" refers to information that cannot be tied back to a specific individual. For instance, we may know that 10,000 people visit this Privacy Policy today, but we do not necessarily know their names, where they live, or their date of birth.
  2. "Personally Identifiable Information Of Customer Or User" or "PIIOCOU" refers to information that tells us specifically who you are, such as your name, phone number, or postal address.



The amount of Personally Identifiable Information Of Customer Or User that you choose to disclose to us is completely up to you. In our effort to provide personalization and opportunities for prizes and services, we may at times ask you to submit information such as your name or email address, or to share your interests and hobbies with us. The type of information may include: 

  * Credit card information to process your request for products, programs, or services. 
  * Information you provide when registering to receive goods or services from one or more of our partners. 
  * Information you provide when entering into a contest, sweepstakes or promotion sponsored by ArcGames and/or one of our partners. 
  * Information you provide when filling out a user survey. 
  * Information you provide if you contact customer service. 
  * Data related to the areas of ArcGames that you visit and how often you visit those areas. This includes co-branded sections of ArcGames that are part of our overall service.



You never have to answer any questions, and you can decline this exchange of information at any time. However, if you should choose to withhold requested information, we may not be able to provide you with some of the services dependent upon the collection of this information, such as a personalized start page a personalized stock portfolio, a sweepstakes entry, or the purchase and shipment of products and prizes to people who visit our network. 

When you surf the Internet, your Internet browser (such as Netscape Navigator(r) or Microsoft Internet Explorer) automatically transmits some information to ArcGames every time you access content on one of our sites. Examples of such information include the URL of the Web page you were just on (known as the "Refer"), the IP (or Internet Protocol) address of the computer you are using, or the browser version you are using to access our site. All of this information may be collected by ArcGames and used to help improve our offerings to you. 

We use third-party advertising cookies to serve some of the ads that appear when you visit our Web site. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, e-mail address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other Web sites to provide advertisements about goods or services that may be of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, we encourage you to contact those companies directly or the Network Advertising Initiative at www.networkadvertising.org for further information on the policies of major third party ad servers and how to opt-out.. 

_Children Under the Age of 13_

As a matter of policy, ArcGames does not knowingly collect PIIOCOU from anyone under the age of 13 or allow such persons to register. If you are a person under age 13 who registered on the ArcGames Website prior to the date of transfer, no data pertaining to you (including any PIIOCOU) has been provided to us. 

**How the information is used**

We use the personal information you supply us, including your registration of any of ArcGames products and/or services data, to enhance our services, fulfill your requests for products, programs, or services, personalize your experience and provide you or permit others to provide you with special offers we think you will find valuable. We also use other information obtained from user site traffic patterns to better provide you with a personalized experience and special advertising offers and promotions. We view personalized advertising as beneficial to our users. 

We also use your registration of any of ArcGames products and/or services data information in connection with the sweepstakes and other promotions in order to track your progress, to notify you if you are a winner and to ensure that we comply with the applicable laws. 

ArcGames uses the information described above to do, among other things, the following: 

  * Personalize and enhance the ArcGames site and service such as providing you with your personalized information, and advertisements we believe will be of interest to you. 
  * Send PIIOCOU about ArcGames and its site features, prizes and special offers, unless you have opted out of receiving these types of communications.

  * Provide your PIIOCOU to selected 3rd parties unless you have opted not to permit such sharing. 
  * Provide you with advertising and other promotional offers that we believe will be of interest to you. 
  * Contact users for feedback regarding ArcGames and ArcGames's partners via email surveys.



We may also use the information we collect to develop summary reports for our advertisers. An example of a summary report might be "200,000 people clicked on this link and of those people, 35% were registered users above the age of 25." We provide this information to assist our advertisers in determining how to promote their products. We do not tell our advertisers who it was that saw or clicked on their advertisements unless you have told us this is acceptable. 

Unless you have opted out of receiving special offers, emails or other communications from selected third parties, we also may provide a report to our advertiser which tells them who responded to a particular offer. For example, we might send you an email, launch a new window within your internet browser, or send you other advertisements in electronic form which offer you a discount on a particular good or service. If you click on that e-mail or advertisement or accept an offer or discount contained therein, we may provide the advertiser with the information necessary to provide you with that discount or offer. 

ArcGames may be required by law enforcement or judicial authorities to provide Personally Identifiable Information Of Customer Or User to appropriate governmental authorities. If requested by law enforcement or judicial authorities, we will provide this information upon receipt of the appropriate documentation. ArcGames may also provide information to law enforcement to protect its property and the health and safety of individual as permitted by statute. 

Other companies that place advertising on our site may collect information about you when you view or click on their advertising or content through the use of cookies (using the same techniques as described above). Due to the way the Internet technically operates, we cannot control this collection of information. As the consumer you should contact these advertisers or content providers that place information on the ArcGames Website directly if you have any questions about their use of the information they potentially collect.

Information that you provide while using products such as ArcGames Message and/or forums Boards and ArcGames Chat (when instituted) is available for all to see. Discretion should be used in entering Personally Identifiable Information Of Customer Or User within such forums, as it may be collected by third parties. ArcGames does not actively associate the message content entered by our users in ArcGames Message and/or Forums Boards, or ArcGames Chat (when instituted) products with those users' registration of any of ArcGames products and/or services information. Our server computers will retain this information, however; and it is potentially available for distribution to third parties - most obviously law-enforcement agencies acting under subpoena power, per the terms of this section of our Privacy Policy. We do not use this information to target any advertising to our users, nor is it ever willingly distributed to any third party, such as an advertiser, except if subpoenaed.

**With whom the information may be shared**

In general, ArcGames does not disclose your Personally Identifiable Information Of Customer Or User to any third party without first providing you with an opportunity to opt out, except in special situations described below, such as to comply with the law or administer the site. Unless you have opted out, ArcGames may make your Personally Identifiable Information Of Customer Or User available to selected companies. You can elect to opt-out at anytime by emailing us at [administration@arcgames.com](mailto:administration@arcgames.com) with OPTOUT as the subject. You can also elect not to use certain services or participate in certain promotions if you do not want your information shared with the third parties who are sponsoring or administering such promotions. In the event that all or substantially all of ArcGames's stock and/or assets are transferred or sold to another entity, ArcGames may transfer Personally Identifiable Information Of Customer Or User to the acquiring entity. If, as a result of such a business transition, your Personally Identifiable Information Of Customer Or User will be used in a materially different manner, you will be given choice consistent with our policy regarding notification of changes. 

ArcGames may disclose your Personally Identifiable Information Of Customer Or User if we believe in good faith that we are required to do so in order to comply with applicable law, a subpoena, or other legal process. ArcGames may also disclose Personally Identifiable Information Of Customer Or User when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be violating our Terms of Service or to protect the safety of our users and the public or under confidentiality agreements with certain third parties which assist us in developing, operating and maintaining ArcGames.

**What happens when you leave ArcGames to go to other sites**

ArcGames does not control the information collection and distribution policies on Internet domains other than those internet domains that are under the control of ArcGames itself. When you are on the ArcGames Website, you may be directed to other sites that are beyond our control. For example, if you "click" on a banner advertisement or an ArcGames Website search result, or a text link, or a picture link, the "click" may take you off the ArcGames Website site. These other sites may independently collect data, solicit personal information, or send their own cookies to you. ArcGames is not responsible for any use of the information including click-stream data, that you may create when using such third party sites. 

We also offer you access to "co-branded" services that are jointly provided by ArcGames and selected companies. In many cases, these co-branded services will contain ArcGames Website branding, but may not be hosted by ArcGames. You may notice that you are on a co-branded site if the pages say "provided by", "hosted by", "ArcGames Hosting, ArcGames Web Hosting", if standard ArcGames branding is not displayed on the top of the page or at the bottom of the page, or if you are asked to subscribe for any service or provide additional information. In such cases, if you use the co-branded service, ArcGames may be entitled to receive information about what you do when using that service. If you elect to provide additional personal information using a co-branded service, the information you provide may be shared or jointly retained by the provider of that service in accordance with that provider's privacy policies and terms of service. We encourage you to read the privacy polices of these other companies and to contact these companies directly if you have any questions about their use of this information. When you are using a co-branded service, we will attempt to make sure that there is a link to the service provider's applicable privacy policies and terms of service. 

We may also offer you access to software products which are installed on an individual user's computer. ArcGames software applications automatically communicate over the Internet with our servers and, in order to provide you with ArcGames Website services, may convey to ArcGames certain information regarding your activities at destinations other than the ArcGames Website, such as the URL of sites you visit. ArcGames software applications may also upgrade their functionalities from time to time, and some of these functionalities may expand the scope of the information that is communicated to ArcGames Website's servers.

**What choices are available to you regarding collection, use, and distribution of personal information**

You can always choose whether or not to disclose Personally Identifiable Information Of Customer Or User and that choice will not prevent you from using the ArcGames Website. Please note, however if you should choose to withhold requested information, we may not be able to provide you with some of the services dependent upon the collection of this information, such as a personalized information or newsletter, a sweepstakes entry, or the purchase and shipment of products and prizes. 

You can choose at anytime to opt out of receiving emails from ArcGames or from having your Personally Identifiable Information Of Customer Or User shared with selected companies. If you want to opt out, you can do so by emailing us at [ administration@arcgames.com](mailto:administration@arcgames.com) with OPTOUT as the subject. If you elect to "opt out" we will not, as applicable, share your personal information with third parties or send you emails. However, we may continue to use your personal information for internal purposes, to conduct sweepstakes and promotions, to enhance your user experience or as necessary to administer the site or comply with applicable law. 

We reserve the right to send a one-time registration of any of ArcGames products and/or services confirmation email, and infrequent Service Alert messages to users to inform them of specific changes that may impact their ability to use a service they have previously signed up for, regardless of email contact opt-in status. An example of a Service Alert message would be notification of the impending closing of an account that is believed to be abandoned. And finally, we also reserve the right to contact you if compelled to do so as part of a legal proceeding or if there has been a violation of our Terms of Service. ArcGames is retaining these rights because in limited cases we feel that we may need the right to contact you as a matter of law or regarding matters which will be important to you. These rights do not allow us to contact you to market a new or existing service if you have asked us not to do so, and issuance of these types of communications are rare.

_Children Ages 13-17_

We will not share the PIIOCOU of users who are 13 to 17 years old with any third party - even if that user gave us permission to do so during registration of any of ArcGames products and/or services - except in cases where the information is being shared with a nonprofit organization that offers bona fide outreach and support services to children. In cases where minors have volunteered information in the context of a peer counseling or mentoring environment on the ArcGames Website, this information will be shared with that nonprofit organization. As reflected in this Privacy Policy, we will provide PIIOCOU about our users age 13-17 to law enforcement or judicial authorities upon request and receipt of proper documentation. Additionally, if we believe that ArcGames property or an individual's safety or security is at risk, we will provide this information to proper court or law enforcement agencies. 

Although ArcGames will not share the PIIOCOU of users who are 13-17 years old with any third party, the ArcGames Website includes co-branded web properties, sponsor pages and links to other sites where you may be offered an opportunity to provide PIIOCOU directly to a third party. If you elect to provide such information, we recommend that you review the privacy practices of that party. For more information on co-branded sites, see the section entitled "What happens when you leave ArcGames to go to other sites", above.

**What kind of security procedures are in place to protect against the loss, misuse, or alteration of information under the company's control**

ArcGames operates secure data networks protected by industry standard firewall and password protection systems, along with special security measures designed by ArcGames. Our security and privacy policies are periodically reviewed and enhanced as necessary, and only authorized individuals have access to the information provided by our users. Even your registration of any of ArcGames products and/or services account password is encrypted before it is sent to our computers. Any other particularly sensitive information, such as a customer's credit card number collected for a commerce transaction, is also encrypted prior to transmission. 

ArcGames takes steps to ensure that your information is treated securely and in accordance with our Terms of Service and this Privacy Policy. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you transmit to us or from our online products or services, and you use these services at your own risk. We recommend that you do not divulge your password to anyone. ArcGames will never ask you for your password in an unsolicited phone call or in an unsolicited email. You the consumer are ultimately responsible for the security of your ArcGames registration Name and password.
