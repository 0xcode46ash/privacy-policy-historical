# Arcademic Skill Builders: Privacy Policy

Arcademic Skill Builders is a service for teachers, parents, and students to practice educational subjects. The games must be played in accordance with the [Teacher Manual](https://web.archive.org/manual/). Arcademics is not responsible for student performance. It is best for teachers to play the games on the computer before directing students. Experience in playing the game will provide an understanding of the skill levels of the game.

### Information we collect and how we use it

  * All information collected for use on the Arcademics site is kept confidential. No information is sold, traded, or distributed to other agencies or organizations.
  

  * Do not provide information that discloses your personal address or other pertinent information that may be used to harm you. First initial and last name will be accepted as well as modified names approved by the teacher.
  

  * If Arcademics learns or suspects any of your user information is inappropriate, Arcademics reserves the right to suspend access to or terminate the account, immediately and without notice, and to refuse any future use of the site.
  



  * Many of the students play video games all the time at home. This was a way to let them enjoy their playing time, but to practice a skill at the same time.

  * Aligning the joy of gaming with practicing math facts clearly helps transform the experience and invites students to learn in an environment they are not only comfortable with but would seek out given the choice.

  * The math activities on your site have improved the students performance grades in classroom timed tests and have boosted the students confidence in their math abilities.
