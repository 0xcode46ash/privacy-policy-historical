## Information Collected

In general, you can visit this Web site without telling us who you are or revealing any information about yourself. Our web servers collect the domain names, not the e-mail addresses, of visitors. Our web servers also seek (as many Web sites do) to place a "cookie" (a small data file) on your computer's hard drive which allows the server to determine the computer when it visits again, in order to track statistical information about navigation to and throughout certain areas of our site, and to ARAMARK services on other sites. This cookie is not used to obtain your name or any personal data, and the information that is tracked is used only for internal purposes, such as to improve site navigation and to measure the effectiveness of our promotional placements, and is not shared with anyone other than ARAMARK affiliates and contractors who assist ARAMARK in these efforts and are bound to confidentiality. However, if you prefer not to accept cookies, you can set your browser to reject them or to alert you before one is placed.

In addition, there are portions of this Web site where we may need to collect personal information from you for a specific purpose, such as to provide you with certain information you request. The information collected from you may include your name, address, telephone, fax number, or e-mail address. For our supplier diversity area, we necessarily collect information about gender and ethnicity, such as whether your business is female-owned.

Information obtained from our Careers Section will be used solely for the purpose of accepting and evaluating your submission for possible employment and the related purposes described on our jobs site.Â In the event you provide us with any information requested in the Careers section of this Web Site, your submission will be goverened by our Candidate Data Protection Standard, a copy of which is available by clicking [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20061026030847id_/http%3A//www.aramark.com/ContentTemplate.aspx?PostingID=829&ChannelID=393). 

We do not partner with or have special relationships with any ad server companies. From time to time, we may use customer information for new, unanticipated uses not previously disclosed in our privacy notice. If our information practices change at some time in the future we will post the policy changes to our Web site to notify you of these changes and provide you with the ability to opt out of these new uses. If you are concerned about how your information is used, you should check back at our Web site periodically.

This Web site is not intended for persons under 13 years of age. We do not knowingly solicit or collect personal information from or about children, and we do not knowingly market our products or services to children.

## Use of Collected Information

Domain name information that we collect is not used to personally identify you and instead is aggregated to measure the number of visits, average time spent on the site, pages viewed, etc. We use this information to measure the use of our site and to improve the content of our site.

When other information is collected from you, such as your name and e-mail address, we generally let you know at the time of collection how we will use the personal information, such as the Careers section of our Web Site. Usually, we use the personal information you provide only to respond to your inquiry or to process your request (such as to receive electronic annual reports, to be added to our supplier diversity database or to process your request for employment). This information may be shared with other ARAMARK businesses, but only if necessary to fulfill your request or for related purposes.

We may share the personal information you provide with other companies we have hired to provide services for us. These companies - our vendors - are contractually bound to use personal information we share with them only to perform the services we have hired them to provide. We do not share, sell, or lease personal information about you to any third-parties for their marketing use. We will release information about you if you direct us to do so, if we are required by law to do so, or in other legally limited circumstances.

If you register with one of ARAMARK's business units online, they may use this information to provide you with custom information about ARAMARK offerings in support of your business needs. They may also seek to place a "cookie" (small data file) as discussed above in order to provide you with tailored information. You should review the privacy policy associated with that ARAMARK business' Web site for further information on privacy practices.

## Links to Other Sites

ARAMARK's Web site may contain links to other sites. While we try to link only to sites that share our high standards and respect for privacy, we are not responsible for the content, security, or privacy practices employed by other sites.

## Security of Collected Information

We maintain strict physical, electronic, and administrative safeguards to protect your personal information from unauthorized or inappropriate access. We restrict access to information about you to those ARAMARK workers who need to know the information to respond to your inquiry or request. Workers who misuse personal information are subject to disciplinary action.

## Access to Collected Information

You may review and update the information that you provide to us through this Web site by contacting us as described below.
