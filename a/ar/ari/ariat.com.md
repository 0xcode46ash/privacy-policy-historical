Privacy Policy  
At Ariat, your privacy is important to us. 

  * This site collects no personally identifying information about you except when you specifically and knowingly provide it. We collect email addresses and information volunteered by site visitors such as product registration, contest entries and survey information.
  * When you register, you have the discretion whether or not to submit certain information such as telephone number, address, gender and purchase criteria. This type of information helps us to understand our visitors and tailor products and promotions around your needs. Address and telephone information assist us in contacting winning entrants for any of our contest promotions. In order for Ariat International, Inc. to be able to comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, visitors are required to enter their age.
  * Visitors who supply Ariat with email or postal addresses may receive periodic mailings from Ariat with information on new products and services or upcoming events. Also, visitors may receive mailings from Ariat's retail partners regarding new products or promotions.
  * Visitors can also select whether or not they would like to be on Ariat's mailing list and email list. Visitors who choose to be on these lists and later decide they would not like to receive information may unsubscribe by replying to any email and typing UNSUBSCRIBE. Visitors who do not wish to receive mailings from companies other than Ariat may select the Do Not Share box at the bottom of the Sign In and Product Registration forms. Visitors may also contact Ariat via the Contact Us section and request removal from any lists.
  * In accordance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, Ariat International, Inc. will not collect personal information on children under the age of 13 without prior parental consent. When a child under the age of 13 attempts to register product or sign in for contests and surveys, the information will not be accepted. The site will give these visitors the option to download and print a parental consent form that, once signed by a parent or guardian, may be mailed or faxed to Ariat International, Inc. Once Ariat has received a signed parental consent form, the child's information will be entered into the site. Ariat will not provide any personal information on children under the age of 13 to third parties.
