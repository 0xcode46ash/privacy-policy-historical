# Privacy policy | Aricent

Your privacy is very important to us. This notice explains our online information collection practices and the choices available to you about the way your information is used at our website.

### **Information We Collect and Use**

We do not collect personal information about you (your name, telephone, address, e-mail, etc.) other than the information which you voluntarily provide to us through this site in order to satisfy your requests such as to subscribe to a newsletter. If you have emailed us with any enquiry (for example, about a company event or in relation to a job application), we will use your email address to respond to your query.

We may also send you further information about our services or keep you informed of legal updates through our periodic newsletters, provided you have indicated that you are happy to be contacted for these purposes. You can tell us not to contact you with updates and information regarding our products and services either at the point such information is collected (by checking or un-checking (as directed) the relevant box) or, where you do not wish us to continue to use your information in this way, by following the unsubscribe instructions on any communications sent to you. You can also exercise this right at any time by contacting us using the contact details at the end of this privacy policy.

We do automatically collect certain non-personal information when you visit our website, such as the type of browser and operating system you are using, and the domain name of your internet service provider (such as Comcast, AT&T). We use such non-personal information to analyze site usage (aggregated information about which pages were visited by our users) in order to improve the design and content of our website.

### **With whom information is shared**

Any personal information gathered by us may be shared, as appropriate, with any Aricent offices, affiliates, agents or contractors who assist us in providing the services we offer, such as, for example, fulfilling requests for information, receiving and sending communications, updating marketing lists, analyzing data, providing support services or in other tasks from time to time. Our agents and contractors will only use your information to the extent necessary to perform their functions.

We may disclose your personal information if required to do so by law, court order, or at the request of a law enforcement agency or if we believe that such action is necessary to protect and defend the rights, property of personal safety of Aricent, its website or its visitors. In the event that we undergo re-organisation or are sold to a third party, you agree that any personal information we hold about you may be transferred to that re-organised entity or third party.

### **International Transfers**

Personal information which you submit via the site may be transferred to other countries outside of the European Economic Area (“EEA”). If we transfer your personal information outside the EEA in this way, we will take steps to ensure that your privacy rights continue to be protected.

### **Collection of Information by Third Party Sites**

Like many other commercial websites, our site contains links to other sites whose information collection practices may be different than ours. Users should consult the other sites' privacy notices, as we do not have any control over any information that may be submitted to or collected by such third parties.

Although we employ security measures to prevent unauthorized access to information we collect online, we cannot guarantee the security of your personal information. Specifically, we cannot guarantee the privacy of personal information you transmit over the web, or that may be collected in transit by third parties, including any consultants that provide services to us
