# ARIN Privacy Statement

  | 

* * *

|    | 

The American Registry for Internet Numbers places a high value on the privacy of our members and other visitors to our site. Because we value your privacy so highly we have developed this Privacy Statement to inform you about our privacy practices for the entire ARIN website.

**What Information Do We Collect?**

> **Personal Information**.
> 
> ARIN does not collect any personal information from you unless you personally, explicitly, and intentionally provide it to us.
> 
> As is standard practice for most websites, certain visitor characteristics are reflected in our web server logs (e.g. operating system, browser version, and Internet Protocol (IP) address). We make no attempt to link them with the individual visitors to the site.
> 
> On its website, ARIN requires some visitors to provide certain personally identifiable information for purposes such as becoming a member, renewing membership, handling template requests, participating in discussion groups, submitting inquiries and comments, or registering for conferences. This information may include name, postal address, e-mail address, and other pertinent data.
> 
> Questions about this privacy statement should be directed to [webmaster@arin.net](mailto:webmaster@arin.net?Subject=Privacy%20Statement%3E). Please specify "Privacy Statement" in the subject line of your e-mail. You will receive a response within three business days of your inquiry.

**What We Do With That Information**

> With regard to non-personally identifiable information, we may periodically analyze our website logs to assess aggregate usage trends in order to better serve the needs of visitors to the site. Under some circumstances this information may be used for purposes of systems administration or server troubleshooting and security. The website logs are archived in their entirety and kept purely as an internal reference.
> 
> We do not sell, rent, or share any personally identifiable information voluntarily supplied by visitors or our membership mailing list.
> 
> Membership information is collected and maintained solely in order to provide our members with access to specific benefits accorded to them through membership in ARIN. Any further e-mail addresses, phone numbers, or other contact information submitted by visitors voluntarily in the course of inquiries and comments are used only for purposes of taking action in relation to the nature of the inquiry or comment.
> 
> In addition, ARIN's WHOIS program provides information on IP addresses, Autonomous System numbers (ASNs), and related objects including name servers and Points of Contact (POC). The Point of Contact information is stripped when ARIN provides organizations a bulk copy of the WHOIS output, and ARIN requires the requester of Bulk WHOIS data to affirm that they will only use the data for Internet operational or technical research purposes.

**Use of Cookies**

> "Cookies" are pieces of information that a browser can record after visiting a website. We currently do not use cookies on our site, but may do so in the future.

**Membership Database**

> ARIN members may receive periodic e-mail or postal mailings from us with information about ARIN, upcoming events, or issues related to ARIN and RIR policy. In addition, our website lists our member organization's names and a link to their websites (if the URL is provided by the member).

**Security**

> While no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100 percent secure, we take measures designed to protect the security of data transmitted to us upon receipt. Our databases, including the member database and system administration logs, are restricted only to authorized users. Online transactions of a sensitive nature, e.g. credit card numbers, are protected by secure browser connections.
> 
> Our site supports use of secure socket layer (SSL) encryption technology to encrypt your personally identifiable information prior to transmission over the Internet. Users whose browsers do not support SSL encryption are encouraged to contact us by phone or in writing.

**Links**

> This website contains links to other sites. Please be aware that ARIN cannot be responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of those sites that collect personally identifiable information. This privacy statement pertains only to this website.

**Discussion Groups**

> Please note that this privacy statement does not apply to any posting by you in any of the ARIN discussion groups, discussion threads, or interactive areas of this website. Your participation in those discussion areas and anything you post in those areas may be attributed to you and displayed, republished, and otherwise disseminated by ARIN, in accordance with the Acceptable Use Policy you agree to abide by in order to participate in those areas.

**Compliance and Questions**

> If you have any questions regarding our privacy policy or you feel that this site is not following its stated information policy, please contact the ARIN Member Services Department by e-mail to [webmaster@arin.net](mailto:webmaster@arin.net?Subject=Privacy%20Statement%3E).

> Subject to the above provisions, by using our site, you consent to the collection and use of information by us in accordance with this privacy statement. If we decide to make a material change to our privacy statement or the way we use your personally identifiable information then at least thirty (30) days prior to making any material change to the Privacy Statement or in the way we use your personally identifiable information we will post such changes in this Privacy Statement, we will post notice of the nature of such change on the ARIN home page at [http://www.arin.net](https://web.archive.org/web/20031203052125id_/http%3A//www.arin.net/index.html) and on the [arin-announce mailing list](https://web.archive.org/web/20031203052125id_/http%3A//www.arin.net/mailing_lists/index.html).
