# Privacy Policy | Arkadin US

Arkadin collects and uses the Personal Information you provide in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy. If you provide Personal Information for a certain reason, we will use the Personal Information in connection with the purpose for which it was provided. If Arkadin intends on using any Personal Information in any manner that is not consistent with this Privacy Policy, you will be informed of such anticipated use prior to or at the time at which the Personal Information is collected.

The Personal Information we request may include personally identifiable information such as your e-mail address, first name, last name, credit card number, a user-specified password, mailing address, zip code, mobile telephone number and home telephone number. It is solely your choice whether or not you provide the Personal Information. However, should you choose not to provide the Personal Information, we may be unable to process an order, fulfil a service or display certain content on the Site. When you visit the Site, we send a cookie and/or “gif” file (a "cookie") to assign an anonymous, unique identifier to your Internet browser. Cookies are files that web browsers place on a computer's hard drive and are used to tell us whether visitors have visited the Site previously.

Stand-alone cookies do not identify a visitor personally. They merely recognize that visitor’s browser. Unless a visitor chooses to identify itself to Arkadin by logging in, it remains anonymous to Arkadin. Cookies come in two types: “session” and “persistentbased”.

Session cookies exist only during an online session and disappear from the visitor’s computer when the visitor closes its browser software or turns off its computer. Persistent cookies remain on a visitor’s computer after it has closed its browser or turned off its computer. Persistent cookies include such information as a unique identifier for a browser.

Arkadin uses session cookies containing encrypted information to allow the system to uniquely identify you while you are using the Site. This information allows Arkadin to process your online transactions and requests. Session cookies help us make sure you are who you say you are after you log in and are required in order to use the Site. If you disable your web browser’s ability to accept cookies, you will be able to browse the Site but will not be able to successfully use all of the Services. We treat any information that may be contained in cookies with the same level of protection as Personal Information you provide to us.
