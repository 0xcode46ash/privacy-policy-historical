You also have the right to obtain a copy of any personal information which we hold about you and to
advise us of any perceived inaccuracy. The Data Protection Act 1998 does set out some exceptions to

We limit access of information only to those relevant employees or partners that need to know the
information in order to enable the carrying out of the Agreement between us. We do not hold or store
Credit/Debit card data.
We have procedures in place regarding how to safeguard and use Your Information, for example by
requesting our Affiliates and employees to maintain the confidentiality of Your Information.
We will not keep your personal information for any longer than is required. In many cases,
information must be kept for considerable periods of time. However, when we consider that
information is no longer needed, we will remove any details that will identify you or we will securely
destroy the records.
While we will use all reasonable efforts to safeguard our clients’ personal information , you
acknowledge that the use of the internet is not entirely secure and for this reason we cannot
guarantee the security or integrity of any personal data transferred from you, or to you via the
internet.
8. Your consent
By submitting any personal information (including, without limitation, your account details) to us you
consent to the use of information as set out in this Policy. We reserve the right to amend or modify
this Privacy Policy and if we do so we will post the changes on the Website. It is your responsibility to
check the Privacy Policy when you submit information to us. Your use of the Website will signify that
you agree to any such changes.
Owing to the global nature of the Internet infrastructure, the information you provide may be
transferred in transit to countries outside the European Economic Area. We also operate globally and
so it may be necessary to transfer your personal information to other companies within our group of
companies or to other third parties located in countries outside of the EEA to enable the provision of
the services you have requested. Countries outside of the EEA may not have similar protections in
place regarding your data and its use as set out in this Policy. However, we have taken the necessary
steps outlined above and required by applicable law to try and protect the security of your
information.
9. Personal information and other websites
We are not responsible for the privacy policies and practices of other websites even if you accessed a
third party website using links from our Website. We recommend that you check the policy of each
website you visit and contact the owner or operator of such website if you have concerns or
questions.
10.      How to contact us
If you have any questions regarding this Policy, wish to access or change your information or have a
complaint, or if you have any questions about security on our Website, you may email us at
support@tickmill.co.uk.
