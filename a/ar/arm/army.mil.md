# The United States Army Home Page

The Army’s public web site, WWW.ARMY.MIL, is The Army’s only communicative tool that maintains a connection with the American public and the global audience 24/7/365. The Army is at war and we must have a timely, accurate, and professional presence on the web. This will enhance understanding of the Army's strategic vision, missions, and roles in support of the Nation. 

WWW.ARMY.MIL supports the overall mission of the Department of the Army by providing official, timely and accurate information about Army policies, organizations, functions and operations. WWW.ARMY.MIL provides another starting point for finding military information online in conjunction with the Department of Defense web site “DefenseLINK” and the other services’ web sites. 

Information available at WWW.ARMY.MIL is consistent with Army and DoD policies and The Principles of Information and contains information cleared for public release. Information intended for the internal Army audience is available through Army Knowledge Online (AKO) at [www.us.army.mil](http://www.us.army.mil/).
