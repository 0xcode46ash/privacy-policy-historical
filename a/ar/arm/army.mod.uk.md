# Privacy and Cookies - British Army Website

## Cookies

When we provide services, we want to make them easy, useful and reliable. Where services are delivered on the internet, this sometimes involves placing small amounts of information on your device, for example, computer or mobile phone. These include small files known as cookies. They cannot be used to identify you personally. These pieces of information are used to improve services for you through, for example: 

  * enabling a service to recognise your device so you don't have to give the same information several times during one task 
  * recognising that you may already have given a username and password so you don't need to do it for every web page requested 
  * measuring how many people are using services, so they can be made easier to use and there's enough capacity to ensure they are fast 



You can manage these small files yourself and learn more about them via the 'Internet browser cookies - what they are and how to manage them' link on the right. [](http://www.army.mod.uk/)

## Our Privacy Policy

The Army, as part of the Ministry of Defence, is committed to protecting your privacy. 

When you contact us or visit our websites, your personal information is stored securely and processed fairly as required by the Data Protection Act 1998. 

This Privacy Policy explains the following 

  * What information the Army may collect about you 
  * How the Army will use your information and ensure this is not shared with organisations outside the Ministry of Defence 
  * How long your information may be held on our systems 
  * Your choices regarding the personal information you provide to us 
  * How cookies are used on our websites and the options available to reject these 



### Changes to our privacy policy 

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time, so you may want to check the latest version before providing personal data to the Army. This version was last updated on 19 October 2011. 

### How we collect information

 We collect personal information when you

  * Register online, request an information pack or submit an application through our websites 
  * Complete a printed form, questionnaire or coupon 
  * Contact us by phone, post, email or text message 



In addition, information is automatically captured each time you visit our websites. We use cookies (as described above) and collect IP addresses (that can uniquely identify a specific computer or network device on the internet) to track visitors to our websites and prepare management reports. 

### What we do with this information

We use the personal information you provide to answer your enquiries, fulfil information pack requests, process applications to join the Army, and to make improvements to our websites. 

### We do not share personal information 

The Army will not share your personal details with other organisations outside the Ministry of Defence. 

Your information may be handled by the companies we use to provide data processing and marketing services. These third-parties are required to comply strictly with our privacy policies that prohibit the use of personal data for their own business purposes. 

Individuals applying to join the Army should be aware that their personal information may be shared with other MOD organisations and Services \- including the Royal Air Force and Royal Navy. 

### How long do we keep your information

Your information will be held on our systems for as long as is necessary to answer your requests and maintain a dialogue with those individuals who remain interested in the Army and Army careers. 

If you are under the age of 25 years, we will keep your personal information for no more than 3 years. If you are 25 years or older, we will keep your personal information for no more than 2 years. 

This period starts on the day you last made contact with the Army, and is reset each time you make an enquiry, request an information pack, complete an application, register/logon to our website, or change your recruiting status as a candidate. 

At the end of this period, we will remove your personal information from our systems or treat the data to remove any personal identifiers that could be used to identify you as an individual. 

### Will I be contacted by the Army for marketing purposes? 

We will only contact or send information about the Army and Army careers to those people who have given us permission to do so. 

We will only provide information that is relevant to you. Further details are provided in our [Communications Policy](https://web.archive.org/25527.aspx). 

If you choose to receive these communications, you will be given the opportunity to select your preferences for post, phone, email or text messages. You can change these preferences whenever you provide us with your contact details or at any time by logging on to My Account (if you have registered online). Please read the privacy notices displayed on each form for further information about these options. 

### Advice for parents and young people 

Many young people are interested in information about the Army. The privacy and security of their personal data is very important to us. 

We do not process or store personal data about children under 14 years and will not accept or solicit enquiries, requests, registrations or applications from children. 

We ask individuals under 16 years to confirm that they have spoken to a parent/guardian and obtained their permission before providing us with personal data. We will not accept or process requests or store personal data about 14 and 15 year olds without this confirmation. 

We encourage all parents to supervise their children’s use of the internet and for young people to always get the permission of a parent/guardian before entering any personal information in any website.
