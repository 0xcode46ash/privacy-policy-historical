**ARMSTRONG ONLINE PRIVACY POLICY**   
Armstrong strives to achieve the highest standards of integrity for every online visitor. When you register at the Armstrong Web site, we aim to respect your privacy. Armstrong does not sell or give your information to anyone. We collect personally identifiable information for four reasons: 1) to e-mail consumers with updates and news, 2) to notify winners of contests, 3) to send out product information via regular mail, and 4) to provide access to specialized areas of the site. 

**ELECTRONIC MAILING LISTS**   
On all of our online registration forms, you can select whether or not you want to receive future e-mail from us. If at any time you wish to be taken off an Armstrong mailing list, please send a message to [unsubscribe@www.Armstrong.com](mailto:unsubscribe@www.Armstrong.com) and write, "unsubscribe Armstrong" in the body of the message. 

**PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION**   
We do not require you to disclose any personally identifiable information for general access to our site. Business partners and professional visitors requesting access to specialized content areas may be required to provide identifying information. Any personally identifiable information you submit is used only to help us satisfy your requests and to make your experience on the Armstrong Web site productive and enjoyable by helping us to understand the features that are most popular. 

Website visitors may decide to send Armstrong personally identifying information, for example, in a message asking a question about an Armstrong product or containing comments about the Armstrong Web site. Armstrong will use this information only to respond to the matter identified in the email.

> **A NOTE ABOUT COOKIES** At certain points in your visit to the Armstrong site, the Armstrong server may send a "cookie" file to your computer. Generally, your Web browser will prompt you to accept this file unless you have set your browser preferences to accept all cookies automatically. Certain data, including information entered into any form on the site, may be added to the cookie file. On your future visits to the Armstrong site, our server will scan the cookie file for relevant data and customize or personalize site content accordingly. Cookies are employed here primarily as a service to our customers, to extend the relevance and responsiveness of the Armstrong site. 

**NON-PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION**   
The Armstrong Web site may collect non-personally identifiable information, such as type of browser, operating system, domain name, or IP address. An IP address is a number that's automatically assigned to your computer whenever you're surfing the Web. Web servers—the big computers that "serve" up Web pages—automatically identify your computer by its IP address. When you visit pages on Armstrong's Web site our servers log your IP address. We do not link IP addresses to any personally identifiable information. This means that your session will be logged, but you remain anonymous to us. Non-personally identifiable information is used only to improve the service of the Armstrong site, and is then discarded. 

If you have any questions or comments about Armstrong's Privacy Policy, please contact us [here](https://web.archive.org/contact.html). 

Armstrong reserves the right to change our policy from time to time. A revised policy will apply to information collected after the date the policy is changed.
