### Privacy Policy

Effective Date: January 13, 2014

SNAP Interactive, Inc. (“SNAP”, “AYI, “we” “us”) has developed this Privacy Policy which details important information regarding the use and disclosure of user information collected on the AYI – AreYouInterested and SNAP Interactive websites (“Sites”) that link to this Privacy Policy as well as our other related mobile websites, mobile applications, services, tools, and other applications, such as AYI Now!, that link to this Privacy Policy (collectively, the “AYI Applications”). AYI provides this Privacy Policy to help you make an informed decision about whether to use or continue using the services accessed through its AYI Applications (“Services”).

#### ****Privacy Policy** Highlights**

Please also read our full Privacy Policy

#### **Full Privacy Policy  
**

This Privacy Policy is incorporated into and subject to the Terms of Service found at [http://snap-interactive.com/terms-of-service/](http://www.snap-interactive.com/terms-of-service/ "Terms of Service") (“Terms”). Each time that you access or use AYI Applications, you signify that you agree to be bound by the Terms and this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to the Terms and the terms of this Privacy Policy, you must discontinue accessing the Services available through the AYI Applications.

**I. INFORMATION WE COLLECT**

**_Registration, Product and Account Information_** **.** You can browse AYI without telling us who you are or revealing any personal information (i.e., name, email address, phone number, mobile telephone number, credit card information or physical contact information) about yourself. If you create a profile or purchase any paid services you choose to give us your personal information and are not anonymous to us. When you create a profile and register an account, or use certain of our Services such as searching for members, participating in AYI Now!, or otherwise engage with AYI Applications, you may provide certain non-public information (e.g., username and e-mail address).  You may also provide payment information (e.g., credit or debit card information, name and billing address) to purchase a premium membership. Personal information is only associated with your account/profile when you sign in as a registered user.

**_Information to respond to your requests._** **** You may give us your personal information so we can send you communications you request. Details of how you can opt-out of receiving any promotional communications from us are detailed in the section headed Accessing Your Personal Information.

**_Information Provided by You and Imported from Facebook_** **.** We will collect personal information from you when you sign up for our Services, interact with AYI Applications, update your profile, interact with other users, and use various features of our AYI Applications. By clicking allow on the Facebook permission authorization we will import your basic account information (name, email, gender, birthday, current city, and profile picture URL) into your AYI profile.  We also will import your interests, friends list, three most recent profile pictures, and “about me”.  We will display your first name, gender, current city, interests, about me, photos, and age (which is calculated from your birthdate) and you can edit all of these fields except for age and gender by logging into your account and clicking “Edit Profile”.  Once the information is in your AYI profile that information may be used across any AYI Applications.  The information we have access to from Facebook is controlled by your privacy settings on Facebook and by your consent. We only incorporate the information you allow to be imported from your Facebook profile (“Permitted Facebook Profile Content”).  By associating your Facebook account with your AYI account and authorizing us to have access to this information, you agree that we may collect, use, and store information from Facebook in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

**_Surveys and Promotions_**. From time-to-time we may request information from you and other users via surveys or contests or sweepstakes.  Participation in these surveys, contests or sweepstakes is completely voluntary. Contact information may be used to notify the winners and award prizes and file winners’ information as required by law. Survey information will be used for the purpose(s) of the survey.

**_Information You Post_** **.** AYI Applications are designed to enable you to communicate with others and any information or content you post when participating with AYI Applications and social media sites, plug ins or other applications becomes public information, depending upon your privacy settings, and is subject to redistribution by AYI  and other third parties.  There is no expectation of privacy when posting content or otherwise participating in such interactive forums and we have no control over how those users may use the information you make public.  Therefore, you should exercise caution and discretion when deciding to disclose your personal information in a submission or posting.

**_Mobile Information_**. We may collect additional information from you if you access AYI Applications through a mobile device (e.g. your unique device identifier, device’s operating system, mobile carrier, location or GPS/geo-location, and billing information which we may collect when you opt in for us to do so).

**_Information Collected Through Tracking Technologies_** **.** In addition to any personal information or other information that you choose to submit to us, we and our business partners may use a variety of tracking technologies that automatically (or passively) collect certain information from your computer, mobile, or other access device whenever you visit or interact with the AYI Applications (“Usage Information”).  We use tracking technologies (including cookies, flash cookies, web beacons/GIFs, embedded scripts, e-tags/cache browers/web logs) to collect usage information. We may use tracking technologies for a variety of purposes, including:

Operationally Necessary. We may use tracking technologies required for system administration, to prevent fraudulent activity, improve security or allow you to make use of shopping cart functionality.

Performance-Related. We may use cookies or other tracking technologies to assess the performance of our Services, including as part of our analytic practices to improve the content offered through the Services.

Functionality-Related. We may use tracking technologies to tell us, for example, whether you have visited the Sites before or if you are a new visitor and to help us identify the features in which you may have the greatest interest.

Keep in mind that certain features of our Services are only available through the use of tracking technologies. In addition, our use of tracking technologies may be associated with personally identifiable information that is associated with your user account.

You may encounter tracking technologies/cookies from our third party service providers that we have allowed on our Sites that assist us with various aspects of our web site operations and services to provide us with information about your interests from your web viewing on other sites. You may find out more information about these third parties and their practices and your choices on how such data is collected by clicking here.

You also may encounter tracking technologies from third parties on certain pages of our Sites that we do not control and have not authorized. (For example, if you view a web page created by another user, there may be a cookie placed by that web page).

We may also collect password information from you when you log in, as well as computer and/or connection information. During some visits we may use software tools to measure and collect session information, including page response times, download errors, time spent on certain pages and page interaction information.

Our goal is to collect and use only that information that we think is required for our legitimate business interests, in order to better understand your interests and improve your experience of using AYI Applications.

**_Information About Others/Inviting Friends._** From time to time you may choose to submit personal information about other people to invite them to join AYI.  Inviting friends is always optional. Please be aware that when you use any send-to-a-friend functionality on the AYI Applications, your e-mail address may be included in the communication sent to your friend.

**_Information From Other Sources_**. The information we collect may be combined with information from outside records (e.g., demographic information, navigation information, additional contact information) that we have acquired in accordance with the law.

**_Contacting Us_** **.** When you provide us with information in connection with a particular activity or otherwise sign up for our Services or provide your contact information, including an email address or telephone number in connection with that activity, product or service, you agree that this action constitutes a purchase or inquiry establishing a business relationship with us. You expressly consent to our communicating with you future information about our Services using the information you provided to us. You also attest that you have the legal authority over any telephone number you provide to us and can provide us with the authorization to contact you. This means we may contact you, in person or by recorded message, by e-mail, telephone and/or mobile telephone number (including use of automated dialing equipment), text (SMS) message, or any other means of communication that your wireless or other telecommunications device may be capable of receiving.

**II. HOW WE USE AND SHARE YOUR INFORMATION**

Permitted Facebook Profile Content will not be imported to your AYI profile without your prior consent and you can change what is in your AYI profile at any time by going to Edit My Profile.

**_Co-branded Areas.   _**Certain areas on our AYI Applications may be provided to you in association with third parties such as Match.com (“Co-Branded Areas”).  Such Co-Branded Areas will identify the third party.  If you elect to register for the products and/or services provided at these Co-Branded Areas, you either will be providing your personal information to both us and the third party or we might be providing your personal information directly to the third party in order for that third party to fulfill their products and services directly with you.  Your personal information will be subject to this Privacy Policy as well as the privacy policy and practices of such third party.  We are not responsible for the privacy practices of those third parties and we suggest you review the respective privacy policies of those third parties to learn more about their privacy practices.

**_Use of Information by Us_** **.** We may use Information that we collect about you: (1) to respond to your requests (2) provide customer service (e.g., to fulfill product orders made by you, to resolve disputes, problems with your account/profile or AYI Applications, administer a contest, sweepstakes or promotion, or to provide information to third parties at your request (3) to improve our Services and to customize your experience; (4) to give you information about your account or our Services; (5) for internal business purposes; and (6) for purposes disclosed at the time you provide your information or as otherwise set forth in this Privacy Policy.

**_Mobile Data_** **.** When you access the Sites on a mobile device, we may use the information collected for any purpose set forth in this Privacy Policy. For example, we may use this information to provide you with location-based services, such as locally based search results, and other personalized content.

**_Offers and Promotional Messages_** **.** We may also use your email address or mobile phone number to send you updates and communications about our products and services or other messages, such as newsletters, text messages, when users check-in, changes to features of the Service, or special offers.

You may also contact our privacy administrator at privacy@snap-interactive.com.

**_Legal Matters; Safety_** **.** We may, without your consent, access and disclose your information, any communications sent or received by you, and any other information that we may have about you or your account as may be permitted or required by law (including, but not limited to, court order or subpoena), or to prevent or investigate suspected fraud, violations of our Terms of Service, or activity that appears to us to be illegal or may expose us to legal liability. Additionally, we may disclose your information in situations that we believe may involve potential threats to the physical safety of any person or property if we believe that your information in any way relates to that threat.

**_Sale or Transfer of Business or Assets_** **.** If AYI is sold or disposed of as a going concern, whether by merger, sale of assets or otherwise, or in the event of an insolvency, bankruptcy or receivership, personal information of our users may be one of the assets sold or merged in connection with that transaction. Information about our users may also need to be disclosed in connection with a commercial transaction where we or any one of our businesses are seeking financing, investment, and support or funding.

**III. ACCESSING AND CHANGING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION**

Registered members can review and change personal information at any time by accessing their accounts on the Sites. If you have an account you may deactivate your AYI profile at any time.

**V. IMPORTANT DISCLOSURES, PRACTICES AND CONTACT INFORMATION**

**_Links To Other Sites_.** To the extent hyperlinks may be utilized to access external or third party sites, you should be aware that these external or third party sites are not controlled by us and, therefore, are not subject to this Privacy Policy. We recommend that you check the privacy policies of these sites to determine how your personal information will be utilized by the proprietors of those third party sites.

**_Security_** **.** We implement security measures to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of information under our control. However, despite our efforts, no system can completely guaranty that there will never be unauthorized access to your personal information, and your use of AYI Applications indicates that you are willing to assume this risk.

**_A Note to International Users_** **.** AYI Applications are hosted in the United States. If you are using AYI Applications from outside the United States, by providing your information on AYI Applications, you are consenting to the transfer of your information to the United States for processing and maintenance in accordance with this Privacy Policy and our Terms. You are also consenting to the application of United States law in all matters concerning AYI Applications.  


**_Children’s Privacy_** **.** AYI Applications are directed to a general audience and we restrict the use of our Service to individuals age 18 and above. We do not knowingly collect personal information from individuals under 18 years of age and if we obtain actual knowledge that a user is under 18 years of age, we will take steps to remove that user’s personal information from our systems.

**_No Rights of Third Parties_** **.** This Privacy Policy does not create rights enforceable by third parties or require disclosure of any personal information relating to users of the Sites.

**_Changes to the Privacy Policy_** **.** We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. You agree that we may notify you about material changes in the way we treat personal information by placing a notice on the Sites. The most recent version of the Privacy Policy will always be posted on the Sites, with the “Effective Date” posted at the top of the Policy. You should check the Sites frequently for updates. By accessing AYI Applications after the Effective Date you are deemed to consent to our then-current privacy policy.

**_Your California Privacy Rights_** **.** California Civil Code Section 1798.83, known as the “Shine The Light” law, permits our customers who are California residents to request and obtain from us a list of what personal information (if any) we disclosed to third parties for direct marketing purposes in the preceding calendar year and the names and addresses of those third parties. Requests may be made only once a year and are free of charge. To make such a request, please contact us at privacy@snap-interactive.com. For all requests, you must put the statement “Your California Privacy Rights” in the body of your request, as well as your name, street address, city, state, and zip code. In the body of your request, please provide enough information for us to determine if this applies to you. You need to attest to the fact that you are a California resident and provide a current California address for our response. Please note that we will not accept requests via the telephone, mail, or by facsimile, and we are not responsible for notices that are not labeled or sent properly, or that do not have complete information.

To provide web site visitors more choice on how their data is collected by Google Analytics, Google has developed an Opt-out Browser add-on, which is available by visiting Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on, at <https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/> to enable you to opt-out of Google’s programs.

**Cookies**. A cookie is a data file placed on a device when it is used to visit the Sites.  We use cookies to collect information for record keeping purposes, to make it easier to navigate the Sites.  Cookies are stored on users’ hard drives.  We use both “session ID cookies” and “persistent cookies.”  Session ID cookies are used to store information while a user is logged into the Sites and expire when the user closes his/her browser.  Persistent cookies are used to make tasks like logging into the Sites easier for returning users by remembering a user’s login information.  Persistent cookies stay on a user’s hard drive from one session to the next.  Flash cookies, known as local shared objects, are data files placed on a Device via the Adobe Flash plug-in that may be built-in to or downloaded by you to your Device to personalize your visit.  Our third-party service providers also may use Flash cookies to collect and store information.  Flash cookies are different from standard browser cookies because of the amount of, type of, and how data is stored. Cookies may be used for many purposes, including, without limitation, remembering you and your preferences and tracking your visits to our web pages.  You can choose to have your computer warn you each time a persistent or session cookie is being sent, or you can choose to turn off such cookies through your browser settings. Each browser is a little different, so look at your browser Help menu to learn the correct way to modify your cookies.  However, cookie management tools provided by your browser will not remove Flash cookies. To learn how to manage privacy and storage settings for Flash cookies, please click www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager.html.  If you choose to disable cookies on your Device, some features of the Sites may not function properly.

**Web Beacons/GIFS**. Small graphic images or other web programming code called web beacons (also known as “1×1 GIFs” or “clear GIFs”) may be included in our web pages and messages.  Web beacons may be invisible to you, but any electronic image or other web programming code inserted into a web page or e-mail can act as a web beacon.  Web beacons or similar technologies may be used for a number of purposes, including, without limitation, to count visitors to our Sites, to monitor how users navigate the Sites, to count how many e-mails that were sent were actually opened or to count how many particular articles or links were actually viewed.

**Embedded Scripts**. An embedded script is programming code that is designed to collect information about your interactions with the AYI Applications, such as the links you click on.  The code is temporarily downloaded onto your device used to access AYI Applications from our web server or a third party service **** provider, is active only while you are connected to the Sites, and is deactivated or deleted thereafter.  
  
**HTML5**. We use HTML5 in some of our applications, including in our mobile website for the iphone or ipad.  HTML5 has browser web storage that does not rely on traditional browser cookies.  Like Flash cookies, HTML5 cookies are not stored in a browser “cookies” file and, like Flash cookies, can be used to track users across websites.  To our knowledge there is currently no known way for a user of a mobile device to remove HTML5 tracking and storage.

**e-tags/cache browers/web logs**. Like most standard website servers, we log IP addresses (a unique number assigned to every computer on the Internet) and device identification in order to improve security, analyze trends and administer the AYI Applications.  We may track your movement within the AYI Applications, the pages from which you were referred, access times and browser types.  This information may include the browser you are using, the Internet address from which you linked to our AYI Applications, the operating system of your computer, the unique IP address of the computer or device identification from the mobile device that you used to access our AYI Applications and usage and browsing habits.  We use this information in the aggregate to gauge the effectiveness, usage, and popularity of our AYI Applications, track information for statistical purposes, help diagnose and troubleshoot server malfunctions, analyze trends, track user movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information.  We may also use individual information we collect through web logs to send you targeted offers and other communications.
