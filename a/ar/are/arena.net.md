Your privacy is important to ArenaNet and NCsoft. Maintaining the trust of our users is key to the success of our business, and this Privacy Policy is intended to make you feel as comfortable as possible visiting our website and playing ArenaNet games.

This Privacy Policy discloses the privacy practices for [www.guildwars.com](http://www.guildwars.com/) and any of our other sites and services related to _Guild Wars_. This Privacy Policy will provide you with information on our policies regarding:

  1. Collection of Personal Information
  2. Who collects the Personal Information
  3. How the Personal Information is used
  4. Privacy Protections for Children
  5. The choices available to users regarding collection, use and distribution of the Personal Information

If you feel that ArenaNet is not abiding by its posted privacy policy, you should contact us by e-mail at [privacy@arena.net](mailto:privacy@arena.net).

_Personal Information_. "Personal Information" is information that would allow someone to identify or contact you, including, for example, your full name, address, telephone number, or email address. Personal Information does not include aggregated information that, by itself, does not permit the identification of individual persons (like statistics about how many persons visited our web site last month, or how many visitors are male and how many are female).

_Acceptance_. This Privacy Policy is a part of our Terms of Service Agreement and by using the _Guild Wars_ or ArenaNet website and services, you agree to be bound by its terms and conditions. This Privacy Policy only addresses activities from our servers. Other sites (including those to which we may link) and other service providers may have their own policies, which we do not control, and thus are not addressed or controlled by this policy.

**(1) Collection of Personal Information**

> You provide certain Personal Information to us when you: (a) register to use the services, (b) register for contests or giveaways, (c) complete questionnaires, (d) order products and services from us and (e) send email messages, submit forms or send other information to us.

**(2) Who Collects the Personal Information**

> ArenaNet, who owns and operates the ArenaNet and _Guild Wars_ web sites, is the company that collects Personal Information on our site. Our mailing address is 227 Bellevue Way NE #75, Bellevue, WA 98004 and our customer service email address is [support@arena.net](mailto:support@arena.net).

**(3) How the Personal Information Is Used**

> We use your Personal Information to provide you with _Guild Wars_ content and services that are tailored specifically to the profile you provide. 
> 
> Although your privacy is very important to us, due to legal rules beyond our control, we cannot fully ensure that your private communications and other Personal Information will not be disclosed to third parties. For example, we may be forced to disclose information to the government or third parties under certain circumstances, or third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications.
> 
> Additionally, in the unlikely event we need to investigate or resolve possible problems or inquiries, we can, and you authorize us to, disclose any information about you to law enforcement or other government officials as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate. In addition, we may share Personal Information with our contractors on a need-to-know basis in order to maintain our services provided that such contractors have agreed to the non-disclosure and confidentiality requirements we require of our employees.

**(4) Privacy Protections for Children**

> In order to protect the privacy interests of younger Internet users, we do not allow children under the age of 18 to use our services without the consent of their parents.

**(5) The Choices Available to Users Regarding Collection, Use And Distribution of the Personal Information**

> Please note that if you provide any information on your own or directly to parties who provide service to our web site or any other sites you encounter on the Internet (even if these sites are branded with our branding), different rules may apply to their use or disclosure of the Personal Information you disclose to them. We encourage you to investigate and ask questions before disclosing information to third parties.

**(6) What Kind of Security Procedures We Use to Protect the Loss, Misuse, or Alteration of Your Personal Information Under Our Control**

> ArenaNet takes precautions to protect our users' information. When users submit sensitive information via our website, that information is protected both online and off-line. 
> 
> We have established and maintain reasonable security procedures to protect the confidentiality, security and integrity of your personal information. We use encryption, Secure Socket Layers, and other technical measures (such as off-site backup, security testing, and password protection), and we implement off-line efforts to further protect this information, including limiting employee access to personal information and updating our employees regarding our security practices and privacy policies. Please recognize, however, that "perfect security" does not exist on the Internet.
> 
> If you have any questions about the security at our website or facilities, you can send an email to [privacy@arena.net](mailto:privacy@arena.net).
