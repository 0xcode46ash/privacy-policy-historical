Please read the following policy that describes how and what information we collect on our website and how we use this information. Additional privacy policies apply when using information obtained from but not limited to in-person meetings, trade shows, conferences, educational sessions, and other opt-in customer agreements and disclaimers.Personal Information Usage  
When specifically requesting information, printed materials, or participating in any of our online surveys or self-assessments, you will be asked to identify yourself and submit certain information to us. When you use our submission forms, some of the information you provide is discretionary, and some maybe required (such as name, address, and contact information).

We will use this information to respond to your request or self-assessment/survey submissions. In addition, we may add your information to one or more databases that we maintain. These databases are intended to provide important demographic information to us about our current and prospective clients. Where required we may come into possession through these submissions forms of sensistive client data. As a policy ARPATECH, classifiies all customer data into two categories. Sensitive and Non-Senstive, with neither of the data sents having any basic means of cross reference. This is in order to minimize the threat of identity theaft. In other limited and controlled circumstances, we may disclose personally identifiable information in response to legal process, including response to a court order or a subpoena. We also may disclose such information in response to law enforcement agency request.

If you visit our website simply to browse, we collect and store information such as (but not limited to): the name of the domain and host from which you access the Internet (for example, hp.com); the Internet protocol (IP) address of the computer you are using; the browser software you use and your operating system; the date and time you access our site; and the Internet address of the web site from which you linked directly to our site.

This information is used to track the number of visitors to the different sections of our website. In some circumstances, we may combine this information with your personal information and use this combined information to send you emails about areas of interest of our website which you have visited.

Security (Data Classification)  
When ARPATECH receives any submitted information, we take steps to protect it from unauthorized disclosure. If you send us email, please be aware that email is not necessarily secure against disclosure or modification. As a matter of policy, ARPATECH will not use forms of instant messaging (IM) when responding to initial requests for information. If you prefer, you may use telephone or facsimile communications if you choose not to use our online forms or email. We encourage the use of encryption when discussing sensitive or proprietary matters. Please contact ARPATECH for more information concerning encrypted communications.

To further expand our data classification process, at ARPATECH all data collected from customers and consumers is stored in two physical distinct and seperate database infrastructures. Senstive data could include but limited to financial information such as credit cards, and identification information such as mother's maiden name. Cross referencing is done through a propritary cross-reference programming logic and via mathematical computation that makes reverse identity verification very difficult. ARPATECH has undertaken this process to minimize and control identity theft.

Updates  
If you would like to unsubscribe from any service that you subscribed to, change any personal information you have provided to us, or remove your information from our internal databases, please notify us by sending an email message to [webmaster@arpatech.com](mailto:webmaster@arpatech.com).
