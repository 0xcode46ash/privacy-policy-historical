# ARRSE General FAQ

### Commitment to Privacy

Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy we provide this privacy policy notice explaining our data collection practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used. 

### Personal Security

Many ARRSE users have concerns about their personal security above and beyond most internet users. To fully address security concerns, there is a detailed article about security and privacy [ here in our wiki](http://www.arrse.co.uk/wiki/ARRSESecurity).

### Information we Collect

#### Cookies

When you visit www.arrse.co.uk, we send one or more cookies to your web browser. A cookie is a small, harmless piece of information that is stored in your browser. Only the domain which set that cookie can access the information from it. (ie, other domains can't access cookies set by us and we can't access cookies set by others)

#### Server Logs

Whenever your access a file from our website, the server logs the following data: (i) Requested File name, (ii) Your IP address, (iii) Date & Time of request, (iv) Your user agent, (v) Referring webpage (if any), and (vi) Size of the requested document.

#### Forum Account

In the process of creating an account on the Army Rumour Service, we ask for your EMail address. This is done to verify your identity & that you are a real human being; and not some unscrupulous bot submitting web forms across the internet. Also, each thread, post, message you create on the Forum is associated with your Forum account & stamped with your I.P. address.

#### Visitor Patterns

We use a visitor tracking and analysis service (Google Analytics) to see how our website, website sections and webpages are performing. (e.g. Unique Visitors, Page Views, Total Visitors, etc.). No personally identifiable information is collected in this process.

#### Outbound Clicks

We track outbound clicks from our webpages too. Again, No personally identifiable information is collected in the process. Only pure statistical information like the URI of clicked link and URI of the page from which the click was done, is stored.

### Advertising Services

www.arrse.co.uk primarily uses Google Adsense to serve advertisements relevant to the webpage content. To know more about what information Google collects and uses, check out their [General Privacy Policy](http://www.google.com/privacypolicy.html) and [Advertising Policy pages](http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html).

#### Other Partners

We sometimes work in partnership with VisualDNA, part of Imagini Holdings Ltd; a provider of anonymous demographic and behavioural information to UK advertising networks. 'Tracking pixels' and cookies are used on behalf of VisualDNA to collect anonymous behavioural data. For more information about Visual DNA please visit [VisualDNA.com](http://visualdna.com/) and read their [privacy policy](http://visualdna.com/privacy-policy).

### How we Use It

#### E-Mail Addresses

EMail addresses you entered while registering on the Forum and/or while commenting on Blog posts are used to provide you updates of any content which you have subscribed to. Occasionally (once in a month or two), we send out newsletters and/or important announcements regarding the changes in website, ongoing contests, maintenance downtimes, etc. You Email addresses are safe with us. We won't sell it to anyone! Our newsletters may contain advertising as secondary content, but will never be just advertising mail shots.

#### Other Voluntary Profile Information

We make no use at all of voluntary profile information that you may add to your user account (eg. location, website).

#### Passwords

The password which you use to login to the Forum account is salted and then encrypted before being saved in our database. It's NEVER stored in a plaintext format. This way even we can't see what your password is. And that's why in case you forget your login password, we can't retrieve it for you; we are only able to change it to something else.

#### Visitor Statistics

Visitor statistics and data logged by the server and Google Analytics are used to improve our site. We can quickly see which pages are performing well and which of them are not. Some statistics like Total Visitors, Unique Visitors, Aggregate PageViews per month are released to public. But no personal information is ever revealed.

#### Cookies

Cookies are used to store your personal preferences for a short time. They are used to customise the content that is served to you on the Forum (primarily) and/or other site's sections. Cookies are also used to store your site login credentials. (So you may or may not face difficulties accessing member-only functions, if you login with cookies disabled in your browser)

### Data Security

Appropriate measures (user authentication, authorization, data encryption) are taken to ensure that the data we collect is safeguarded and secure from unauthorized access. Regarding the data submitted in Forum: private profile fields can only be accessed by site administrators, and I.P. addresses attached to the threads/posts can only be accessed by site administrators and moderators.

### Use by children

Protecting very young children's privacy is quite important. For that very reason we currently don't allow account registrations by children under 13 years of age, on our Forum.

### Accessing your Info
