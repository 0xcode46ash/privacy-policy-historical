## Information we collect from you 

We will collect and process the following data about you: 

### Information you give us 

This is information about you that you give us by filling in forms on our site www.arthritisresearchuk.org (“ **our site** ”) or by contacting the helpline or otherwise corresponding with us by phone, e-mail or otherwise. It includes information you provide when you register to use our site, place an order on our site, make a donation to us, participate in a discussion with the Arthritis Virtual Assistant, enter a competition, promotion or survey, take part in our campaign activity, and when you report a problem with our site. The information you give us may include your name, address, e-mail address and phone number, financial, banking and credit card information, as well as sensitive personal data where you volunteer this (see below). 

#### Arthritis Virtual Assistant

We will collect and process all of the information that you give us, as well as the responses given by the Arthritis Virtual Assistant. This may include sensitive personal data where you volunteer this information (see below). 

### Information we collect about you

We collect information about the services you use and how you use them, like when you visit our websites or view and interact with our ads and content, download or order our products.

### Information we receive from other sources

This can include information such as your name, postal address, email address, phone number, your geographic location, credit/debit card details and whether you are a tax payer so that we can claim Gift Aid.  We are able to confirm what browser you are using, IP address and computer operating systems that are being used and this information may be used to improve the services we offer. 

### Website users 

We use cookies and other tracking technologies to ensure that our site works well and to monitor how people use it. We use this information to provide the services and content that you want and to improve the way that our site works. Where possible we use aggregated or anonymous information which does not identify individual visitors. In addition, if you register on our website: 

  * You will no longer be anonymous when you log in and browse our site, and you will remain logged in for 20 minutes from when you last access a page, or until you log out; 


  * We collect and retain information about your shopping cart and transactions with us so that we can process these and deal with future queries. We also collect and store your favourite content, if you want to, so that you can quickly access it again. 



### Debit and credit card information

If you use a debit or credit card to donate to us or buy something online or over the phone, we will ensure that this is done securely in line with the [PCI DSS standards](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/pci_security/ "www.pcisecuritystandards.org \(opens in a new window\)")  by us or our contracted suppliers. All credit and debit card details are securely destroyed once the payment or donation has been processed. 

### Sensitive personal data

A full definition of this is available on the [Information Commissioners website](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/key-definitions/#personal-data "ico.org.uk \(opens in a new window\)")  but this is most likely to be information relating to your health or a medical condition.When you contact the helpline or the Arthritis Virtual Assistant it is likely we will require such information so we can provide an accurate response. In these cases we will record calls for training and quality purposes, and will delete these records after 7 months. We will also give you the option to have the information stored for future records and for statistical analysis. If you contact the helpline by email and post then any data you provide will be processed and recorded automatically but you can request its removal from our records. 

We do not normally collect or process “sensitive personal data” for other purposes without a clear reason for doing so and you are informed and consent to this at the time. You do not need to provide us with information relating to your health to access our services or content, but if you do then we cannot automatically remove this from our records so we may collect and store it but only as part of providing that service or content to you and thereafter for our internal records. You may request we remove sensitive data by contacting the supporter care team, details at the bottom of this page.
