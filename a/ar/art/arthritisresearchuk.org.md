# Our privacy and cookies policy | Arthritis Research UK

**Privacy Policy**

At Arthritis Research UK we are committed to protecting your privacy. This policy is made in the light of the requirements of the Data Protection Act 1998.

If you have any questions about the policy, please write to us at Arthritis Research UK, Copeman House, St Mary’s Court, St Mary’s Gate, Chesterfield S41 7TD or by email [digitalcommunity@arthritisresearchuk.org](mailto:digitalcommunity@arthritisresearchuk.org "Opens email to digitalcommunity@arthritisresearchuk.org").

**How do we collect information?**

We will obtain personal information from you when you enquire about our activities, register with us, request an e-newsletter, make a donation to us or otherwise provide us with personal information.

**What information do we collect?**

The types of information collected might include names, date of birth, e-mail address, postal address, telephone number, fax number and credit/debit card details and, if you consent, some sensitive data.

**How do we use this information?**

We will use your personal information to provide you with the services, products or information you have requested, for administration purposes and, if you have given consent, for fundraising purposes.

We will not sell or swap your details with any third parties but we may share your information with our service providers, agents and associated organisations authorised to act on our behalf to provide the services you have requested.

For instance, when you order literature, buy goods or donate, we may need to pass your information to companies who provide warehousing, mailing, order processing, payment processing and other services for us. However they can only use your information to deliver those services.

We will not share your personal information with third parties or used in any other way other than described in this policy, unless required by law.

You can change your mind at any time by contacting Supporter Services at Arthritis Research UK, Copeman House, St Mary’s Court, St Mary’s Gate, Chesterfield S41 7TD or [digitalcommunity@arthritisresearchuk.org](mailto:digitalcommunity@arthritisresearchuk.org "Opens email to digitalcommunity@arthritisresearchuk.org").

**Sensitive data**

Under the Data Protection Act 1998 any data about an individual’s physical health condition is called sensitive data. The Data Protection Act 1998 requires that we obtain your ‘explicit consent’ to collect such sensitive data. We therefore ask you to tick a box to indicate your consent.

Your sensitive data will be used only for the following purposes: to enable our employees to provide you with information and services appropriate to your interests and preferences, or to enable contracted service providers to provide you with services relating to our communications with you.

We sometimes aggregate statistics about our supporters, donors and customers to enable us to operate more effectively, but these statistics do not include information from which individuals can be identified.

**Do we use ‘Cookies’?**

‘Cookies’ are small pieces of information sent by a web server to a web browser, enabling the server to collect information from the browser. Typically this takes the form of a small text file deposited on your computer’s hard drive.

Arthritis Research UK uses cookies to ensure that you can interact with our website successfully, to identify you when you visit our website and to keep track of your activity patterns. The use of cookies does not give us access to the rest of your computer.

If you want to prevent our cookies being stored on your computer in future, you may do so by referring to your internet browser’s instructions. You can do this by clicking on the “Help” menu. Please note however that if you disable our cookies you may not be able to access certain services or facilities on our website and your use of our site may be restricted.

**How do we protect personal information?**

We use a secure server when you make a donation via our website. We also take appropriate measures to ensure that all the information disclosed to us is kept secure, accurate and up to date and kept only for so long as is necessary for the purposes for which it is given.

Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet is 100% secure. While we make every reasonable effort to ensure that information sent to us is done so securely, we cannot warrant the security of information transmitted to us through the internet. When you transmit information to us via the internet, you do so at your own risk.

**Will we disclose the information we collect to outside parties?**

As indicated above, we may pass your information to our service providers, agents and associated organisations, providing these organisations have satisfied our criteria for information security and data protection. We may need to disclose your information if required to do so by law.

**Accessing and updating your information held by Arthritis Research UK**

If your personal details change, please help us to keep your information up to date by notifying us at: Arthritis Research UK, Copeman House, St Mary’s Court, St Mary’s Gate, Chesterfield S41 7TD.

Arthritis Research UK will correct or remove information it holds about you which you tell us is inaccurate.

Under the Data Protection Act 1998 you have the right to ask for a copy of the information we hold about you (for which we may charge a small fee) and to have any inaccuracies in your information corrected. Such requests need to be made in writing to the address above.

**Changes to this Privacy Statement**

Despite any changes we make to this privacy statement we will always use your personal data for the purposes we outline in this privacy statement unless you give your express consent for us to do otherwise, and in accordance with the Data Protection Act 1998.
