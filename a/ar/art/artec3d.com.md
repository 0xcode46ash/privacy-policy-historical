This Privacy Statement is part of the Terms of Use/License (the “Agreement”) governing the use of the Artec Software (the “Software”) which may operate on any type of computing device and applies to your use of the Software and the www. artec3d. com website (the “Website”). Artec Europe S. a. r. l.

Please read this Privacy Policy before using Artec Services or submitting any personal information on the Site. By using Artec Services, you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Policy. These practices may be changed, but any changes will be posted, and changes will only apply to activities and information on a forward-going, not retroactive basis. You are encouraged to review the Privacy Policy whenever you use Artec Services to make sure that you understand how any personal information you provide will be used.

### Personal information we collect

We receive only the information you knowingly provide to us. We collect your Personal Information (including certain contact and payment data you provide us) when you submit a request or make an order via Artec Services.

If you place an order through Artec Services, we will use your name and email address to send you order verification, shipping confirmation and delivery status emails, as the case may be.

The term “Personal Information” as used in this Privacy Policy shall mean information about you that is personally identifiable to you, like your name, address, email address or phone number, credit or debit card and other billing information, shipping address, as well as other non-public information that is associated with the foregoing.

By submitting Personal Information to us, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy and you expressly and irrevocably consent to the processing of your Personal Information according to this Privacy Policy.

Your Personal Information may be processed by Artec in the country where it was collected, as well as in other countries (including the United States of America) where laws regarding processing of Personal Information may be less stringent than the laws in your country.

### Non-personal information we collect

We may track, collect and report aggregate data regarding user activity and Artec Services usage. Artec may use this data for commercial purposes, but we shall not share any personally identifiable information except as expressly specified herein or in the Artec Terms of Use.

We may collect and use technical data and information about the User’s device and the system and application software incorporated on the device to facilitate the provision of software updates, support and other services to the User (if any) related to Artec Services. We may use this information at our discretion, including to improve our offerings or to provide services.

We may keep track of and store log files of some of the activities you participate in while using Artec Services. In some cases you are also taking an action when you provide information or content to us. When you access Artec Services from a computer or other device, if applicable, we may collect information from that device about your browser type, location, and Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, Internet Service Provider (ISP), pages visited, referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and click stream data. We use this information to analyze trends, to administer Artec Services, to track users’ browsing of the Artec website and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.

We use cookies to store information, such as your personal preferences when you visit the Artec website. (Cookies are specific files that a site or its service provider transfers to your computer’s hard drive through your browser (if you allow that) which enable the site’s or service provider’s systems to recognize your browser and capture and remember certain information).

Personal Information cannot be collected via cookies and other tracking technology; however, if you previously provided personally identifiable information, cookies may be tied to such information. Aggregate cookie and tracking information may be shared with third parties.

### Transactional Data

Certain features such as 3D printing and shipping services are available for Users for a fee. In processing payment for such services we, and our service providers that may be provided such information, will collect certain information necessary to complete your purchase (“ **Transactional Data** ”). This information may include your name, billing address, email address, phone number, and Payment Data.

Payment Data, being a part of the Transaction Data includes your payment instrument number (e. g., credit card, debit card, PayPal), your name and billing address, expiration date and the security code associated with your payment instrument (e.g., the CSV or CVV). Payment Data is used to complete your order, as well as for the detection and prevention of fraud. In support of this use, Artec may share your Payment Data with payment providers, banks and other entities that process payment transactions or other financial services, and for fraud prevention and credit risk reduction. Artec may retain your payment instrument data but not all Payment data for as long as reasonably necessary to complete your existing transaction, to comply with Artec’s legal and reporting requirements, and for the detection and prevention of fraud.

We may retain Transactional Data as long as is necessary to fulfill the purposes specified in this Privacy Policy and for record keeping, subject to statutory or regulatory retention requirements and legitimate business needs. We may collect information related to your transactions performed using Artec Services.

### How we protect your information

To prevent unauthorized access or disclosure, to maintain data accuracy, and to ensure the appropriate use of the information, we utilize appropriate physical, technical and administrative procedures to safeguard the information we collect. All user card information is securely communicated using secure socket layer (SSL) software, which is the industry standard and among the best pieces of software available for secure commerce transactions.

Although we try our best to prevent unauthorized access or disclosure, please be aware that there are risks inherent in sharing information and that no security measures are perfect or impenetrable. We caution you that perfect security does not exist on the Internet. We cannot control the actions of other Users with whom you share your information. We cannot guarantee that only authorized persons will view your information. We cannot ensure that information you share through Artec Services will not become publicly available. We are not responsible for third party circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures of Artec Services.

### Sharing of your information

We do not sell, trade or otherwise transfer to third parties your personally identifiable information except as noted in this Privacy Policy.

We cooperate with law enforcement inquiries, as well as other third parties to enforce laws, such as intellectual property rights, fraud, theft, harassment and other rights. We can (and you authorize us to) disclose any information about you, including the content of your online communications, if we believe in good faith that such disclosure is necessary to (a) comply with relevant laws or to respond to subpoenas or warrants served on us; (b) protect or defend the rights or property of Artec or third parties; (c) assist in an investigation; or (d) respond to an emergency that poses a threat to the safety of Users or other persons.

We may share your information (including but not limited to information from cookies, log files, device identifiers, usage data and 3D scans made by you through the Site) with businesses that are legally part of the same group of companies that Artec is part of, or that become part of that group or companies controlled by Artec (“Affiliates”).

This data reflects website usage patterns gathered during visits to our website each month but does not contain behavioral or identifying information about any individual User, unless that User has given us permission to share that information. We may also provide log files and other databases of user information to third parties for analysis, so we can get a better understanding of traffic through our Site.
