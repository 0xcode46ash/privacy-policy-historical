The instances in which articlesender.com does collect and use information are specifically described in this Privacy Policy.

This Privacy Policy applies to collection, use, storage and disclosure of information by articlesender.com. If there are any exceptions, we will clearly disclose them prior to collecting any information, and will give you an opportunity to choose not to participate or provide the information.

Please see the paragraph below regarding Third Party Banner Ads.

**What information does articlesender.com collect and how is it used? Does articlesender.com disclose information to third parties?**

(a) Traffic or Clickstream Data. Data about traffic and usage is not personally identifying or identifiable, and is not supplemented or combined with personally identifying or identifiable information. articlesender.com may share information it collects with certain selected third parties, but only in aggregated, anonymous form. For example, we may tell an advertiser that a certain number of people visited a certain area on our Web site, or searched Web sites for the term "fly fishing." articlesender.com collects some information regarding use of the Services by observing browser functions and the files (pages) users access.
