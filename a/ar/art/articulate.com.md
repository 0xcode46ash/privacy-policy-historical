# Articulate Privacy Policy

At Articulate we take your privacy seriously. Because of this we want to provide you with explicit information on how we collect and identify information during your visit to our site. This information may be expanded or updated as we change or develop our site. For this reason, we recommend that you review this policy from time to time to see if anything has changed. Your continued use of our site signifies your acceptance of our privacy policy. 

**“Personally Identifiable Information”** refers to information that tells us specifically who you are, such as your name, phone number, company name, email, or postal address. In many cases we need this information to provide the personalized or enhanced service that you have requested. 

The amount of Personally Identifiable Information that you choose to disclose to Articulate is completely up to you. The only way we know something about you personally is if you provide it to us.

**What information do we collect and how do we use it?** Articulate collects information on our users two ways: by your voluntary submissions (for instance, if you sign up for one of our email newsletters or submit a trial request) and through cookie technology. 

The information Articulate collects is used in a variety of ways: for internal review; to improve the content of the site, thus making your user experience more valuable; to notify you about updates; to provide you information you have requested; and to let you know about our products and services.

**Email:** When requesting information or a trial of our software, you may be asked to provide your email address. You never have to provide your email address, and you can decline this exchange of information at any time. If you have provided us your email address, please note that Articulate periodically sends emails about services offered by Articulate. If you do not wish to receive email information from Articulate, let us know by emailing us at: [privacy@articulate.com](mailto:privacy@articulate.com). 

**Cookies:** Articulate may automatically collect non-Personally Identifiable Information and data through the use of “cookies.” Cookies are small text files a website uses to recognize repeat users, facilitate the user’s ongoing access to the site and facilitate the use of the site. “Cookies” also allow a site to track usage behavior and compile site-usage information that will allow for the improvement of content.

**Your Consent:** By using our website, you consent to the collection and use of the information described in this privacy policy by Articulate. 

**Disclosure:** Our policy is not to disclose Personally Identifiable Information to unrelated third parties unless required to do so by law or legal process. Articulate, at its sole discretion, reserves the right to make exceptions to this policy in extraordinary circumstances (such as a bomb or suicide threat, or instances of suspected illegal activity) on a case-by-case basis. 

**Compelling Obligation:** Although Articulate will take reasonable measures not to disclose information about you or the contents of your communications, we may be compelled to do so in the good-faith belief that such action is reasonably necessary (a) to comply with the law; (b) to comply with legal process; (c) to enforce these terms and conditions; (d) to respond to claims that any content violates the rights of third parties; (e) to facilitate the terms of an acquisition of Articulate by, or merger with, another company; or (f) to protect the interests of Articulate or others. 

**Non-U.S. Residents:** In an effort to best serve you, your trial download or contact request may be routed to an authorized Articulate partner in your area.
