**Information that we collect and how we use it**

**Information sharing**

We will not sell or rent your personal information to companies or individuals outside of Art House. In addition, we will only share your personal information with other companies or individuals outside Art House in the following circumstances:

As necessary to process any transactions and maintain your account. As with any credit card payment, if you process a credit card transaction through the service, we need to share some information (for example, your name and credit card number) with the banks and other entities in the financial system that process credit card transactions. Some such entities require a telephone number in order to process a transaction. In those cases, we will share your telephone number with those entities. 

To detect, prevent or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues.

We have your consent. We require opt-in consent for the sharing of any sensitive personal information.

We provide such information to our subsidiaries, affiliated companies or other trusted businesses or persons for the purpose of processing personal information on our behalf. We require that these parties agree to process such information based on our instructions and in compliance with this Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures.

We have a good faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of such information is reasonably necessary to (a) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request, (b) enforce our Terms and Conditions, including investigation of potential violations thereof, (c) detect, prevent or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues or (d) protect against imminent harm to the rights, property or safety of Art House, its users or the public as required or permitted by law.

If Art House or its subsidiaries become involved in a merger, acquisition or any form of sale of some or all of their assets, we will provide notice before personal information is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.

**Information security**

We take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of data. These include internal reviews of our data collection, storage and processing practices and security measures, as well as physical and technical security measures to guard against unauthorized access to systems where we store personal data. 

The security of your account also depends on keeping your account password confidential and you should not share your account name or password with anyone. If you do share your account information with a third party, they will have access to your account and your personal information.

**Accessing and updating personal information**

You can review and update your information by logging in to your account and going to the “Edit Account” page. You can also view your previous transaction history on the ”Edit Account” page.

You can disable your account by contacting us at accounts@arthousecoop.com. If you do so, your account information will no longer be viewable through Art House, and at your request, we will remove your personal information from any metadata or labels attached to materials you have submitted to us. However, such materials will remain available through the Services, and in order to meet our reporting and auditing obligations and to detect, deter, and prevent fraud or other misconduct on our systems, your account information will be retained in our systems. If you disable your account, your personally identifiable information will not be used by Art House or shared with third parties except for these purposes. We may delete these records over time if permitted or required by law.
