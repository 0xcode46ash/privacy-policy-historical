# AoPS Privacy Policy

**Privacy Policy**

We take the privacy of our participants very seriously; therefore, we only collect the information necessary to provide educational services efficiently. To post information in a forum, to participate in any chat room, or to attend electronic classes, you must become a member of the Art of Problem Solving Community. To become a member, the only personal information we require is your email address. You then select your own user name and password, which are both needed to log on. (The user name which you select is used as an onscreen name to identify you; it should not be your real name, but a pseudonym.) We do ask about your general geographic location, your occupation, and interests, but none of this information is required for membership in the Community. 

Your email address is used for us to send messages to you. We do so to confirm your user name and password if you should forget your user name or password. Should you enroll in an Art of Problem Solving online class, your email address will be used
