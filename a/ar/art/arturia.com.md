# Arturia - Privacy policy

##### Last revised: May 25, 2018

At Arturia, we care about your privacy. For this reason, we collect and use personal data only as it might be needed to help us deliver our services to you. We also need information about you when you use our softwares and our licensing software, Arturia Software Center ("ASC"). Your personal data includes information such as: 

  * Name
  * Address
  * Telephone number
  * Date of birth
  * Email address
  * Other data collected that could directly or indirectly identify you.



Our Privacy Policy is intended to describe to you how and what data we collect, and how and why we use your personal data. It also describes options we provide for you to access, update or otherwise take control of your personal data that we process.

If at any time you have questions about our practices or any of your rights described below, you may reach our Data Protection Officer (“DPO”) and our dedicated team by contacting us at privacy-inquiries@arturia.com. This inbox is actively monitored and managed so that we can deliver an experience that you can confidently trust.

Likewise, we’ve also created a Privacy Center to provide answers to your most common questions, quick links to access your MyArturia settings, instructions on how to exercise certain rights that might be available to you, and definitions to key terms and concepts noted in this Privacy Policy.

### What information do we collect?

We collect information so that we can provide the best possible experience when you use our services. Much of the mandatory personal data, usually indicated with an asterisk (the symbol *) is collected directly from you when you:

  * Purchase any of our services (ex: billing information, including first and last name, address, phone number in case of physical purchases)
  * Create an account (first and last name, email address)
  * Register a product (serial number and unlock code of the product)
  * Request assistance from our support team (first and last name, email address, phone number)
  * Complete contact forms or request newsletters or other information from us (first and last name, email address)
  * Participate in contests and surveys, apply for a job, or otherwise participate in activities we promote that might require information about you.



When participating in any of these activities, other optional information may be asked of you. Any data input not followed by an asterisk is optional. If you do not wish to provide us with this information, you are free to leave the field blank.

We also collect additional information when delivering our services to you to ensure necessary and optimal performance. These methods of collection may not be as obvious to you, so we wanted to highlight and explain what these might be, as they vary from time to time, and how they work. These methods are detailed below:

Account related information is collected in association with your use of our services, such as purchases, data linked to registration, transfer, activation and deactivation, be it online or offline of our products through the means of the Arturia Software Center. This usage data can be shared with other Arturia services, such as information requests, customer service requests, and notes or details explaining what you asked for and how we responded.

Cookies and similar technologies on our websites allow us to track your browsing behavior, links clicked, items purchased, your device type, and to collect various data, including analytics, about how you use and interact with our services. This lets us provide you with more relevant product offerings, a better experience on our sites, and to collect, analyze and improve the performance of our services. We may also collect location and system data in the form of your IP address, metadata, log files, and cookie/device IDs when you access our services so that we can personalize our service to you.  
This information includes specific data about your interactions with the features, content and links contained within the services, including browser name and version, the date and time the services were used, the type of device used to access the services, the name you defined for it, what operating system is used, custom unique device identifiers and error data. Some of this data collected might be capable of and be used to approximate your location. For additional information, and to learn how to manage the technologies we utilize, please refer to the “Cookie Policy” in our Privacy Center. 

Data from the Arturia Software Center (ASC) is collected in order to permit the use of our software. This mandatory data includes the used device name, its OS, CPU and RAM information, IP address and a custom unique identifier. The Arturia Software Center lets you optionally share usage information of our services. If you choose to accept this, it may send us the usage frequency of the Arturia licensed software titles activated on the machine, the version of the software titles and the Digital Audio Workstation ("DAW") in which you use it. This information lets us tailor our services to match our customers needs, so that you receive the best experience possible.

### How we utilize information.

We strongly believe in both minimizing the data we collect, and limiting its use to the following purposes:

  * To analyze data which we have been given permission to access, to improve our services
  * To deliver the services you purchase or interact with
  * For legal compliance or other lawful purposes.



Here are a few examples of how Arturia uses this information:

Delivering, improving, updating and enhancing the Services we provide to you.   
We collect various information relating to your purchase, use and/or interactions with our services. We utilize this information to:

  * Improve and optimize the operation and performance of our services (again, including our websites
  * Diagnose problems with, and identify any security risks, errors, or required enhancements to the services we provide
  * Detect and prevent fraud and abuse of our services and systems
  * Collect aggregate statistics about use of the services. This information is not linked with any one personal account, but could be considered “personal data”, so we treat it accordingly.
  * Understand and analyze how you use our services and what products and services are most relevant to you, if you allow us to do so within the Arturia Software Center.



Sharing with trusted third parties.  
We may share your personal data with trusted third party service providers as necessary for them to perform services on our behalf, such as: 

  * Processing payments
  * Physically shipping services to you
  * Serving advertisements
  * Conducting contests or surveys
  * Performing analysis of our services and customer demographics
  * Communicating with you, such as by way email or survey delivery
  * Customer relationship management.



We only share the minimal personal data necessary for any third party to provide the services as requested or as needed on our behalf. These third parties and any subcontractors are subject to strict data processing terms and conditions and are - without your consent - prohibited from utilizing, sharing or retaining your personal data for any purpose other than as they have been specifically contracted for.

Communicating with you.  
We may contact you directly regarding products or services you have purchased from us, where it may be necessary to deliver transactional or service related communications. We may also contact you through a third party service provider with offers for additional services we think you’ll find valuable if you give us consent, or where allowed based upon legitimate interests. You don’t need to provide consent as a condition to purchase our goods or services. These contacts are currently limited to emails.

You may also update your subscription preferences with respect to receiving communications from us and/or our partners by signing into your MyArturia account, and hitting the “Edit” button in the “My Login Info” section under the “My Account” heading.

Transfer of personal data abroad.  
Currently, all our servers that may store personal data are located in France. Some of our services providers may need some of this personal data in order to ensure their service, and they may store personal data outside of France, or outside of the European Union. In these cases, your personal data is handled according to the Privacy Shield Framework, or in accordance with a Data Protection Agreement between Arturia and the service provider. To learn more about the Privacy Shield Framework, visit the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Privacy Shield List.

For your peace of mind, you may wish to learn how companies we share data with utilize your information, and comply with the GDPR. The list of companies we partner with can be found in our Privacy Center.

Compliance with legal, regulatory and law enforcement requests.  
We cooperate with government and law enforcement officials and private parties to enforce and comply with the law. We will disclose any information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate to respond to claims and legal process (such as subpoena requests), to protect our property and rights, to protect the safety of the public or any person, or to prevent or stop activity we consider to be illegal or unethical.

To the extent we are legally permitted to do so, we will take reasonable steps to notify you in the event that we are required to provide your personal information to third parties as part of legal process.

Website analytics.  
We use multiple web analytics tools provided by service partners such as Google Analytics or Facebook to collect information about how you interact with our website, including what pages you visit, what site you visited prior to visiting our website, how much time you spend on each page, what operating system and web browser you use, and network and IP information. We use the information provided by these tools to improve our services. These tools place cookies in your browser to identify you as a unique user the next time you visit our website. Each cookie cannot be used by anyone other than the service provider, Google for Google Analytics, for example.

The information collected from the cookie may be transmitted to and stored by these service partners on servers in a country other than the country in which you reside. Though information collected does not include personal data such as name, address, or billing information, the information collected is used and shared by these service providers in accordance with their individual privacy policies. You can control the technologies we use by managing your settings through our Cookie Policy or the ‘cookie banners” that may be presented, depending on URL of website visited, when you first visit our web pages. You may also control these settings by using third party privacy tools such as Disconnect, Ghostery, and others.

Targeted advertisements.  
Targeted ads or interest-based offers may be presented to you based on your activities on our webpages, and other websites, and based on the products you currently own. These offers will display as varying product banners presented to you while browsing. We also partner with third parties to manage our advertising on our webpages and other websites. Our third party partners may use technologies such as cookies to gather information about such activities in order to provide you with advertising based upon your browsing activities and interests, and to measure advertising effectiveness.

If you wish to opt out of interest-based advertising and do not live within the European Union, [click here](https://www.arturia.com/).

  * needed to maintain adequate and accurate business and financial records.



If we cannot detect any activity in your account within 7 years, we contact you using your last known email address. Not answering this email will lead to the suppression of your account and all personal data associated with it that’s not necessary to our legal or business purposes.
