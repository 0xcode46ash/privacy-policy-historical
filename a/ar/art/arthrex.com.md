# Arthrex - Privacy Policy

This statement sets forth ARTHREX's Privacy Statement for ARTHREX.com and describes the practices that ARTHREX will follow with respect to the privacy of users of this site. 

If you have any questions about this privacy statement, the practices of this site, or your dealings with this Web site, feel free to contact our webmaster at: webmaster@arthrex.com

**What is personally identifiable information?**

"Personally identifiable information" is information about you, such as name, address, e-mail address, user ID, mailing address, and so on. 

**How is information collected, used, and disclosed?**

We do not collect personal information -- including your e-mail address -- unless we first ask you for it. On some of our sites, we may request that you voluntarily supply us with information, including your e-mail address, street address, telephone number or other information so that we may enhance your site visit or follow up with you after your visit. 

If you have voluntarily provided information, you consented to the collection and use of your personally identifiable information as described in this Privacy Statement.Â We do not sell or rent personal information collected through this site to anyone. 

During the period you are logged onto our site we log IP addresses, browser and platform types, domain names, access times, referral addresses, and your activity while using or reviewing our site. ARTHREX may also disclose information in special cases when we have a good faith belief that such action is necessary to:   
(a) conform to legal requirements or comply with legal process;  
(b) protect and defend our rights or property;   
(c) enforce the Web site Terms and Conditions of Use; or   
(d) act to protect the interests of our users or others. 

**What are your choices regarding collection, use, and distribution of your information?**

If you have voluntarily provided information, you consented to the collection and use of your personally identifiable information as described in this Privacy Statement. If, in connection with your use of a particular service, we ask to use your data in a way not described in this Privacy Statement and you do not wish to permit that use, you can choose not to use the particular service.

If you have voluntarily provided personally identifiable information, we may, from time to time, send you mail or e-mail regarding products and services. If you do not want to receive such offers and mailings, you can easily indicate that by checking the appropriate box on the submission form. 

**How can you correct, access, and update your information?**   
You may view and edit your personally identifiable information at any time by contacting us using the link provided on the web site. Or if you prefer, you may contact our webmaster at: webmaster@arthrex.com. 

**How do we protect your information?**

We exercise great care to protect your personally identifiable information. This includes, among other things, using industry standard techniques such as firewalls, encryption, intrusion detection and site monitoring. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personally identifiable information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or receive from us. This is especially true for information you transmit to us via e-mail. We have no way of protecting that information until it reaches us. Once we receive your transmission, we make our best effort to ensure its security on our servers. 

Internally, we will restrict access to your personally identifiable information to employees who need access to the information in order to do their jobs. These employees are limited in number, and are committed to our privacy policies. We will review our security arrangements from time to time as we deem appropriate. If we make changes to this privacy policy, we will post the changes on this page so that you always will know what information we collect, how we use it, and when and how we will disclose it. 

**How can you help protect your information?**

If you are using a ARTHREX web site for which you registered and chose a password, we recommend that you do not divulge your password to anyone. We will never ask you for your password in an unsolicited phone call or in an unsolicited e-mail. Also remember to sign out of the registered site by closing your browser window when you have finished your work. This is to ensure that others cannot access your personal information and correspondence if others have access to your computer. 

**What about links to other sites?**

ARTHREX sites may contain links to other sites, including those of our business partners. While we seek to link only to sites that share our high standards and respect for privacy, we are not responsible for the privacy practices employed by other sites.
