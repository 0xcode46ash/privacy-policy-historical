####  What are cookies and Web beacons?

To facilitate easy navigation within the site, we or our service provider(s) may use cookies (small text files stored in a user's browser) or Web beacons (electronic images that enabling counting visitors who have accessed a page or certain cookies) to collect aggregated data, such as IP address, domain, browser type and pages visited.

Our cookies and Web beacons do not collect personally identifying information. Cookies can be rejected, but users may be denied access to some parts of the site if their browsers reject cookies. 

####  How is personally identifying information used?

Personally identifying information is used only for limited purposes. Personally identifying information about patients, including personally identifying health information, is used consistent with the Research Subject Information and Consent Form. For example, such information shared with your physician, used for research, and aggregated so that medical providers can compare medical outcomes over a broad patient population and for use in clinical studies that may be published. If you have voluntarily provided personally identifiable information, we may, from time to time, send you mail or e-mail regarding products and services. We will ensure that our marketing activities comply with applicable law. You may at any time request that we discontinue sending you such materials. 

####  When is personally identifying information disclosed to third parties?

Personally identifying information is disclosed to third parties only in limited circumstances. Personally identifying information about patients, including personally identifying health information, is disclosed consistent with the Research Subject Information and Consent Form. For example, we will disclose your personally identifying health information to your surgeon for purposes of treatment and research. Consistent with the Research Subject Information and Consent Form, we may also disclose anonymized information for publication of outcomes of clinical trials. We do not sell or rent personally identifying information collected through this site to anyone. Personally identifying information may be transmitted internationally for the purposes identified above. This may include transfer to countries without data protection rules similar to those in effect in your country of residence. By providing information to ARTHREX through this site, you are consenting to such transfers. Where appropriate, personal information may be disclosed to law enforcement, regulatory or other government agencies, or third parties where necessary or desirable to comply with legal or regulatory obligations or requests or for the purposes identified above.

####  How do we protect your information?

We exercise great care to protect your personally identifiable information. This includes, among other things, using industry standard techniques such as firewalls, encryption, intrusion detection and site monitoring. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personally identifiable information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or receive from us. This is especially true for information you transmit to us via e-mail. We have no way of protecting that information until it reaches us. Once we receive your transmission, we make our best effort to ensure its security on our servers. Internally, we will restrict access to your personally identifiable information to employees who need access to the information in order to do their jobs. These employees are limited in number, and are committed to our privacy policies. You have the right as an affected individual to be notified following a breach of unsecured Protected Health Information. We will review our security arrangements from time to time as we deem appropriate. If we make changes to this privacy policy, we will post the changes on this page so that you always will know what information we collect, how we use it, and when and how we will disclose it. 

####  How can you help protect your information?

If you are using an ARTHREX web site for which you registered and chose a password, we recommend that you do not divulge your password to anyone. We will never ask you for your password in an unsolicited phone call or in an unsolicited e-mail. You should also remember to sign out of the registered site by closing your browser window when you have finished your work to ensure that others cannot access personally identifying information. 

####  What about links to other sites?

ARTHREX sites may contain links to other sites, including those of our business partners. While we seek to link only to sites that share our high standards and respect for privacy, we are not responsible for the privacy practices employed by other sites. 

####  Children's Privacy Protection

ARTHREX understands the importance of protecting children's privacy in the interactive online world. The site covered by this privacy policy is not designed for or intentionally targeted at children 13 years of age or younger. It is not our policy to intentionally collect or maintain information about anyone under the age of 13.

Ideas and laws about medical privacy vary around the world. This site operates under United States law, medical ethics, and privacy laws. We may transfer any information on this site internationally for any of the purposes mentioned in this notice. Transfers may involve the transfer of your information between jurisdictions and outside of the jurisdiction in which you submitted your information, including to jurisdictions which the European Union may not deem to provide "adequate" data protection. Please do not provide us any information that you do not wish to be transferred for these purposes. 

####  Will this Privacy Statement change?

ARTHREX reserves the right to modify or amend this Privacy Statement at any time and for any reason. Nothing contained herein creates or is intended to create a contract or agreement between ARTHREX and any user visiting the Web site or providing identifying information of any kind.
