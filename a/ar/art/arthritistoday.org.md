# Privacy Practices

### ONLINE PRIVACY POLICY

The mission of the Arthritis Foundation is to improve lives through leadership in the prevention, control and cure of arthritis and related diseases. The Foundation’s Web site is an important tool in carrying out our mission. We want you to be comfortable and confident when you use the Web site and, for that reason, we have adopted this privacy policy.

  * Collection and use of information



We collect two kinds of information, site usage data, which is not individually identifiable, and individually identifiable information.

  * Site usage data



Our Web server automatically recognizes and collects the domain name of each visitor to our Web site. We collect information about visitors to our site, such as the number of visitors, what pages they access, and the length of their visit. This information is used in aggregate form in order to manage our Web site and improve its content.

  * Individually identifiable information



We collect individually identifiable information about you when you choose to share information about yourself, for example, when you make a donation, request information or sign up to be an advocate. This information may include your postal or e-mail address, your telephone number and the type of arthritis you have.

Individually identifiable information is used to provide you with information or to deliver the service you have requested. If you provide your postal address, telephone number or e-mail address to the Arthritis Foundation online, you may receive any of the following periodic contacts from us:

  * Mailings with information about additional arthritis and arthritis-related resource programs, services and events from the Arthritis Foundation.
  * Mailings that invite you to join the Foundation, to subscribe to our award-winning magazine _Arthritis Today_ , or to help the Foundation achieve its mission.
  * _Mind, Body and Spirit_ , our electronic newsletter.
  * Telephone contact with information about orders you have placed online, as well as additional arthritis and arthritis-related information.
  * Telephone contact to invite you to join the Foundation, to subscribe to _Arthritis Today_ , or to help the Foundation achieve its mission.
  * E-mail contact to respond to your questions, comments or suggestions.
  * E-mail contact to alert you to arthritis news updates, products and services of the Foundation.



If you would like to change the way we contact you, please fill out the [Privacy Preference Form](https://web.archive.org/web/20021205114811id_/http%3A//www.arthritis.org/resources/PrivacyForm.asp).

At certain parts of some of our site, only persons who provide us with the requested personally identifiable information will be able to use tools or otherwise participate in the site's activities and offerings.

We also may collect certain non-personally identifiable information when you visit some Web pages or fill out forms such as the type of browser you are using (e.g., Netscape, Internet Explorer), the type of operating system you are using, (e.g., Windows '95 or Mac OS) and the domain name of your Internet service provider (e.g., America Online, Earthlink).

**Community Tools**

Some portions of our site provide special services and offer interactive tools that allow users to upload information for public consumption. In some cases, users can share experiences, give advice and connect with others. This privacy policy does not apply to RA Connect. Please remember that chat rooms, message boards and personal pages are public forums and personal information disclosed there will be seen by others. In addition, please exercise caution when posting information or providing information about yourself to others, especially contact information, such as street address, telephone number or email address. For more on the use of the RA Connect, please refer to the [Frequently Asked Questions](http://communities.arthritis.org/faq/) page for that section of the site.

**Cookies**

We use a technology called a "cookie" to recognize you when you return to our site. Cookies help make your visit more convenient and enjoyable however, if you wish, you may direct your browser to reject cookies. For more information, see our [Site Help Tips](https://web.archive.org/resources/sitehelptips.asp).

**Sharing Information with Others**

From time to time, the Arthritis Foundation makes postal addresses available to other reputable organizations whose products, services or activities may be of interest to you. The Foundation carefully screens all organizations before allowing the use of our list; the list is never sold. If you do not want us to share your postal address with other companies or organizations, please fill out the [Privacy Preference Form](https://web.archive.org/web/20021205114811id_/http%3A//www.arthritis.org/resources/PrivacyForm.asp).

At times we may offer content (e.g., contests, sweepstakes, or promotions) that is sponsored by or co-branded with identified third parties. By virtue of these relationships, the third parties may obtain personally identifiable information that visitors voluntarily submit to participate in the site activity. The Arthritis Foundation has no control over the third-party's use of this information.

We will also share personal information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law, enforce our rights, or protect the safety of our users or others.

**Email Communications**

We occasionally send out an email newsletter and direct email communications to Arthritis Foundation site visitors to highlight news, information and opportunities available from the Arthritis Foundation. You can elect not to receive communications from us, either by completing our [privacy preference form](https://web.archive.org/web/20021205114811id_/http%3A//www.arthritis.org/resources/PrivacyForm.asp) or by noting your preference in response to communications from us. In addition, all Arthritis Foundation e-newsletters and direct email communications have easy-to-follow unsubscribe instructions at the bottom of each email.

**Links to Other Sites**

Our site provides links to other Web sites where you can find out more about our sponsors or products. Please note that the Foundation is not responsible for the information practices of linked sites. We encourage you to review the privacy policy of each site you visit.

**Children online**

This site is intended for use by adults. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.

**Security**

In order to prevent unauthorized access and protect our users’ personal information, we strive to maintain physical, electronic and administrative safeguards to secure the information we collect online. For example, online shopping and contributions are processed using Secure Socket Layer (SSL).

**Privacy Policy Changes**

If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes here. We encourage you to review our policy from time to time.

**Questions or Concerns**

Whenever you have any questions or concerns, please contact us through any medium you prefer. Your complete satisfaction in dealing with the Arthritis Foundation is important to us. If you have questions about the Arthritis Foundation’s privacy practices described above, please send an e-mail message to our [Customer Service Manager](mailto:lsmith@arthritis.org?Subject=Privacy%5FQuestions). Thank you.

If you have general questions about arthritis, please send messages to Arthritis Answers.
