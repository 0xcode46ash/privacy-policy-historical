## Privacy Policy Overview

We understand your need to maintain your privacy when using the Internet for your communication, shopping, exploration, and play. To make sure you understand our approach to online privacy issues, you MUST read this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use as a condition to using the ARTISTdirect Network.

We ask you for your personal information when you sign up for our mailing list, when you make a purchase, download music, participate in any community features, access ticket pre-sales or enter a contest or sweepstakes. We also may ask you various questions about your interests or preferences. We use this information to personalize the Site for you, to inform you about or offer you new features or services customized to your preferences, for marketing purposes, to contact you about your purchases, or to notify you if you have won a prize or contest. 

We'll give you the choice whether to receive email or other contact from us and from any of the companies we work with, and we give you the opportunity to unsubscribe from receiving unwanted communications (click here for instructions.) Also, we provide the opportunity for you to update and/or correct information we have about you (click here for instructions.) 

We do not sell your personally identifiable information. We may, however, share it with companies that help us operate the Site, such as our credit card companies and the company that packages and ships our merchandise for delivery to you. We might also share it with prize providers for our sweepstakes and contests. If you've given us your permission, we may share your personal information with other companies that provide products or services we think will be of interest to you, and we may send you information in connection with the musical preferences you have selected. We use industry-standard efforts to safeguard any personal information, and any financial information we receive from you is encrypted. However, we may be required to release personal information about you as a result of a law suit or subpoena or as immediately necessary to protect our rights or the rights and safety of other users. Remember though, "perfect security" doesn't exist on the Internet. 

For a complete discussion of the terms of our Privacy Policy, please see the FAQ below. This Privacy Policy is incorporated into and subject to our Terms of Use. ARTISTdirect may modify this Privacy Policy at any time. You are responsible for reviewing our Privacy Policy before using the Sites or providing any information.

## Frequently Asked Questions

## What information do we collect?

The information we collect that falls into one of two categories - personally identifiable information and aggregated information. Personally identifiable information is information that can be used to identify you. Aggregated information is information that is not associated with a specific user, but instead anonymous information on many users, such as the number of visitors to the Site in a month's time. We collect personally identifiable information (such as name, email, residence address, and credit card information) whenever you voluntarily submit it to the Site. Examples of information that you submit voluntarily include: when you make a purchase, answer our polls, enter sweepstakes or contests, fill out the registration page, send us feedback, download music, or post in our chat rooms or to our message boards. If you register, we might also ask you about your musical preferences or other information to customize the Site for you. You always have the option of choosing not to reveal this personally identifiable information to us, although certain services may be unavailable if you do not. In the event of a complaint, we may also receive and collect personally identifiable information about you from other users or third parties who may communicate information to us about you in relation to such a complaint. In addition, we collect and store statistics and other information about the online activities of our visitors on an aggregated (collective) basis. For example, we track the number of people who view each page, the order in which pages are viewed, and other information to learn which features are the most popular and to refine our design and marketing efforts.
