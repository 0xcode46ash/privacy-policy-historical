The Internet is an online community that allows unparalleled access to knowledge, worldwide communication, and commerce. Community is built on trust and inherent in trust is the concept of your right to privacy -- the Internet is no different. According to the [**Truste Privacy Partnership**](http://www.truste.org/), you have the right to choose what information you want to access or share, and to know what will happen to that information once divulged. This site adheres to this pledge.
