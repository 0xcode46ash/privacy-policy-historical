You may have the opportunity to ask us to provide your information to these promotional affiliates.

However, we cannot ensure that they abide by our privacy policies. Art.com Technologies is the sole owner of information collected through the Service.

 **Information That Is Personally Identifiable**  
Our registration format requests certain contact information from our Users. We collect information that is personally identifiable through the registration and purchasing process when processing your order.

Such information may also be used to assess your satisfaction with and to obtain feedback regarding the Service we provide and to tailor the visitor's experience while visiting our Web site.

Aggregated data may be used by us to improve our Service and for marketing purposes, and may be shared with and used by advertisers and other third parties.
