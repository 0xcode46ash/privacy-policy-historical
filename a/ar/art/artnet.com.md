This registration form requires users to supply their contact information (e.g., name and address) and financial information (e.g., credit card number). In addition, Bookstore customers have the option to fill out an order form in the Bookstore section of the site to purchase items from the Bookstore without registering through Member Services.

We use this customer contact information to send information to our registered users about the services for which they have subscribed. We use the financial information collected to verify the user's identity and to bill the user for products and services. It is optional for users to provide demographic information (such as income level and art interest), but we encourage users to provide this information so that we can provide a more personalized experience on our web site.
