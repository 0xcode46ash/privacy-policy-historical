I do sometimes use the non-personally identifiable information that is collected to personalize your experience on my site. This information, when combined with that of others, is used to track site usage, to improve the site or to improve the content. The aggregated information I collect is also useful in deciding which products or services you may find the most appealing.

You are responsible for checking the privacy policy of EACH site you visit because they may differ from this one. I have no control over any information that is collected by sites that I do not completely own.

I reserve the right to run advertising, contests or surveys where you enter information on my site and that information may be made available to a third party. You will be notified BEFORE you submit your information whether it is a situation where your data may be made available to another party.
