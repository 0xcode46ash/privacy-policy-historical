# Privacy Policy | Aruba Networks

_Statement last updated: May 2012_

Aruba Networks respects the privacy of personal information obtained from our customers, partners, resellers, distributors, and visitors to our website, and is committed to protecting that personal information. This Privacy Statement (the “Statement”) describes how we handle and view the personal information of visitors to our website(s) and applies to Aruba Networks, Inc. and all of its subsidiaries worldwide. By using this website, you expressly consent to the practices and activities described in this Statement. Capitalized terms that are not defined in this Statement have the meaning given to them in our Terms of Use.

#### Aruba Networks Collection of Information

Personal information means any information that may be used to identify an individual, including, but not limited to, a first and last name, a national identification number, an email address, postal or physical address or other contact information, occupation, industry or other information needed to answer a request, to better provide information and services or to comply with various national, state, provincial or local government reporting requirements.

The submission of personal information is voluntary. Aruba Networks may collect personal information fairly and lawfully as described below. In each case, we only collect personal information that we believe to be adequate, relevant, not excessive and required to provide an individual with requested information and services and/or to conduct our business. In addition, we may store personal information in locations outside the direct control of Aruba Networks (for instance, on servers or databases co-located with hosting providers). As we develop our business, we may buy or sell assets or business offerings. Customer, email, and visitor information is generally one of the transferred business assets in these types of transactions. We may also transfer or assign such information in the course of corporate divestitures, mergers, or dissolutions.

**Aruba Networks may collect personal information for purposes that include but are not limited to:**

  * Viewing/accessing of white papers, technical briefs or product demonstrations
  * Participation in marketing promotions, events, webinars, seminars, podcasts, teleconferences, executive roundtables, direct mail or general marketing activities
  * Career opportunities or other Human Resources activities
  * User surveys
  * Use of our password protected “Channel Partner Site” portal
  * Responding to an inquiry
  * Providing product-oriented technical support or consulting services



In addition, when accessing certain documents or services on our website, visitors may be asked to provide certain information, such as how they can be contacted, where they work, and what they do. We may also track non-personal information (see also ‘Cookies and Why We May them’ in this Statement) about the web pages and content accessed by users of our website and the number of times such content is accessed by a specific visitor. Aruba Networks collects this non-personal information in an effort to improve the quality of its website and also to answer questions as well as improve delivery and quality of information to visitors to its website. The data and information we collect from cookies may be aggregated with other personally identifiable information which may allow us to identify specific users of this website and track their website usage.

#### Sharing, Disclosure and Security of Personal Information

If you choose to provide Aruba Networks with personal information, your personal information will be used by and transferred to Aruba Networks, its offices and subsidiaries, its resellers, distributors and service providers which are those companies contracted by Aruba Networks to deliver requested information and services. We may also transfer personal information internationally to the aforementioned parties. All such entities are governed by this Statement or are bound by appropriate confidentiality agreements.

An individual’s personal information is typically not shared outside Aruba Networks without permission, except under conditions explained below. We will ask for your consent before we use or share your information for any purpose other than the reason you provided it or as otherwise provided by this Statement. Aruba Networks may send personal information to other service provider companies under any of the following circumstances:

  * When we have an individual’s consent to share the information;
  * If sharing an individual’s information is necessary to provide a product or service that is requested (if personal information is shared with third parties, we will only provide the information they need to deliver the service. In addition, such companies are prohibited from using such personal information for any other purpose);
  * As part of a joint sales promotion or to pass sales leads to one of our distribution partners; and
  * To keep an individual up to date on the latest product announcements, product updates, special offers or other information we think you would like to hear about either from us or from our service providers.
  * We will also disclose personal information if required or permitted to do so by law, or in urgent circumstances, to protect personal safety, the public or our websites.
  * To investigate, prevent or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected or potential fraud, brand protection matters (e.g. use of Aruba Networks’ trademarks without a license), situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of Aruba Networks’ Terms of Use, or as otherwise required by law.



Aruba Networks safeguards the security of the personal information and other data provided to us with physical, electronic and managerial procedures. Inside Aruba Networks, data is stored in secure and controlled servers with limited access. Your information may be stored and processed in the United States or any other country where Aruba Networks, its subsidiaries or service providers are located. While we strive at all times to protect personal information, we cannot ensure the security of the personal information provided to us. You can help protect your Aruba Networks online services account by choosing a strong password and changing it regularly. Passwords you use on our sites should be different from any other websites you may use.

We will only retain your personal information to fulfill the purposes for which is was collected or as required for legitimate purposes or permitted by law.

If you choose to provide third party personal information (such as name, email and phone number), we will assume that you have the third party’s permission to provide us with the information. This information will not be used for any other purpose.

#### Cookies and Why We May Use Them

A cookie is a small file, stored by a web browser that helps with record keeping. A web server may ask the web browser for the information stored in these cookies, and instruct it to modify, delete, or add to the contents of the cookie. Information in a cookie can include forms you have filled-out, your login information, and your website preferences. The main purpose of cookies on Aruba Networks websites is to identify visitors and, where applicable, provide customized content. Cookies helps us recognize you as a unique visitor when you return to a Aruba Networks website, and to allow us to tailor content to match your specific preferred interests, while avoiding the display of the same dynamic content repeatedly. They also help us develop leads for our internal sales group and business partners, provide direct marketing communications to you if you have explicitly consented to receive such communications, and compile statistics that allow us to understand how users use our website and help us improve the structure of our website. Your personal identity, however, is not available via these statistics.

Two types of cookies may be used on Aruba Networks websites: Session cookies (which are temporary cookies that remain in the cookie file of your browser until you leave the website) and persistent cookies (which remain in the cookie file of your browser for much longer, though how long usually depends on the lifetime of the specific cookie).

#### You May Disable or Enable Cookies at Any Time

You have the ability to enable or disable cookies by modifying the settings in your browser (you may need to consult your browser’s help file), as well as delete any cookies that have been installed in the cookie folder of your browser. However, you may not be able to use some of the interactive features of our website if cookies are disabled/deleted.

#### Information Logged During a Web Session

Various pieces of information are automatically reported by your browser when you access a web page. Our web servers may record this and other information automatically in log files. These server logs may include information such as your Internet (IP) address, the web page that you clicked on to arrive at an Aruba Networks website, the type of browser you are using, your computer’s operating system, the web request details, what pages you viewed or clicked on, and other information.

#### Clear Images or Web Beacons

When you use the website, we may employ clear images (also known as web beacons) which are used to track the online usage patterns of web visitors. In addition, we may also use clear images in HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by recipients. The information is used to enable more accurate reporting, improve the effectiveness of our marketing, and make Aruba Networks’ services better for our users.

#### Information About Customer Networks

In addition to the foregoing, Aruba Networks may, in the course of performing services for customer, obtain access to a customer’s network or systems and in certain cases, may be able to view or receive portions of personal information of customer’s clients. Aruba Networks does not and will not use this information, and if indirectly collected as part of the performance of services, all such information is safeguarded in accordance with this Statement.

#### Third Party Websites

Aruba Networks’ website may, from time to time, provide links to other third party websites which are outside our control and not covered by this Statement and may be different from this Statement. We encourage you to review the privacy policies posted on these third party websites.

#### Privacy of Minors and Children

Our websites do not and will not target and are not intended to solicit or attract children. Aruba Networks does not knowingly solicit personal information from children or send them requests for personal information. For the purposes of this document, a child means anyone under the age of 13.

#### International Data Transfer

As Aruba Networks is a global organization, we may transfer information that we collect about you, including personal information, to affiliated entities, or to other third parties acting on our behalf, across borders and from your country or jurisdiction to other countries or jurisdictions around the world for the purposes of processing or storage. If you are located in the European Union or other regions with laws governing data collection and use that may differ from U.S. law, you fully understand and unambiguously consent to the transfer, processing and storage of your personal information, to a country and/or jurisdiction that does not have the same data protection laws as your jurisdiction, and you unambiguously consent to the transfer of your personal information to the U.S. and the use and disclosure of information about you, including personal information, as described in this Statement.
