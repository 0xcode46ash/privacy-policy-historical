# Privacy policy | Aruba, a Hewlett Packard Enterprise company

**Introduction**

Aruba Networks, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively, “Aruba”) are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring you have a positive experience on our websites and in using our products and services (“Solution” or “Solutions”). This Privacy Statement applies to our Solutions with websites or agreements that link to this Statement, but does not apply to those Aruba Solutions with websites or agreements that have their own privacy statement. Our handling practices for Personal Information are set forth in this Privacy Statement, in the supplements to this Privacy Statement and in the notices we provide to you at the point of collection.

This privacy statement should be read in conjunction with privacy supplements which we publish from time to time and any other notice which we provide to you.

We know that your privacy is important to you, so this Privacy Statement explains:

  * How we collect information and what information we collect.
  * How we use, disclose, transfer and store the information we collect.



By using our Solutions, you consent to the collection, use, and disclosure of the information we collect in accordance with this Privacy Statement.

We have tried to keep this Privacy Statement as simple as possible. To assist in your review, here are a few important terms we use in the Privacy Statement and the meanings we give to them:

  * **Solutions:** When we refer to “Solutions” in this policy, we mean any product, service, network, device, platform, software, apps or website offered by us to you or that you may make available to your customers, employees or visitors.
  * **You:** When we say “you” in this policy, we mean you, your employees, your visitors and any other individuals you let use or access our Solutions.
  * **Aruba:** When we say, “we”, “Aruba” or “us” we mean either Aruba Networks Inc. or one of its worldwide subsidiaries – please see “ ** _Who we are_** ” below in this regard.
  * **Personal information:** When we talk about “Personal Information”, we mean information that can be used to identify you, such as your name, address, email address or phone number. “Personal Information” does _**not**_ include depersonalized or aggregated information. Aggregated information is information that we collect about a group or category of products, services, users or individuals who access our Solutions that is not personally identifiable or from which individual entities are removed. We may use and disclose aggregated information, and other non-personally identifiable information, for various purposes at our sole discretion and without notice or liability to you.liability to you.



**How do we collect information and what information do we collect?**

We collect Personal Information and other information when you provide it to us.  For example, when you contact us or when a device connects to an Aruba Solution, we collect information – this can happen both automatically and when we ask you to provide information to us. While you frequently will know when you are using our Solutions, in some cases your device (or the devices of your employees, visitors and other end-users) may do so automatically.

**_Collection of Voluntarily-Provided Information   _**

We collect information that you provide to us in a variety of ways.  These include the following:

  * _User Accounts and Profiles_.  Some of our Solutions may allow you register for an account or to create and update a user profile.  If we offer user account or profile functionality on a Solution, we will collect the Personal Information that you provide to us in the course of registering for the account or creating or updating a user account or profile.  This information may include, for example, name, postal address, email address, telephone number, credit card information, promotional preferences, age and, potentially, related demographic information about you.  We may indicate that some Personal Information is required for you to register for the account or to create the profile, while some is optional. ****
  * _Logging into Networks_.  Certain networks using our Solutions may require users to establish or use login credential.  In connection with supporting this log-on functionality, we may collect information such as email addresses, telephone numbers, usernames, passphrases and passnames, in each case to facilitate the log-on functionality and otherwise operate or deliver our Solutions.  Likewise, if you access our website, we may also log information about you, including your Internet Protocol (IP) address, access times, browser type and language, ISP, the pages and content on our website you use and the URL of the webpage you visit.
  * _Correspondence_.  If you contact us by email, using a contact form or by other means, we will collect the Personal Information contained in and associated with your correspondence.
  * _Chatrooms_.  If you participate in an Aruba discussion forum or chat room on an Aruba website, you should be aware that the information you provide there will be collected by us and will be made broadly available to others, and can be read, collected or used by other users of these forums both inside and outside of Aruba.
  * _Newsletters_.  We may email newsletters from time to time relating to our Solutions.  If you sign up to receive a newsletter from us, we will collect your email address.
  * _Customer Support_. Many of our customers choose to provide information to us when they request technical support.  ****



**_Collection of Passively-Provided Information_** __

We also collect information (both Personal Information and non-Personal Information) on you automatically.

For example, when you access certain of our Solutions, we may automatically collect your browser’s Internet Protocol (IP) address, your browser type, the nature of the device from which you are accessing our Solutions (e.g., a personal computer or a mobile device), identifiers for any handheld or mobile device that you may be using, the Web site that you visited immediately prior to accessing any Web-based Solutions, the actions you take once connected to our Solutions, and the content, features and activities that you access and engage with on our Solutions.  We also may collect information regarding your interaction with email messages from us, such as whether you opened, clicked on, or forwarded a message.

We may collect this information passively using technologies such as standard server logs, cookies, and clear GIFs (also known as “Web beacons”).  We use passively-collected information for a variety of reasons, including to administer, operate, maintain and improve our Solutions and our other services and systems and to provide content that is tailored to you.

When you use a location-enabled Aruba service, we may collect, process, use and share information about your actual real-time geographic location, such as signals sent by a mobile device.  We may also use various technologies to determine location, such as sensor data from your device that may, for example, provide information on and to nearby Wi-Fi access points.

If we link or associate any information gathered through passive means with Personal Information, or if applicable laws require us to treat any information gathered through passive means as Personal Information, we treat the combined information as Personal Information under this Privacy Statement.  Otherwise, we use and disclose information collected by passive means in aggregated form or otherwise in a non-personally identifiable form.

You can exercise choices regarding our use of your Personal Information:

  * **Promotional Communications** : We will only send you promotional communications where we are permitted to do so by applicable law. If you do not want to receive promotional communications from us, you can change your preferences by following the instructions on the communication (e.g. clicking unsubscribe in an email), though in some cases you will still receive certain mandatory service / product related emails.
  * **Cookies:** If you do not want us to store or otherwise use cookies on your computer, your browser may offer tools to disable or reject cookies (though you may not be able to use some website features if you do so).
