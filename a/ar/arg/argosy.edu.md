The Argosy University Web site is designed for users from the United States. Users from other countries are advised not to disclose personal information to the Argosy University unless they consent to having their information used as set forth in this Web site’s Privacy Policy rather than under the law of user’s home country.

In general, you can visit this Web site without telling us who you are or revealing any information about yourself. Our Web site tracking software collects the domain names but not the email addresses of visitors. Domain name information that we collect is not used to personally identify you, but is used to measure the number of visits, average time spent on the site and the pages viewed. We use this information to measure the use of the site and improve the content delivered on the site.  
When you make a request for further information from Argosy University, you are asked to provide certain contact information that is collected and used for the purpose of responding to your request. The information collected from you may include your name, address, telephone number or email address.  
We collect personal information you submit pursuant to the registration and purchasing processes of our Web site. If you e-mail us, you are voluntarily releasing information to us.     
In addition, we may have collected similar information from you in the past.  We use that historic information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. By using our web site you are consenting to our continued use of any such information.   
When you make a request for further information and provide Argosy University with your personal contact information, that information is collected and used for the purpose of responding to your specific requests. We do not share, sell or lease personal information about you except as set forth in this Web site.

Unless you specify that you would prefer not to hear from us, we may also use the information you provide to the Argosy University web site to contact you.    
We use the aggregate and specific information from users to develop statistics that are helpful to us in understanding how our Web site is used, and how we can continue to improve it. The personal information you send to us is typically used to respond to your inquiries, to process your requests, or to allow you to access specific information. We share your information with affiliated schools and with our parent company and with other affiliated businesses that are notified of our Privacy Policy. We DO NOT sell, rent or give your personal information to any non-affiliated third parties, except as described in this notice. We may also transfer your personal information to companies that perform services on our behalf or to companies that we believe may offer you related services or products that may be of interest to you. We notify businesses to which we transfer your personal information that the information was shared with us under this Privacy Policy.  If you tell us that you do not wish to have this information used for further contact, we will remove you from our distribution list.
