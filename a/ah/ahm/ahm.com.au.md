For example, we will need your name and residential address in order to provide you with private health insurance coverage or a dental or optometry service.

#### Use of Commonwealth Government identifiers

We will not use Commonwealth government identifiers, such as Medicare numbers, as our own identifier of individuals. We will only use or disclose such identifiers in the circumstances permitted by the Privacy Act.

#### Transfer of personal information overseas

If we transfer your personal information outside Australia, we will comply with the requirements of the Privacy Act that relate to transborder data flows.

#### Access to your information and contacting us

### The Spam Act 2003

The Spam Act 2003 provides the requirements for the sending of legitimate commercial electronic messages and prohibits the sending of unsolicited commercial electronic messages, whether by email, instant messaging, short messaging service (SMS), or multimedia messaging.

#### Compliance

ahm Health Insurance has educated its staff on the requirements of the legislation and implemented guidelines for sending commercial electronic messages. We also have good security practice measures in place to ensure that our system or network is not "spoofed" or used by others to send Spam and to deal with messages that are sent by mistake.

We do not use electronic address harvesting software or lists that have been generated using such software, in connection with sending unsolicited commercial electronic messages. We will only send you electronic messages with your consent, including consent inferred from our existing relationship. For example, as a member of the fund, where we communicate with you in relation to your membership.

#### Unsubscribing

You are able to unsubscribe from any ahm Health Insurance mailing list. You can request to be removed using the unsubscribe facility contained within each electronic communication. Alternatively, please email [info@ahm.com.au](mailto:info@ahm.com.au) or call us on **[134 246](tel:134246)** providing details of the communication which you no longer wish to receive and request to be removed from that mailing list.

If you have any questions about ahm and our compliance with the Spam Act, or if you want to report any suspected spamming activity, please contact us on **[134 246](tel:134246)** or email us [info@ahm.com.au](mailto:info@ahm.com.au). We will investigate the matter promptly and advise you of the results. If you are unhappy with our response, you can lodge a complaint with the Australian Communications and Media Authority.
