You can contact us anonymously. However, if you choose not to be identified we are very limited in our ability to insure you, pay claims or offer you services.

**Your privacy and personal information is important to us and we will do each of the following:**

  * Only collect, use and disclose personal information about you that is required in the provision of information about or the promotion or delivery of our products and services to you; administration of ahm’s business; business analysis; or to meet any legal obligations imposed on ahm (Purpose). 
  * Only disclose your personal information to third parties for a Purpose and with whom we have entered into an agreement that gives you (or that the law requires to give you) at least the same level of protection to your personal information as we do.
  * Only use de-identified information for any statistical or other analysis or similar research purposes.
  * Only disclose your information to a third party in connection with a product or service offered by that third party with your prior consent.

    * To investigate claims.
    * For the administration or delivery of health insurance, health management programs , dental services and related products and services. 
  * Use only fair and lawful ways to collect personal information.

We may also need to ask for it from another health fund, if you are looking to transfer your membership. We may contact a service provider who has treated you in the past, if the information is likely to be relevant to your current treatment. 
  * Collect personal information directly from you if it is reasonable and practicable to do so.
  * Allow the contributor (the person who pays the premium) to have complete information on all aspects of the policy, including benefits claimed under the policy. This may include disclosing your sensitive information. This is required under our contract with the contributor. We send all communications on policies that cover more than one person to the address supplied by the contributor.
