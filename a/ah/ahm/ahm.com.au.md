## Web site information collection and dissemination practices

We use your IP (Internet Protocol) address to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer our web site. We analyse our web site logs to improve the relevance of content featured on the site. While these logs are IP identifiable, no attempt is made to link them with any individuals that browse the site. The site uses cookies simply to ensure a persistent client state. We also send session numbers and keys as cookies to ensure that your connection, when using our online services, is kept as secure as possible.

## Registration Forms 

The site’s registration form requires users to provide contact information (such as name; email; and postal address). This information is stored on a database that allows us to send out email list updates and serves as a mechanism for members to sign-on to our online services (refer below). The contact information is also used by us to get in touch with the site visitor when necessary.

## Online Forms

This site uses forms for customers to request information and transact with the fund. We collect information (such as email address); financial information (such as account and/or credit card numbers); and demographic information (such as postcode or age).

## External links

This site contains links to other sites. We are not responsible for the information handling practices or content of these external sites but we do endeavour to monitor these sites to ensure that they are appropriate to our site, its visitors and members.

## Discussion Groups (mailing lists)

This site makes discussion groups available to its users (mailing lists). Any information disclosed in this media becomes public information and you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal information. Your email address is not publicly available to anyone until you send a message to these lists. At this point, visitors are informed that they may reply personally if they feel a reply to the list is inappropriate.

We also maintain several email lists to keep subscribers informed about areas of specific interest. Individuals must request to join our mailing lists by signing up through our web site. We do not sell, rent, loan, trade, or lease the addresses on our lists to anyone. 

## Web site access by children

This site encourages children to obtain their parent’s permission before sharing personal information online.
