The American Historic Society   
Privacy Statement

I. General 

  
The American Historic Society respects the privacy of every individual who visits our websites or responds to our interactive advertisements. This Privacy Statement outlines the information the American Historic Society will collect and how we will use that information. This statement will also instruct you on what to do if you do not want your personal information collected or shared when you visit. 

  
II. Personally-Identifiable Information 

  
In order to fulfill and service your order, we will need to collect basic information about you - name, address, phone, e-mail address, etc. You will also need to provide payment information.

If you do not want your personally-identifiable information collected, please do not submit it to us. If you have already submitted this information and would like for us to remove it from our records, please contact us by submitting a "Feedback" or contacting our Customer Service. We will use reasonable efforts to delete your information from our existing files.

When you do provide us with personally-identifiable information, we may use that information in the following ways, unless stated otherwise:   
We may need to store and process that information to better understand your needs and how we can improve our products and services.   
We may use that information to contact you.   
We may provide that information to third parties.  
The personal information you have provided us and information about your order may be shared with third parties. This information may be combined with other personally identifiable information (such as demographic information and past purchase information) available from our records and other sources. This information will be used to make our future marketing efforts more efficient. It may also be used by our marketing partners to bring you offers of interest. If you prefer we do not share your name and address with marketing partners, please contact us by submitting an email through our "Feedback".

If you agreed to receive email from our marketing partners, we will share with them your email address and the information described above, so they can send you offers for products and services that may be of interest to you. We will only share your email address if you have opted in by checking the box on the registration page. Additionally, each email our partners send you will include a description of the simple opt out process to enable you to stop receiving future email.

  
III. Children 

  
The American Historic Society has no intention of collecting any personally-identifiable information (that is, your name, address, telephone number, or email address) from individuals under eighteen years of age. Where appropriate, The American Historic Society will specifically instruct children not to submit such information on our websites or advertisements. If a child has provided us with personally-identifiable information, a parent or guardian of that child should contact us at the email address or phone number listed in the Customer Service Numbers if they would like this information deleted from our records. We will use reasonable efforts to delete the child's information from our existing files.
