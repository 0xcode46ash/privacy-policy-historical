# Privacy Policy | Australian Women's Weekly

**The Australian Women’s Weekly Website Privacy Policy**

Bauer Media Limited ABN 18 053 273 546, whose principal place of business is 54 Park Street, Sydney NSW 2000 (“Bauer”) owns and operates the theaustralianwomensweekly.com.au website (“Website”). This Privacy Policy applies to online privacy issues and therefore it is to be read as forming part of the terms of use for the Website, which are available at [www.theaustralianwomensweekly.com.au/terms-conditions](http://www.aww.com.au/terms-conditions/)

 **1     Privacy**  
At Bauer, we are committed to protecting and maintaining your privacy. We are bound by the principles in the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) (“Privacy Act”). As part of our normal operations we may collect your personal information.   
This Privacy Policy is designed to tell you as much as possible about how Bauer uses, discloses and manages personal information provided to, or collected through the Website. We believe you should be made aware of our practices so you can make informed decisions about how you allow us to use your personal information.  
In this ever-changing world, Bauer may from time to time review and update this Privacy Policy to take account of new laws and technology, or changes to Bauer’s operations. All personal information held by Bauer will be governed by the most recent policy. The most recent Privacy Policy will always be available on our Website at www.theaustralianwomensweekly.com.au/privacy.aspx or by contacting the Bauer Privacy Officer at the address below.  
Any questions regarding this Privacy Policy or complaints regarding how we handle your personal information should be sent to Bauer’s Privacy Officer at 54 Park Street, Sydney NSW 2000.

 **2     What kind of personal information does Bauer collect and how does Bauer collect it?**  
The types of personal information we collect will vary depending on the nature of your dealings with Bauer (and our agents, contractors and third parties).   
Bauer collects most information directly from you.  In most cases we collect this information so you can use our Website and post opinions, comments and reviews.  We may also collect information so you can request a product or service from Bauer and third parties, redeem special offers from Bauer and third parties making such offers, complete a survey or questionnaire, enter a competition, seek employment, or communicate with Bauer by e-mail, telephone or in writing.  
Sometimes we may collect personal information to assist in identifying ways in which Bauer can service you better, such as providing our products and services to you more effectively, and to assist our internal administration and operations, including accounting, risk management, record keeping, archiving and staff training.   
In general, the type of personal information Bauer collects and holds could include (but is not limited to) your name, address (postal and/or email), phone number and other contact details, gender, details relating to your use of the Website (e.g. reviews and comments you post or contributions to discussions) and any preferences you tell us about.

 **3     How Bauer uses Personal Information**  
Bauer uses personal information for the primary purpose for which it is collected and for other secondary purposes that are related to the primary purpose.    
In general, Bauer uses personal information for the following secondary purposes:  
•    to provide offers and information to persons who sign up to receive them from Bauer;  
•    to provide other products or services which are requested from Bauer, including advertising services;  
•    to process and administer our dealings with you;  
•    to develop processes, products and services to better meet your needs;   
•    to help Bauer manage and enhance its products and services and the offers made to persons who use the Website;  
•    to communicate with online users of its offers;  
•    to provide people with ongoing information and advertising about Bauer's products and services in which they may have an interest; and  
•    unless requested not to, Bauer may provide your personal information to third parties which may in turn provide your personal information to other third parties for marketing purposes.  
In many cases where Bauer asks you to provide us with personal information, if you do not provide Bauer with that personal information Bauer will not be able to provide you with the relevant product or service.  
If you have opted in to receive newsletters, communications or special offers from Bauer you may, in some circumstances, also receive newsletters, communications or special offers from the third party providing the special offer. You can change your communications preferences with Bauer at any time. If you are contacted by a third party their opt-out of receiving further communications will be governed by their privacy policy.

 **4     Links to Third Party Websites**  
To the extent that the Website contains links to sites operated by third parties and not related to Bauer products, services or events (“Linked Websites”), the Linked Websites are not controlled by Bauer and we are not responsible for the privacy practices of those companies. Before disclosing your personal information to Linked Websites, we advise you to examine their privacy policies.

5  **    Third Party Advertisements Online**  
To try and bring you offers that are of interest to you, Bauer has relationships with other companies that we allow to place advertisements on our web pages. If you visit our Website, advertisement server companies may collect information such as your domain type, your IP address and clickstream information.

 **6     Cookies and IP Addresses**  
The Website uses cookies.  Cookies are pieces of information that a website transfers to your computer's hard disk for record-keeping purposes. Most web browsers are set to accept cookies. However, if you do not wish to receive any cookies, you may set your browser to refuse them. In some instances this may mean you will not be able to take full advantage of parts of the Website.   
The use of cookies can enhance your enjoyment of what we offer, because they help us personalise your experience of the Website by providing information which is most relevant to your interests. Cookies provide us with aggregated information on how users interact on the Website, track which advertisements are effective and help us improve your experience on our Website. Cookies do not personally identify you, but your browser. One of the primary purposes of cookies is to store your preferences and other information on your computer in order to save you time by eliminating the need to repeatedly enter the same information and to display your personalised content. For example, your email address may be stored in a cookie that will remain on your computer after you sign out. This cookie allows your email address to be pre-populated, so that you will only need to type your password the next time you sign in.   
Cookies may also be passed in affiliate links from the Website to third party websites. None of your personal information is tracked, stored or shared within that cookie or shared between the third party website owner and us. Affiliate cookies only track whether a successful event or sale occurred from our referral link.   
We also log your IP address in order to help diagnose problems with our server, administer our Website and track usage statistics.  Your IP address may vary each time you visit, or it may be the same, depending on the type of internet connection you use to access the Website.  Either way, it would be extremely difficult for us to identify you through your IP address, and we make no attempt to do so.  If you reached our Website by clicking on a link or advertisement on another website, then we also log that information.  This helps us to maximize our internet exposure, and to understand the interests of our users.  All of this information is collected and used only in the aggregate; that is, it is entered into our database, where we can use it to generate overall reports on our visitors, but not reports about individual visitors.

7    To whom might Bauer disclose Personal Information?  
Bauer may disclose personal information it collects about you for a variety of purposes in connection with providing its products and services and special offers to you (including to our agents, contractors or to a related company). Bauer may provide your personal information to:  
•    organisations who are sponsoring, organising or otherwise involved with or participating in an offer, promotion, competition or survey;  
•    other companies or individuals Bauer engages to perform functions on behalf of Bauer such as for production functions, printing functions, data analysis, telemarketing, research and advertising; and  
•    anyone you authorise Bauer to disclose personal information to.  
Bauer may decide to buy or sell assets which form part of or relate to its business. In any such transaction, personal information will usually be one of the transferred assets and will be disclosed to the purchaser.  
Where we disclose personal information to third party contractors, agents or related companies, we take steps to ensure that those agents, contractors or related third parties:  
•    comply with the applicable principles in the Privacy Act when they handle personal information about you (regardless of whether they are a small business and may otherwise be exempt from those principles); and  
•    are authorised only to use personal information in order to provide the services or to perform the functions we require.   
Otherwise, we only disclose personal information if required or permitted to do so by law or if the disclosure is permitted under the Privacy Act.

 **8     How does Bauer treat Sensitive Information?**  
In referring to 'sensitive information' Bauer means information relating to a person's racial or ethnic origin, membership of political bodies, religions, trade unions or other professional or trade association, sexual preferences, criminal record and health information.  
If you decide to provide Bauer with sensitive information, it is Bauer’s policy that this information will be used and disclosed only for the purpose for which it was provided or a directly related secondary purpose, unless you agree otherwise or use or disclosure of this information is allowed by law.

 **9     Management and security of personal information**  
We take physical, electronic and managerial steps to ensure that the personal information we hold is secure from unauthorised access, destruction, use, modification or disclosure.  We only permit your details to be accessed by authorised personnel and we educate our staff about their responsibilities under the Privacy Act.  Bauer has also appointed a Privacy Officer to oversee Bauer’s management of personal information in accordance with this policy and the Privacy Act.   
Additionally, we take reasonable steps to destroy or permanently de-identify personal information when we no longer need it.  We also impose strict requirements of security and confidentially on all third parties as to how they store, handle and deal with personal information.   
In striving to ensure that the security, integrity and privacy of personal information submitted to our site is maintained to the highest level, Bauer regularly reviews and updates its security measures in light of current technologies.  Unfortunately, no data transmission over the internet can be guaranteed to be totally secure and you need to be aware of this when using our Website. 

**10     Non-customer information **  
Sometimes, Bauer needs to collect personal information about individuals who are not customers. This will usually arise where we collect the name and business contact details of a person who is the contact in a government agency or company with whom we deal. Bauer's policy is to only use personal information collected from non-customers for the main business purpose for which it was collected.

 **11     Transborder data flows**  
Some of Bauer’s third party contractors and service providers may perform some of their services overseas.  For instance, a third party contractor may utilise a server hosted overseas as a method to send emails to Bauer customers.  In all instances where this occurs, Bauer takes reasonable steps to ensure that all personal information is handled in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy.

**12     Updating Personal Information**  
Bauer endeavours to ensure that the personal information it holds is accurate, complete and up-to-date. Bauer encourages you to contact it as soon as possible in order to update any personal information it holds about you. Bauer's contact details are set out below.

Under the Privacy Act, you have the right to obtain access to any personal information which Bauer holds about you and to advise Bauer of any perceived inaccuracy.  There are some limitations to this right set out in the Act, which mean that we can refuse to provide you access to that information in limited circumstances, including where granting you access might have an unreasonable impact on the privacy of other individuals, if the request is frivolous or vexatious; and if the information relates to anticipated legal proceedings.  
To make a request to access any personal information Bauer holds about you, please contact Bauer in writing as set out below. Bauer will require you to verify your identity and specify what personal information you require.  Bauer may charge a fee to cover the cost of verifying your application and locating, retrieving, reviewing and copying any material requested. If the personal information sought is extensive, Bauer will advise of the likely cost in advance and can help to refine your request if required.

 **13     How to contact Bauer **  
If you would like to make an access request or wish to provide feedback about this policy, please contact Bauer by writing to Bauer’s Privacy Officer at the address specified above, or via e-mail to privacyofficer@bauer-media.com.au.
