# Australian War Memorial

In accordance with the [Guidelines for Federal and ACT Government World Wide Websites](http://www.privacy.gov.au/issues/p7_2.html) issued by the Australian Privacy Commissioner, the Australian War Memorial provides the following privacy statements.

### Site visit data

Our server makes a record of your visit and logs the following information for statistical purposes:

  * the user's server address
  * the user's top level domain name (eg. .com, .gov, .au, .uk etc.)
  * the date and time of the visit to the site,
  * the pages accessed 
  * documents downloaded
  * the previous site visited and 
  * the type of browser used. 



No attempt will be made to identify users or their browsing activities except, in the unlikely event of an investigation, where a law enforcement agency may exercise a warrant to inspect the service provider's logs.

### Cookies

'Cookies' are small amounts of information that are created and stored on the user's system, and used by the Web host server for a variety of possible purposes. 

The Australian War Memorial's Collection Databases use 'cookies' in order to retain search parameters and results during an enquiry session. You will need to [set your browser to accept 'cookies'](https://web.archive.org/web/20020409031050id_/http%3A//www.awm.gov.au/database/cookies.htm) in order to undertake searches and display results within the Memorial's Databases. If your browser supports such an option, you may also use the setting to 'warn before accepting cookies' or 'prompt'. Our Databases will function normally in either 'accept' or 'prompt' modes. 

Information passed between the client and server via these cookies is not retained by the host software in any fashion once the search session is terminated. The only information gathered from the client is that amount necessary to identify that particular session and keep it distinct from the other search sessions that may be happening at any one time.

Cookie information is not retained or forwarded to any other body or organistion and users may have complete confidence that the Australian War Memorial fully respects and applies the principles of privacy and confidentiality over the Internet. 

For more information about the Australian War Memorial's use of cookies in its databases, send an email to [webmaster@awm.gov.au](mailto:webmaster@awm.gov.au)

### Email management - collection of personal information

We will only record your e-mail address if you send us a message. It will only be used for the purpose for which you have provided it and will not be added to a mailing list. We will not use your e-mail address for any other purpose, and will not disclose it, without your consent.

### Security

Because there are risks associated with using the Internet as a transmission medium, when we use electronic forms to collect information we will also provide you with other options for providing the information - for example, a paper form and mailing address and a telephone contact.
