# Australian War Memorial - Privacy Statement

In accordance with the [Guidelines for Federal and ACT Government World Wide Websites](http://www.privacy.gov.au/internet/web/index.html) issued by the Australian Privacy Commissioner, the Australian War Memorial provides the following privacy statements.

### Site visit data

Our server makes a record of your visit and logs the following information for statistical purposes:

  * the user's server address
  * the user's top level domain name (eg. .com, .gov, .au, .uk etc.)
  * the date and time of the visit to the site,
  * the pages accessed 
  * documents downloaded
  * the previous site visited and 
  * the type of browser used. 



No attempt will be made to identify users or their browsing activities except, in the unlikely event of an investigation, where a law enforcement agency may exercise a warrant to inspect the service provider's logs.

### Cookies

'Cookies' are small amounts of information that are created and stored on the user's system, and used by the Web host server for a variety of possible purposes. 

The Australian War Memorial's Collection Databases use 'cookies' in order to retain search parameters and results during an enquiry session. You will need to [set your browser to accept 'cookies'](https://web.archive.org/database/cookies.asp) in order to undertake searches and display results within the Memorial's Databases. If your browser supports such an option, you may also use the setting to 'warn before accepting cookies' or 'prompt'. Our Databases will function normally in either 'accept' or 'prompt' modes. 

Information passed between the client and server via these cookies is not retained by the host software in any fashion once the search session is terminated. The only information gathered from the client is that amount necessary to identify that particular session and keep it distinct from the other search sessions that may be happening at any one time.

Cookie information is not retained or forwarded to any other body or organisation and users may have complete confidence that the Australian War Memorial fully respects and applies the principles of privacy and confidentiality over the Internet. 

For more information about the Australian War Memorial's use of cookies in its databases, send an email to [webmaster@awm.gov.au](mailto:webmaster@awm.gov.au)

### Collection of personal information - Email, phone, address details

The Australian War Memorial is fully committed to protecting your privacy. Any personal information, like your email, phone and address details, will be used to process your request or order. 

From time to time, we may use parts of the data you and other users provide us with to better understand how our services are used and to provide information for future improvements. The data used to do these reviews does not include any direct personal information that identifies you as our customer.

To enhance your online ordering and shopping experience, and to provide a more personalised service to you, we will ask you if we can use your personal information to contact you about upcoming products and items of interest. You will have the ability to choose whether or not you would like to receive this information from the Memorial. You can unsubscribe from this service at any time.

We will not use your personal details for any other purpose, and will not disclose it, without your consent.

### Security

The Memorial wants to ensure that you can purchase online with complete confidence. The Memorial's online purchasing technology uses the National Australia Bank's Secure Internet Payment Service. This employs SSL technology with 128 bit encryption and ensures that your card details are only accessible by NAB, not by the Memorial, and are stored behind their security firewall.
