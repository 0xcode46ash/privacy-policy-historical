**\- Testimonials -**

I just wanted to take a moment to tell you how pleased I am with the Aweber Autoresponder system. I just checked my statistics (online!) after a 7 day vacation, and was blown away when I saw that I was prospecting 150 new leads! I then checked my email and found almost a dozen requests for personal follow-up. This certainly beats the old cut and paste manual follow-ups, and the ability to download the database means a near-perfect integration into my downline management software. Tom, you did a super job - and I expect to take a longer vacation next time! Thanks again.
