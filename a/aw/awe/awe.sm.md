# Privacy Policy | Analytics For Social Media - awe.sm

### A message from awe.sm:

At our core, Snowball Factory is a data company. But not in a creepy way. Our overarching goal is to map the relationships between the publishers of cool content, those who find that content interesting enough to share it with their friends, and the friends who enjoy what's been shared. We use the data we collect to help publishers strengthen these virtuous relationships and create more value for all involved.

(The below Privacy Policy is largely based on [that of Automattic](http://en.wordpress.com/tos/), which they were kind enough to make available under a Creative Commons Sharealike license. So, you are welcome to repurpose it for your own use. But if you do, be a good sport and shout out the team at Automattic with a link to [WordPress.com](http://wordpress.com/) somewhere on your site.)

### Privacy Policy

Snowball Factory, Inc. (" **Snowball Factory** ") operates several websites including **awe.sm** , **tweetpo.st** , and **fbshare.me**. It is Snowball Factory's policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our websites and services.

#### Website Visitors

Like most website operators, Snowball Factory collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Snowball Factory's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Snowball Factory's visitors use its websites. From time to time, Snowball Factory may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its websites.

Snowball Factory also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for individuals interacting with various components of the awe.sm service deployed by customers as described below.

#### awe.sm Visitors

In order to help awe.sm customers deliver more value to their users, we collect data on sharing and consumption data driven through awe.sm. Specifically, we may capture the IP address, referring site, date and time of the request, browser type, and cookie identifier of users who share via an awe.sm-powered sharing interface (like fbshare.me) or who click an awe.sm-powered link or visit a page with awe.sm-powered tracking code.

This information is only made available to awe.sm customers for activity on links or pages associated with their awe.sm account and then only in aggregate non-personally-identifying form, except for potentially personally-identifiable profiles of a given awe.sm customer's content being shared by an individual with a given cookie identifier. However, a visitor can disable our ability to build this sharing profiles by deactivating cookies in their browser.

You acknowledge and agree that Snowball Factory may retain copies of such collected data.

#### Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information

Certain visitors to Snowball Factory's websites choose to interact with Snowball Factory products in ways that require Snowball Factory to gather personally-identifying information.

In certain cases, you may have the option link your account to or sign into your account using third party social networking websites (collectively, the "Social Networks"), such as Facebook. If you choose to sign in through these Social Networks, we use the information you have already provided to such Social Networks in registering for an account with such Social Networks and which you have allowed such Social Networks to share with Snowball Factory, including, but not limited to, your first name, your user profile picture, your friends and contacts list, pages, your gender, and the networks to which you belong (collectively, your "Submitted Information"). You expressly authorize us to collect and use your Submitted Information in connection with your use of the Services. You further acknowledge and agree that Snowball Factory may, but is not obligated to, maintain copies of your Submitted Information indefinitely, or delete any or all Submitted Information, at our sole discretion.

For example, we ask visitors who sign up for TweetPo.st to authenticate with their Facebook account. Those who engage in transactions with Snowball Factory – by purchasing access to the awe.sm service, for example – are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, Snowball Factory collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor's interaction with Snowball Factory. Snowball Factory does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.
