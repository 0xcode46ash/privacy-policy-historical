Information gathered by the collector may also be anonymised and aggregated by Awdit and used to provide general public statistics. Such information will never include personally identifiable data such as usernames or IP addresses - it will be restricted solely to generic information such as the number of times a particular version of software has been detected across our user base.

### 6\. Warranties

The website and service is provided to you 'as is' and we accept no liability for any loss or damage incurred as a result of your use of our service.

From time to time our service may not be available, or may operate with reduced functionality. We will attempt to provide prior warning of any scheduled maintenance through our website, but we cannot be held responsible for any loss or degradation of service, or any consequential loss or damage you may incur as a result.

Any information provided through the use of our service is also provided on an 'as is' basis.

You agree to indemnify us from any liability incurred as a result of your use of our service, or any advice provided through our service.

### 7\. Payments, upgrades and downgrades

Some plans require a monthly subscription. If you are on such a plan you grant us permission to set up a credit card recurring payment to take the required monthly payments.

You may choose to upgrade or downgrade your account at any time by using the upgrade or downgrade mechanism within the service.

If you upgrade from a free to a paying plan you will be required to provide payment details. We will not upgrade your account until payment has been made using the supplied details.

If you change between paying plans we will apply the change to your account immediately, and the new payment amount will take effect from the next due monthly payment. No pro rata payment will be taken or refund given for the part month period between the account change request and the date of the next due monthly payment.

If you downgrade from a paying plan to a free plan we will apply the change to your account immediately, cancel the recurring payment agreement and no future payments will be taken. No pro rata refund for the unused part of the month will be given.

If terminate the recurring card authority which allows us to take monthly payments, initiate a chargeback for any payment or take any other action that prevents us from taking a monthly payment then we reserve the right to suspend or downgrade your account without warning.

Where you owe us money we reserve the right to charge interest at the rate of 8% above the Bank of England base rate. We also reserve the right to add any reasonable collection costs we may incur to your debt.

### 8\. Termination

We may terminate this agreement at any time by emailing the email address provided upon registration.

You may terminate this agreement and cancel your awdit account at any time by emailing support@awdit.com.

If you cancel your account we will use our best endeavours to delete all data you have uploaded to awdit on or shortly after the date you cancel your account. If you subsequently choose to reinstate your account it may not be possible to recover such data once it has been deleted. If you feel this is likely to be the case then please consider downgrading to a free plan rather than cancelling your account completely.

Regardless of which party terminated this agreement you will remain liable for any outstanding unpaid invoices accrued up to the point this agreement was terminated and no pro-rata refunds will be given.

### 9\. Limitation of liability

We provide all services on an 'as-is' basis and accept no liability, either express or implied for any loss or damage incurred as a result of your use of our service, save where required by law.

Nothing in these terms & conditions shall affect your statutory rights under law.

### 10\. Other

If any part of these terms & conditions are found to be unenforceable by a properly constituted court or tribunal this shall in no way affect the remainder of these terms & conditions.

Without prejudice to any other relief available to us, we reserve the right to suspend or terminate your use of our services in the event we believe you to be in breach of these terms & conditions. In such a case we will make reasonable efforts to inform you of our actions after the event.

These terms & conditions may be varied from time to time. Notification of such changes will be made by means of a message on our website. Where such a change is minor and does not fundamentally affect your rights, your continued use of our service will constitute your acceptance of the amended terms & conditions.

Where we make a change to our terms & conditions that may fundamentally alter your rights under this agreement we will make reasonable efforts to notify registered users of such a change within 7 working days, and provide users with an opportunity to terminate any subscription and receive a refund of any remaining subscription. Your right to exercise this option may only be exercised for a period of 30 days after such a change to our terms & conditions.

You may not assign any portion of these terms & conditions, nor any rights or licenses granted under these terms, without our express written permission. We may assign these terms & conditions or any of our rights or license under these terms & conditions at our sole discretion.

Any failure by us to enforce any part of these terms & conditions will not affect our overall right to enforce any part of these terms & conditions, and will under no circumstances constitute a waiver of our rights under these terms & conditions.

No third party rights (whether under the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999 or any other relevant legislation) shall be conferred by virtue of these terms & conditions.

### Security of Data

All data stored in our databases is encrypted using industry-standard encryption algorithms. This includes all user and company information either provided by the awdit network scanner or supplied by users.

### User accounts and passwords

We do not store passwords in any shape or form. Instead we store a one-way hash of your password. When you enter your password we hash the text you have entered, and compare this with the hash stored in our database. If the two match, then access is granted.

By doing this we never have to store your original unencrypted password, and it is computationally impractical to reverse a hash to reveal the original password, even if our database were ever compromised.

One side effect of this approach is that we are unable to tell you your password if you ever forget it. All we can do is generate a new random password and email that to you.
