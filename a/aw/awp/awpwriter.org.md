# AWP: Privacy Policy

AWP works to maintain the privacy of visitors to awpwriter.org. This privacy policy explains AWP’s limited uses of the information we collect from you when you visit the site, create a user account, or purchase a product or service.

## Credit Card Information

AWP does not store credit card information on our website or servers. All payments are processed in a secure third-party gateway.

## Your Email Address

AWP uses your email address mainly to facilitate your purchases and your participation in AWP projects and services. Generally, AWP will not distribute your email address to third parties, but there are two exceptions to this general rule. 

AWP will limit its distribution of your email address to two important services to you and the literary field: (1) surveys of our literary and academic field, and (2) advocacy for public funding of the arts and arts education. To these ends, we share email addresses with consultants, who help us to produce the surveys; and we share email addresses with our partner, Americans for the Arts Action Fund, which advocates for public funding for the arts and arts education. AWP will not distribute your email address to another individual or organization outside the purposes described in this policy.

If you prefer not to receive messages from Americans for the Arts Action Fund, you may opt out by going to My AWP Account and indicating your preference in your [Personal Information](https://www.awpwriter.org/user/personal_profile) settings.

## Demographic Data

Usage data collected by our website and email is not shared, given, or sold to any third party and is used solely by AWP to analyze the website’s usage, calculate membership’s average usage of our email messages, enhance the user’s experience, and verify fair and appropriate use of the services AWP provides.

The optional demographic information we solicit in surveys, at the time of your user account registration, and at the time of conference registration or bookfair exhibit purchase (age, gender, race, employment, role) helps us to tailor communications with our stakeholders and to understand our membership and conference audience. Specific information about any one user is never shared, given, or sold to any third party. Only aggregate statistical data is shared with prospective sponsors, funders, and the public.

AWP sometimes conducts comprehensive surveys of our members in order to gather data on the well-being of creative writing as an academic discipline and the well-being of our teachers, program directors, students, and other literary professionals. Your individual responses are confidential. AWP publishes only totals from aggregate statistical data—average salaries of assistant professors, percentage of African-American professors in creative writing, average class size, for examples. These surveys are important in directing AWP’s future advocacy work for professional standards. 

## Your Street Address

We use your name and USPS address, when applicable, to fulfill your _Writer’s Chronicle_ subscription and to solicit individual donations. From time to time, we make your mailing address available for rental to our peer literary organizations for postal mail solicitations. Please contact us at [awp@awpwriter.org](mailto:awp@awpwriter.org) to exclude your address from any future list rental.
