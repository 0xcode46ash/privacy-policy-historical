# Association of Writers & Writing Programs

AWP works to maintain the privacy to visitors of awpwriter.org. This privacy policy explains what type of information we collect from you when you visit the site, create a user account, or purchase a product or service.

## Gathering of Information

AWP collects personally identifying information, such as your name, email address, address, and affiliation, for a limited number of purposes. We do not share, give, or sell email addresses, which are used exclusively to help us provide information to our members, conference attendees, bookfair exhibitors, and enewsletter recipients. 

We use your name and USPS address, when applicable, to fulfill your _Writer’s Chronicle_ subscription and to solicit individual donations. From time to time, we make your mailing address available for rental to our peer literary organizations. Please contact us at [awp](mailto:awp@awpwriter.org)[@](mailto:awp@awpwriter.org)[awpwriter](mailto:awp@awpwriter.org)[.](mailto:awp@awpwriter.org)[org](mailto:awp@awpwriter.org) to exclude your address from any future list rental.

The optional demographic information we solicit in surveys, at the time of your user account registration, and at the time of conference registration or bookfair exhibit purchase (age, gender, race, employment, role) helps us to tailor communications with our stakeholders and to understand our conference audience. Specific information about any one user is never shared, given, or sold to any third party. Only aggregate statistical data is sometimes shared with prospective sponsors and funders. 

Usage data collected on our website, including your use of the site, is not shared, given, or sold to any third party and is used solely by AWP to analyze the website’s usage, enhance the user’s experience, and verify fair and appropriate use of the services AWP provides. 

We do not store credit card information on our website or servers. All payments are processed in a secure third-party gateway.
