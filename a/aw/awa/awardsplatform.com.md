This following document sets forth the Privacy Policy for Award Force Pty Ltd ("Award Force"), the Award Force awards management system, and the Award Force website www.awardforce.com  ("Service", "System" or "Site").

Award Force is committed to providing you with the best possible experience, which includes the privacy and integrity of your personal data. Award Force is bound by the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth), which sets out a number of principles concerning the privacy of individuals.

If for any reason you do not agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy, you must not use the Award Force Service, System or Site.

## Collection of your personal information

There are aspects of the Services which can be viewed without providing personal information, however, for access to some current and future features you are required to submit personally identifiable information. This may include but is not limited to a unique username and password, or to provide sensitive information in the recovery of your lost password.

All System data is stored on secure servers in Australia.

## Sharing of your personal information

We may occasionally hire other companies to provide services on our behalf, including but not limited to handling customer support enquiries, processing transactions or customer freight shipping. Those companies will be permitted to obtain only the personal information they need to deliver the service. Award Force takes reasonable steps to ensure that these organisations are bound by confidentiality and privacy obligations in relation to the protection of your personal information.

From time to time, we may use customer information for new, unanticipated uses not previously disclosed in our privacy notice. If our information practices change at some time in the future we will use for these new purposes only, data collected from the time of the policy change forward will adhere to our updated practices.
