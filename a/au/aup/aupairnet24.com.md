This information may be used, if required, for providing newsletters, recommendation pages and reviews of service providers.

By using our service, you understand that all profile data that you choose to make visible (potentially including your phone number, if previously indicated) may be used for the purposes of presenting our offer to potential customers via email. For the purpose of decisions regarding the establishment, execution or termination of contractual relationships, we collect or utilise probability data, in the calculation of which address data etc., may also involved.

You will be asked for your explicit consent prior to your data being used for any purpose that requires it. You may withdraw your consent at any time, and exempt future use of your personal data. 

**3\. Additional data use**  
Personal data will not be passed on to third parties unless this is required to execute the service requested. In such cases, you will have either previously provided us with your consent to do so, or the data transfer is subject to relevant statutory provisions that make it necessary.

5\. Use of Cookies**  
Some of our services require the use of cookies. We use cookies to optimise and customise your online experience. A cookie is a text file that is either temporarily stored in computer memory ("session cookies") or saved on the hard drive ("persistent cookie"). Cookies are not used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. The main purpose of cookies is to track your preferences and make the use of our service as simple as possible for you. Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies. However, you can change your browser preferences to refuse cookies if desired. If you reject cookies, not all our services are guaranteed to work smoothly for you.

We use mostly session cookies that are not stored on your hard disk and are deleted when you exit your browser. Session cookies are used primarily for login authentication and load balancing. We also use cookies to track access to Aupairnet24.com from external advertising spaces (ZANOX AG, Netslaves GmbH, Affilinet GmbH, Belboon GmbH). These cookies do not contain personal information about you and and are generally deleted after you log into Aupairnet24.com.co.uk - otherwise, they are automatically deleted after no more than 180 days.

We also use cookies from our partners to track advertisements. These unique cookies are set to track information such as how often an ad has been viewed and this information is forwarded to advertisers. The information sent is anonymised and contains no personal data.

We use "permanent cookies" to track click streams and to automatically determine whether you have, for example, already voted in a poll, responded to an advertising campaign or viewed a message so that we can avoid unneccessarily repeating information you see.

The Aupairnet24.com site uses Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google Inc. ("Google"). Google Analytics uses "cookies", text files that are stored on your computer to help analyze the use of the website. The information generated by the cookie about your use of this site is sent to a Google server in the U.S. and stored there. Google will use this information to evaluate your use of the website, compiling reports on website activity for website operators and providing other website activity and internet related services. In addition, Google may also transfer this information to third parties if required to do so by law or if third parties process the information on Google's behalf. Google will not associate your IP address with any other data held by Google. By using this site, you consent to the processing of data about you by Google in the manner described and for the aforementioned purpose.

You have the right to correct, add or delete the recording of your personal data and user account settings at any time. You are also entitled to withdraw your consent to the collection and storage of further voluntarily submitted data to us at any time - simply send an email to us at Aupairnet24 (info@aupairnet24.com). Please note that in the event of cancelling our permission to store and process your personal data, the personalised service can no longer be offered, as this is based on the use of customer data. 

**7\. No liability for partner websites**  
On our sites we occasionally refer to or link to cooperation partners, who themselves offer websites and web-based services. These sites will usually also have their own privacy statements. These privacy policies are not authored by us and we assume no liability for them. Please ensure that you are familiar with the applicable privacy policy before entering any personal information on a third party site.
