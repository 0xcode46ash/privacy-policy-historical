Only in exceptional cases the whole IP address will be first transfered to a Google server in the USA and truncated there. The IP anonymisation is active on this website.

This website uses the anonymisation functionality of Google Analytics, so the last digits of your IP address will automatically be truncated.

**Akanoo**

This website uses Akanoo, a web analysis service from Akanoo GmbH. Akanoo uses so-called “cookies”. Cookies are text files, which are saved on your computer, and which enable an analysis of the use of the website. The information generated by the cookie is transferred to a server operated by Akanoo GmbH in Germany and stored there. No data processing takes place outside of Germany.

On behalf of AuPairWorld GmbH, Akanoo GmbH will use the information to record and evaluate your use of the website, and to provide additional services to AuPairWorld GmbH related to the use of the website and the Internet. The IP address transmitted to Akanoo by your browser is shortened before being saved, so that it is not possible to directly identify a specific person. Akanoo instead uses a heuristic method, which attempts to link a visitor with a previous visit, by combining specific data e.g. screen resolution, browser, plug-ins used and operating system, and generating a hash value.

You can prevent cookies being saved by means of the relevant setting in your browser software. We would like to inform you that in this case, you may not be able to use all of the functions of the website completely.
