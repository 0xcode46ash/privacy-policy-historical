Defined Terms

For the purposes of this Privacy Policy, the following terms are defined:

  * Personally Identifiable Information – any and all information identifying you personally, such as your name, address, telephone number(s), email address, or company name.
  * Non-Personally Identifiable Information – technical or demographic information, such as your age, gender or interests. Non-personally identifiable information does NOT identify you personally, and may include:
    * Internet Protocol (IP) address – Your IP address is a number to let computers attached to the Internet know where to send data. We use this information to deliver our webpages upon request and to measure traffic within this Site.
    * Cookie – A "cookie" is a small text file sometimes used to collect information about your activity on the Site. For example, when someone visits a page within the Site, a cookie is placed on their machine (if the user accepts cookies) or is read if they visited the Site previously. Users may set their browsers to notify them if they receive a cookie, or they may choose to block cookies with their browser.



Information Collection

When you browse [www.auanet.org](https://web.archive.org/) and do not interact with the site for any online service or product from the AUA, you browse anonymously. Personally identifiable information is not collected as you browse.

When you choose to interact with our site (i.e., subscribing to AUA publications, purchasing an AUA product or service, requesting information or materials, etc.), we will collect certain personally identifiable information from you. The type of information collected will be determined based on the type of product or service you seek, but may include your name, address, phone number billing and delivery information, email address or other demographic information.

Information Use

Once collected, we may use your personally identifiable information and non-personally identifiable information for the following purposes:

  * Register you or complete a transaction for programs and services you have requested
  * Deliver services, such as information, newsletters or other content that may be relevant to your association with the AUA
  * Alert you to special offers, promotions, updated information and other new services from the AUA and other approved third parties
  * Allow you access to limited-entry areas of the Site
  * Answer your emails or online requests



Except as described in this Privacy Policy or at the time we request the information, we do not otherwise use, share or otherwise disclose your personally identifiable information to any third parties.

AUA Emails

The AUA sends "transactional or relational email messages," which include, but are not limited to, electronically transmitted news, informational bulletins, meetings and member-benefit announcements, and surveys. You may opt-out of a specific email list by following the "unsubscribe" instructions of any email message sent to you from the AUA or its component or affiliated organizations. Additionally, the AUA will:

  * Ensure it uses email and mailing lists for AUA operational activities. Additionally, it ensures this email policy—including unsubscribe requests—is strictly enforced.
  * Ensure its email promotional announcements are sent to recipients with an interest in the subject matter.
  * Ensures all promotional announcements contain a marketing-specific subject line, concise promotional copy, accurate reply instructions, a link to the AUA's privacy policy, and clear unsubscribe instructions.
  * Timely honor all "unsubscribe" requests by properly coding the database.



Email addresses are captured during the AUA Annual Meeting registration process. This information is made available to AUA Annual Meeting exhibitors. Registrants may opt out of making this information available to exhibiting companies.

AUA member email addresses are made available to other AUA members through the AUA Member Directory. The AUA does not share, rent or sell email addresses to commercial vendors.

Information Sharing

The AUA may disclose your personal information if required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to legal requirements or comply with legal process served on the AUA; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of AUA; or (c) protect the personal safety of AUA personnel or members of the public in urgent circumstances.

Banner Advertising

Banner advertisements on the AUA's website do not collect any personally identifiable information on individual visitors. The AUA does collect aggregate data on visitors such as time of day and Web browser type, which is shared with advertisers to determine their advertising effectiveness.

Children under 13

We do not knowingly solicit data online from or market online to children under the age of 13.

Information Safeguarding

User ID and Password

Aspects of the Site require the use of a user ID and password. The user ID and password enables the AUA to verify your identity and thereby, allows you access to member information such as your MyAUA account, and prevents unauthorized access.

When you have finished using a secure area of the AUA's website, make sure you always click on the "Log Out" link which appears on every secure page. When you click on the "Log Out" link, you will be given the option to end your secure session. No further secure transactions can be conducted without re-entering your user ID and password. You should be aware, browser software often "caches" a page as you look at it, meaning some pages are saved in your computer's temporary memory. Therefore, you may find when clicking on your "Back" button it shows you a saved version of a previously viewed page. Caching in no way affects the security of your confidential user ID or password.

Links

This Site may contain links to or from other websites, such as those of members, federal agencies, other medical associations, etc. Please be aware the AUA is not responsible for the privacy practices of other websites. This Privacy Policy applies only to the information we collect on the Site. We encourage you to read the privacy policies and any other terms of other websites you link to from the Site.

SSL Technology

The AUA realizes the importance of security, so we've taken a number of steps to enhance the protection of information sent to or from the AUA over the Internet. We require a "secure session" be established, using Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology. This is done any time you supply or access information in one of our secure online areas. SSL technology creates a private conversation only your computer and the AUA systems can understand. The SSL technology encodes information as it is being sent over the Internet between your computer and AUA systems, helping to ensure the transmitted information remains confidential.

No guarantee

Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100 percent secure. Accordingly, and despite our efforts, the AUA cannot guarantee or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us, or to or from our online products or services.

CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS

Beginning on January 1, 2005, California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits our visitors who are California residents to request certain information regarding the AUA's disclosure of personally identifiable information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes.
