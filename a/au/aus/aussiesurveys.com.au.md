This Privacy Policy covers The Great Australian Survey's treatment of personally identifiable information that we collect when you register and complete any surveys with The Great Australian Survey. This policy also covers The Great Australian Survey's treatment of any personally identifiable information that The Great Australian Survey's business partners share with The Great Australian Survey or vice versa.

This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that The Great Australian Survey does not own or control, or to people that The Great Australian Survey does not employ or manage.

When you register with The Great Australian Survey, we ask for your name, email address, birth date, gender address, and marital status among other personal details. Once you register with The Great Australian Survey and sign in to our services, you are not anonymous to us.

The Great Australian Survey uses information for two general purposes: to allow advertisers to market their products and services to you based upon your profile, and to analyse and provide analysis in aggregate form based on member profiles.

From time to time The Great Australian Survey will send personally identifiable information about you to other companies or people for marketing or research purposes.

  * We need to share your information in order to provide the product or service you have requested; 
  * We need to send the information to companies that work on behalf of The Great Australian Survey to provide a product or service to you. (Unless we tell you differently, these companies do not have any right to use the personally identifiable information we provide to them beyond what is necessary to assist us.); 
  * We respond to subpoenas, court orders or legal process; or
