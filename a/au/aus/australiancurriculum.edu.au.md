# Privacy Policy | ACARA

This privacy statement applies to your interactions with the website of the Australian Curriculum, Assessment and Reporting Authority ([www.acara.edu.au](http://www.acara.edu.au/)).

ACARA is subject to the Information Privacy Principles of the _[Privacy Act 1988](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/pa1988108/)_.  The IPPs set out how Australian Government agencies should collect, use, store and disclose personal information and how individuals can access records containing their personal information. 

ACARA is committed to protecting the privacy of personal information that it receives and collects from you.  ACARA seeks to comply with the Federal Privacy Commissioner's [Guidelines for Federal And ACT Government World Wide Websites](http://www.privacy.gov.au/materials/types/guidelines/view/6057).  The guidelines detail best practice for the handling of information in a secure, efficient and confidential manner.

## Personal information we collect

As a general rule, we do not collect personal information about you when you visit this site.  You can generally visit this site without telling us who you are, unless you choose to provide such information.

We collect personally identifiable information when a visitor emails us, completes a form asking to be added to our [email alert list ](https://web.archive.org/get_involved/subscribe.html)or registers for our [online consultation and feedback system](https://services.ncb.org.au/_layouts/ncb/NCBRegistration/NcbRegistration.aspx).  The personal information we hold may include:

  * your name and organisation
  * your email address
  * your postal address and contact phone numbers
  * information relating to your areas of interest
  * information relating to the role/capacity in which you provide feedback.  
 



## Use and disclosure of personal information

Any information we collect from you by email and forms will only be used for the purpose for which you have provided it.  Your details will not be added to a mailing list unless provided by you specifically for that purpose.  We will not disclose your personal information without your consent, unless required by law.

## Access to your personal information

ACARA will provide you with access to your personal information upon request and will allow you to update your personal information if incorrect.

## Handling of personal information

If you are concerned about the way that ACARA has handled your personal information, our Privacy Officer will investigate any concerns that you send to us in writing.

If you are dissatisfied with our investigation of your concerns, you can complain to the [Office of the Privacy Commissioner](http://www.privacy.gov.au/) who is independent of ACARA. The Privacy Commissioner has the power to investigate complaints about possible breaches of the [Privacy Act 1988](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/comlaw/Legislation/ActCompilation1.nsf/0/98DF083E9BFEA5CBCA2575C500021052?OpenDocument).

The Commissioner may then decide to investigate your complaint.

Note: [_Privacy Act 1988_](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/comlaw/Legislation/ActCompilation1.nsf/0/98DF083E9BFEA5CBCA2575C500021052?OpenDocument) states that you should address your complaint to ACARA in the first instance before lodging a complaint with the Privacy Commissioner.
