# Privacy - aussieBum online store

### PRIVACY

#### We are committed to your privacy!

aussieBum does collect a certain amount of information from our customers and visitors to our website. We do this for the effective running of our day-to-day business and in improving your experience with aussieBum. We know that keeping your personal information private is very important and we do this responsibly and in accordance with Australian law. Maintaining your confidence in us is our priority.

Please note: aussieBum.com is not directed at nor promoted to those under the age of 16, and no one under the age of 16 should register for any events promoted on aussieBum.com.

#### Collection: 

Providing personal information is not a prerequisite for accessing the aussiebum.com website. It is however necessary when placing an order online, registering to receive information or providing feedback. In these cases you will see that some of the information you are asked to provide is mandatory (without which you will not be able to complete the process) and some is voluntary.

Apart from the information you personally provide to us we may collect navigational information when you browse the aussiebum.com site. This is general information like your domain type, IP service provider, browser type and IP address and is presented in the form of overall average use on a daily basis and does not contain personal information about you. 

We also use a browser feature known as a cookie, which assigns a unique identification to your computer and are typically stored on your computer's hard drive. Both navigational information and cookies are used by us to identify problems, evaluate the effectiveness of our website and analyse trends. With this knowledge, we can improve the quality of your experience on our website by recognising and delivering more of the most desired features.

#### Storage and Security: 

aussieBum.com has implemented stringent security measures to protect the information we collect at our website. We receive and store the information on our secure databases which are only accessible as needed by authorised aussieBum staff who are fully aware of the importance of confidentiality. 

If you are visiting aussieBum.com from a location outside Australia, your connection will be through, and to, servers located in Australia. Your orders placed with aussieBum.com will be accepted and fully processed in, and shipped from, Australia unless otherwise notified. All information you provide will be processed and securely maintained in our web servers and internal systems located in Australia.

Furthermore, your personal information is not stored or remotely accessible on our website or on servers whose specific function is for the internet. In the event of a possible intrusion to our internet server you can be assured that your personal information and any data relating to yourself personally are not obtainable. The only data stored on our server are the general statistics.

Unfortunately, potential security and privacy issues are inherent in the nature of the internet and no data transmission over the internet can ever be absolutely guaranteed. We do undertake to provide the most secure shopping environment possible. We designed the aussieBum.com online store to accept orders only from web browsers that permit communication through Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology. This gives you the confidence of knowing that all orders placed are securely encrypted and protected and means you'll be unable to inadvertently place an order through an unsecured connection. aussieBum.com uses Thawte Secure Certificates - one of the most trusted certificates available on the internet today.

#### Use and Disclosure: 

aussieBum does not sell, rent or disclose your email address or other personal information to unrelated third parties unless required to do so by law, or based on our belief and in good faith, that it is necessary to protect the users of our website or the public.

We use the information gathered for processing your order, developing our website and for planning in improving our products and services to customers and visitors to the website. We may use the information you provide to inform you about new aussieBum products or items of interest via email or postal mail as long as you have indicated that you do not object to this. We try not to do this intrusively and you can always choose not to receive any further newsletters or promotional material from us by clicking on the appropriate link clearly visible in emails we send. Alternatively you can contact us directly at help@aussiebum.com.

When a visitor registers to join a mailing list, the information collected is used to communicate with that person directly and to help build a profile using the geographic location, age and any feedback the visitor may wish to provide. We welcome feedback and any comments made are used to improve our services and not for market research nor are stored with the customer's registration details as collective data.
