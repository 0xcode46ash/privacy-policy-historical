# Austrade’s Australian Privacy Principles Policy - Austrade

[](https://web.archive.org/Contact-us/default.aspx)[](https://web.archive.org/)[](https://web.archive.org/)

Austrade’s Australian Privacy Principles Policy

**Purpose**

  1. The Australian Privacy Principles ( **APPs** ) in the _Privacy Act 1988_ ( **Privacy Act** ) commenced on 12 March 2014.
  2. The Australian Trade Commission ( **Austrade** ) is bound by the APPs.
  3. This is Austrade’s APP privacy policy as required by APP 1.3 in the Privacy Act. This policy sets out:
    1. the kinds of personal information that Austrade collects and holds;
    2. how Austrade collects and holds personal information;
    3. the purposes for which Austrade collects, holds, uses and discloses personal information;
    4. how an individual may access personal information about the individual that is held by Austrade and seek the correction of such information;
    5. how an individual may complain about a breach of the APPs, and how Austrade will deal with such a complaint;
    6. whether Austrade is likely to disclose personal information to overseas recipients; and
    7. if Austrade is likely to disclose personal information to overseas recipients—the countries in which such recipients are likely to be located if it is practicable to specify those countries in the policy.
  4. The purpose of this APP privacy policy is:
    1. to provide guidance to Austrade’s staff, secondees and contractors and locally employed officers around the world where Austrade operates on the APPs, specifically on the collection, storage and use of personal information;
    2. to communicate to the public an understanding of the type of personal information that Austrade collects and holds; and
    3. to enhance openness and transparency of Austrade’s operations in relation to managing personal information.

**Personal information**

  5. On 12 March 2014, the definition of 'personal information' in the Privacy Act was expanded.The new definition is:

information or an opinion about an identified individual, or an individual who is reasonably identifiable:

(a)           whether the information or opinion is true or not; and

(b)           whether the information or opinion is recorded in a material form or not.

  6. Before 12 March 2014, personal information had been defined in terms of information (including an opinion) about an individual whose identity was apparent, or could reasonably be ascertained, from the information.Now, there is no need for an individual’s identity to be reasonably gleaned from the information.It can be gleaned from any source.
  7. “Sensitive information” as defined in the Privacy Act is a category of personal information.Sensitive information includes information about an individual’s racial origin, membership of a trade association, criminal record or health information.
  8. Corporate information is not personal information.Austrade regularly deals in corporate information, and also deals in personal information.It is possible that Austrade will deal in sensitive information.This APP privacy policy addresses personal information, including sensitive information.

**Austrade’s functions**

  9. Austrade mainly collects personal information in the course of carrying out Austrade’s functions in the _Australian Trade Commission Act 1985_ ( **ATC Act** ).[1]Austrade:
    1. will only collect personal information that is reasonably necessary for, or directly related to, one or more of its functions in the ATC Act, and related activities; and
    2. will not collect sensitive information about an individual unless the individual consents to the collection, and the information is reasonably necessary for, or directly related to, one or more of its functions in the ATC Act, and related activities.
  10. Austrade’s functions are in the ATC Act, and in other legislation that will be broadly canvassed in this policy.
  11. Austrade is the Australian Government’s agency for promoting trade, investment and international education. Through a global network of offices, Austrade assists Australian enterprises to develop international business, helps win foreign direct investment into Australia, and promotes Australia’s international education and training sector. Austrade’s services and activities are directed to improving productivity, creating jobs and contributing to the wellbeing of the Australian community.
  12. Specifically, Austrade helps Australian businesses reduce the time, cost and risk of exporting through valued services, including through the administration of the Export Market Development Grants ( **EMDG** ) scheme and the TradeStart program. Austrade works closely with state and territory governments to attract and facilitate productive foreign direct investment into Australia. Austrade has responsibility for promoting the Australian international education and training sector in overseas markets and assists Australian education providers with market information and services.
  13. Austrade provides advice to the Australian Government on its trade, investment, and international education policy agenda and delivers Australian consular, passport and other government services in specific overseas locations.Austrade also works on a range of tourism policy, projects, programs and research to strengthen Australia's tourism industry and to grow Australia's tourism market share in a volatile and competitive global environment.
  14. At 30 June 2013, Austrade operated in 82 offices in 48 markets. Austrade delivered consular, passport and other government services in 172 consular posts, which it manages.Within Australia, Austrade’s services and programs were delivered through 12 Austrade locations and through a network of 31 TradeStart advisers in metropolitan and regional areas.[2]
  15. Two key deliverables of Austrade in 2013/2014 are:
    1. to advance Australia’s trade, investment and education promotion interests through information, advice and services to business, the education sector and governments; and
    2. the protection and welfare of Australians abroad through timely and responsive consular and passport services in specific locations overseas.
  16. Austrade administers the EMDG scheme in the _Export Market Development Grants Act 1997_ ( **EMDG Act** )[3]The EMDG scheme encourages small and medium-sized Australian businesses to enter into and develop export markets. To be eligible for a grant, applicants must incur more than $20,000 in eligible expenses, which businesses accessing the scheme for the first time may incur over two years. The scheme then reimburses up to 50 per cent of the eligible expenses minus $10,000.
  17. Recipients under the EMDG scheme are predominately corporations, but individuals comprise a significant proportion of recipients.Even when a corporation has applied for a grant under the EMDG Act, personal information may be dealt with in as part of the assessment process of the application.
  18. Apart from collecting personal information in the course of carrying out its statutory functions, Austrade may also collect personal information as part of Austrade’s roles as an Australian Government agency, and as an employer (under the _Public Service Act 1999_ ) and a contractor.Individuals, other than Austrade staff,[4] have the option of not identifying themselves, or of using a pseudonym with dealing with Austrade, unless the circumstances dictate otherwise.

**Collection principles**

  19. Austrade will:
    1. only collect personal information by lawful and fair means; and 
    2. will take such steps (if any) as are reasonable in the circumstances to ensure that the personal information that Austrade collects is accurate, up-to-date and complete.
  20. Further, Austrade will only collect personal information about an individual from the individual unless:
    1. the individual consents to the collection of the information from someone other than the individual; or
    2. Austrade is required or authorised by or under an Australian law (which includes the law of a State or Territory), or a court/tribunal order, to collect the information from someone other than the individual; or
    3. it is unreasonable or impracticable to do so.
  21. The two general principles above apply to the collection of solicited personal information.If Austrade receives personal information but did not solicit the information, Austrade will deal with the unsolicited personal information in accordance with APP 4.
  22. Once Austrade has collected personal information, Austrade will notify the individual concerned in accordance with APP 5.

**Holding personal information**

  23. Generally, Austrade takes such steps as are reasonable in the circumstances to protect the personal information that it holds:
  24. Austrade has developed specific protective security policies and procedures that meet its business needs. The information security policies and procedures for personal information complement and support Austrade’s operational procedures.

**Austrade Security Management Structure**

  25. To ensure that effective information security arrangements are fully integrated into the Austrade culture, practices and operational plans, the CEO has designated specific security responsibilities throughout the agency. **The following diagram** provides an overview of the Austrade’s security management structure.

 

  26. The Chief Executive Officer (CEO) in the diagram is the Agency Head who is accountable to the responsible Minister for information security within Austrade. The CEO must ensure that security is part of Austrade's culture, and Austrade has effective security programs that ensure Austrade's capacity to function, public confidence in the Government and Austrade, and the safeguarding of official resources and information held in trust.
  27. The Security Advisory Group (SAG) in the diagram is a senior executive management committee chaired by the Executive Director, Education and Corporate Operations, responsible to the CEO for advice and guidance on the management of security issues within Austrade, including on issues relating to security policy, planning and risk management. The SAG provides a formal mechanism for considering specific security issues emerging from, and identified by, overseas posts and business units in Australia. 
  28. The Austrade Security Executive in the diagram is responsible for coordinating communication between security and business functions as well as overseeing the application of controls and the security risk management processes. The Security Executive is responsible for informing the CEO and the SAG of issues impacting upon the effectiveness the security program.
  29. The Chief Information Officer (CIO) in the diagram is responsible for the implementation of Information and Communication Technology system maintenance, development, protection and preservation practices to ensure ongoing confidentiality, integrity and availability of Austrade's information, including personal information.
  30. The Chief Information Security Officer CISO in the diagram sets the strategic direction for Austrade's information and communications technology (ICT) security program. The CISO ensures that the ICT security program aligns with Austrade's business objectives and complies with the provisions of the Australian Government's Information Security Manual (the ISM is discussed below) and the PSPF.
  31. The Agency Security Adviser (ASA) in the diagram is the principal adviser on security risk management for Austrade and responsible for the provision of strategic and operational security advice to Austrade management - including the identification of security risks and potential threats to the Austrade business environment, and proposed mitigations. The ASA is responsible for the development and implementation of the Austrade Security Plan and related protective security measures. Austrade will ensure that the ASA has detailed knowledge of agency-specific protective security policy, protocols and mandatory protective security requirements in order to fulfil their protective security responsibilities.
  32. The Information Technology Security Adviser (ITSA) in the diagram is responsible for leadership and management of information technology security (IT Security) within Austrade. The ITSA establishes, manages and administers Austrade's ICT security policy, procedures and measures to ensure preventive and recovery strategies are in place, and to minimise the risk of unauthorised access by internal and external security threats. Austrade will ensure that the ITSA has detailed knowledge of agency-specific protective security policy, protocols and mandatory protective security requirements in order to fulfil their protective security responsibilities.
  33. Senior Officers at each Austrade location are responsible for ensuring the security and protection of Austrade personnel, information and other assets at their location. 
  34. Austrade supervisors at all levels are responsible for ensuring the security and protection of Austrade’s information and other assets in their area. The supervisor must monitor employee behaviour and report to the ASA any concerns about an employee's suitability for access to security classified resources and to Australian Government resources in general. Supervisors must ensure that all employees whom they supervise undertake and maintain relevant security training commitments.
  35. Facility Security Officer FSO/ Post Security Officer PSOs are Austrade officers nominated by management for their respective Austrade office or Austrade-managed consulate. They are responsible to the State Director or head of post for the day-to-day implementation of Austrade's protective security policies and procedures. The role of FSO/PSO is to improve the overall level of responsiveness and capacity of Austrade to meet emerging security threats and risks.

**Austrade Security Policy**

  36. The Austrade Security Policy is based on the PSPF and the Australian Government's Information Security Manual ( **ISM** ). The ISM:
    1. is produced by the Australian Signals Directorate;[7]
    2. is the standard which governs the security of government information and communications technology ( **ICT** ) systems
    3. complements the PSPF.
  37. The Austrade Security Policy (which is not for public dissemination) translates the mandatory requirements of the PSPF and the ISM into security objectives and principles for the management of security within Austrade. It reflects the intent of the CEO to protect appropriately Austrade information, and other assets.
  38. Austrade employees are responsible for complying with the Austrade Security Policy, supporting policies, procedures and instructions. Employees are responsible for maintaining their suitability to access Australian Government resources and, where required, hold a national security clearance.
  39. The Austrade Information Security Policy sets out the requirements of the information security principles provided in the overarching Austrade Security Policy, specifying objectives for the protection of Austrade's information assets. This includes information generally, personal information, and ICT and non-technical areas of information security.
  40. The Austrade Information Security Policy:
    1. adopts a risk management approach,[8]
    2. takes reasonably practicable steps to ensure that key business and support processes incorporate effective information security control;
    3. relies on adequate operating procedures and resources for the management of Austrade’s ICT systems.

**Recent ICT developments**

  41. In 2012–2013, Austrade continued its strong focus on monitoring and managing the ever-increasing volume and sophistication of cybersecurity threats, such as attempts to gain unauthorised access to Austrade’s information and systems.
  42. In addition to the introduction of further security enhancements and mitigations, including improved monitoring processes and two-factor authentication to Austrade’s Virtual Private Network, Austrade has implemented a new system to help manage protected-level information. The new system has been subject to independent assessment and has received formal certification and accreditation. During 2012–2013, access to the system was provided to selected onshore staff, with plans in 2013–2014 to extend access to Australia-based staff in some offshore locations.

**Secrecy and personal information**

  43. A cornerstone of Austrade’s information security is the secrecy provision in the ATC Act.[9]According to that provision, Austrade staff (among others) must not, either directly or indirectly, except for the purposes of the ATC Act:
    1. make a record of, or divulge or communicate to any person, any information concerning the affairs of another person acquired by the Austrade staff member by reason of his or her employment; or
    2. produce to any person a document relating to the affairs of another person furnished for the purposes of the ATC Act
  44. This provision applies to information collected when administering the EMDG Act, except for:
    1. the name and address of a person to whom Austrade has authorised a payment;
    2. the amount of a grant to a person; and
    3. the industry to which a grant relates
  45. The secrecy provision extends to information in a subpoena issued by a court.

**Other relevant legislation**

  46. Under the _Archives Act 1983_ , it is illegal for Austrade to destroy Australian Government records (which may contain personal information) except in the specified and controlled circumstances, such as permission from the National Archives of Australia.
  47. Under the _Crimes Act 1914_ , Austrade staff (and anyone working for Austrade, including contractors and consultants) are prohibited from publishing or communicating facts, documents or information which they gain access to through their work unless they have permission to do so.
  48. Under the _Freedom of Information Act 1982_ , there is a presumption that Austrade will make official information available to anyone who makes an FOI application, except where the disclosure would contravene the secrecy provision in the ATC Act, or disclosure be detrimental to the protection of essential public interests or the private and business affairs of people about whom the information was collected, especially personal information.
  49. Under the _Public Service Act 1999_ , the Australian Public Service (APS) Code of Conduct provides that an APS employee in Austrade must not give or disclose, directly or indirectly, any information about public business or anything of which the employee has official knowledge, except in the course of his or her duties as an APS employee or with the CEO’s express authority.

**Use and disclosure of personal information**

  50. Personal information held by Austrade about an individual that was collected for a particular purpose (the **_primary purpose_** ), will not be used or disclosed by Austrade for another purpose (the **_secondary purpose_** ) unless:
    1. the individual has consented to the use or disclosure of the information; or
    2. the principles in AAPs 6 or 8 apply in relation to the use or disclosure of the information.
  51. In particular, Austrade may use or disclose personal information about an individual if:
    1. The individual would reasonably expect Austrade to use or disclose the information for the secondary purpose and the secondary purpose is:

(i)         if the personal information is sensitive information – directly related to the primary purpose; or

(ii)        if the information is not sensitive information – related to the primary purpose; or

    2. the use or disclosure of the information is required or authorised by or under an Australian law or a court/tribunal order; or
    3. a “permitted general situation” exists in relation to the use or disclosure of the information by Austrade.[10]
  52. For example, if Austrade has collected personal information about an individual for the purpose of administering the EMDG scheme, Austrade will normally use or disclose that information under the EMDG Act, the regulations made under the EMDG Act, and the suite of legislative instruments made under the EMDG Act, without seeking the individual’s consent.
  53. If:

(a)        Austrade holds personal information about an individual; 

(b)        Austrade no longer needs the information for any purpose for which the information may be used or disclosed by Austrade under the APPs; 

(c)        the information is not contained in a Commonwealth record (as defined in the _Archives Act 1983_ ); and

(d)        Austrade is not required by or under an Australian law, or a court/tribunal order, to retain the information;

Austrade will take such steps as are reasonable in the circumstances to destroy the information or to ensure that the information is de-identified.

  54. Austrade will take such steps (if any) as are reasonable in the circumstances to ensure that the personal information that it uses or discloses is, having regard to the purpose of the use or disclosure, accurate, up-to-date, complete and relevant.

**Staff, secondees and contractors**

  55. Austrade collects and uses personal and sensitive information about its staff, secondees and contractors (and applicants for those positions) for personnel, security and related purposes where it is authorised by Commonwealth laws including:
  56. Austrade’s human resources policies provide detailed information about the kind of personal information collected, and the purposes for which it is used and disclosed.Personal information of Austrade’s staff, secondees and contractors is disclosed to Commonwealth agencies, law enforcement agencies, health providers and advisors, and other persons authorised by Commonwealth, State or Territory law to receive it. It is also disclosed to other entities to whom a person gives Austrade consent to disclose their personal information.

**Access to personal information**

  57. Austrade will, subject to the exceptions in APP 12, give you access to your personal information held by Austrade, on request by you.
  58. A principal exception in APP 12 is if Austrade is required or authorised to refuse to give access by or under the _Freedom of Information Act 1982_.
  59. Austrade will 
    1. respond to your request for access within 30 days after the request is made, in accordance with the principles in APP 12 (which might include refusing access)
    2. give access to the information in the manner requested by you, if it is reasonable and practicable to do so.
  60. Austrade aims to ensure that the personal information it holds is accurate, up-to-date and complete.You should ensure that the personal information you provide is accurate (true and correct), up-to-date and complete, and notify Austrade if you believe that the information is outdated, inaccurate or incomplete.
  61. Requests for correction of personal information can be made by contacting the FOI Coordinator (as per the complaints process below).

How to make a complaint

  62. Complaints about breaches of the APPs by Austrade:
    1. must be in writing (which can be an email), unless exceptional circumstances exist for the complaint to be verbal;
    2. must state that the complaint is about a breach by Austrade; 
    3. provide information about the breach to assist us to process your complaint; and 
    4. provide an address for reply. 
  63. You can send your complaint:

**By post:**

FOI Contact Officer  
Business Effectiveness  
Austrade  
GPO Box 2386  
CANBERRA ACT 2601

**By email:** [foi.coordination.officer@austrade.gov.au](mailto:foi.coordination.officer@austrade.gov.au)

  64. Generally, Austrade will only accept complaints from or on behalf of a person who believes an act or practice of Austrade has interfered with their privacy and may have breached an APP.
  65. A complaint should identify whether it is about:
    1. the collection of personal information;
    2. the use of personal information;
    3. the disclosure of personal information;
    4. the security or storage of personal information;
    5. the accuracy of personal information;
    6. a refusal to give access to their personal information; and
    7. a refusal to change or delete personal information.
  66. Austrade’s FOI Coordinator normally deals with privacy complaints. Otherwise, if the complaint is about the FOI Coordinator, the complaint will be dealt with by someone who was not involved in the conduct that is complained about. Austrade will attempt to confirm (as appropriate and necessary) with the person making the complaint:
    1. their understanding of the conduct relevant to the complaint;
    2. their understanding of the APPs relevant to the conduct complained of; and
    3. what they expect as an outcome.
  67. Austrade will inform the person making the complaint:
    1. whether Austrade will conduct an investigation;
    2. the name, title, and details of a contact person; and
    3. the estimated completion date for the investigation process.
  68. Austrade’s investigation of a complaint will normally look at matters including:
    1. Did the alleged conduct occur?
    2. Why did Austrade collect the information?
    3. Was the information stored by Austrade in a ‘record’ (as defined in the Privacy Act) or a generally available publication?
    4. Did Austrade comply with the relevant APPs or the requirements of the Privacy Act when dealing with the information?
  69. After Austrade has completed its enquiries, Austrade will contact the person who has made the complaint, usually in writing, to advise the outcome and invite the person to consider if they wish to make a response to Austrade’s conclusions about the complaint.
  70. If a response is received, Austrade will assess it and advise if Austrade has changed its view.
  71. If the person making the complaint is not satisfied with the outcome, Austrade will advise further options including, if appropriate, the ability for the person to seek a review of Austrade’s response by the Privacy Commissioner within the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner.

**Disclosure of personal information overseas**

  72. Austrade is generally likely to disclose personal information to overseas recipients in the course of carrying out its functions under the ATC Act.However, you are reasonably likely to know in advance that your personal information will be disclosed overseas.
  73. Austrade will not disclose personal information about an individual overseas except:
    1. where it is in accordance with the law;
    2. where it is in accordance with the individual’s consent; or
    3. where it is in accordance with a memorandum of understanding or agreement between Austrade and the overseas recipient and the memorandum is required or authorised by or under an Australian law.
  74. Before Austrade discloses personal information about an individual to an overseas recipient, Austrade will take such steps as are reasonable in the circumstances to ensure that the overseas recipient does not breach the APPs (other than APP 1) in relation to the information, subject to the exceptions in APP 8.
  75. It is not reasonably practical to identify the countries in which overseas recipients are likely to be located, in this policy.Generally, the countries in which Austrade normally carries out its operations are identified in Austrade’s most recent Annual Report on its website.[11]

**Other information**

  76. When accessing Austrade’s website, its servers make a record of the visit and log the following information for statistical purposes:

    2. the date and time of visit to the site;
    3. the pages accessed and documents downloaded;
    4. the previous site/s visited; and
    5. the search terms entered.
  77. No attempt will be made to identify users or their browsing activities except, in the unlikely event of an investigation, where a law enforcement agency may exercise a warrant to inspect the Internet Service Provider’s logs.
