# AustralianSuper - Privacy Policy

## AustralianSuper respects your privacy

### 1\. Introduction

The following is information about AustralianSuper’s Privacy Policy and the way in which AustralianSuper has implemented the requirements of the Privacy Act 1988.

Protecting your personal information is important to us, and is required by law. The Commonwealth Privacy Act determines that we must handle your personal information in accordance with a set of Australian Privacy Principles.

You can read AustralianSuper's [Privacy Collection Statement](https://web.archive.org/privacy-collection-statement.aspx) here.

### 2. What personal information is collected and held by AustralianSuper?

We collect the following kinds of personal information: your name, address, email address, phone number, date of birth, your Tax File Number (TFN), the names of your beneficiaries and employment details including salary information.

In some situations we may collect information about your health, including medical information.

### 3. How does AustralianSuper collect and hold personal information?

Personal information is generally collected directly from you or through your employer, adviser, previous superannuation fund, or other representative authorised by you.

Health information is collected from you or your employer, adviser, other insurer, or other representative authorised by you and is provided to us or to our insurers.  If required, we obtain independent medical reports directly from your medical practitioner(s).

For employment candidates, AustralianSuper collects your personal information including employment history and other information during the recruitment process either directly from you or from recruiters. 

Personal information including health information is held and stored by us and/or our administrator.  Our insurers will also hold and store personal and health information in accordance with their own privacy policy.

Once your details have been recorded by our administrator, your original application is securely stored based on the following application method:

  * Paper applications are held at our administrator’s document storage facility on our behalf
  * Online applications are stored within our secure electronic network.



Within AustralianSuper and our administrator, access to your information is restricted to staff who require the information to administer your account and provide information and services to you. A system of passwords and different levels of access is used to protect the information held on the system.

### 4. What are the purposes for which AustralianSuper collects, holds, uses and discloses personal information?

The personal information we collect will be used by AustralianSuper and its staff to:

  * Open and administer your super account, and keep you informed about your super and insurance and opportunities available to you as a Fund member
  * Ensure you’re eligible for products and services (including insurance)
  * Help you combine your super accounts and check if you have lost super (when you ask us to); and
  * Undertake market research, member data analysis and direct marketing activities.



For employment candidates, AustralianSuper collects your personal information for recruitment purposes, to manage your employment application and, if you are successfully placed in a position at AustralianSuper, your ongoing employment. 

If AustralianSuper can’t collect your personal information from you it will be difficult to perform the activities listed above.

If you submit incomplete or inaccurate information to our insurers, they may not be able to provide you with the insurance cover you are seeking, or complete their assessment of your insurance-related matters.

### 5. Why does AustralianSuper ask you to nominate your dependants for death benefits?

You are asked to advise AustralianSuper of the names of the persons who you would like to receive your superannuation in the event of your death. This information assists us to distribute your death benefit fairly to your dependants or to your estate.

We will take your wishes into account, but will also look at all your dependants at the date of your death. Advising us about your relationship with the persons you nominate is not required if you consider this to be an unreasonably intrusive request.

We recommend that you provide any beneficiaries you nominate to us with a copy of AustralianSuper’s Privacy Collection Statement and Privacy Policy and tell them that you have provided AustralianSuper with their name and address details. These details will only be used to manage payment of your super in the event of your death.

### 6. To whom does AustralianSuper disclose personal information?

We will share your personal information with these service providers:

  * Our Fund administrator, Superpartners Pty Ltd, to open and administer your super and insurance account and report required information to the Australian Taxation Office for tax related purposes.  Superpartners Pty Ltd may also collect personal information on our behalf directly from you, for example, if you call our contact centre or send us queries, or if further information is required from you to open and administer your account
  * Our insurers so they can assess your eligibility for insurance and look after any insurance claims (see further information below about insurance claims)
  * Mail houses to send you information about your account via mail, SMS and email
  * Independent consultants and market research companies to conduct member data analysis and run member research via phone, mail, SMS or email
  * Auditors and lawyers for accounting, auditing and legal requirements
  * Our Online Identification Verification Services provider - where you provide your personal details for the purpose of online data verification, our third party service provider will use your details for this purpose.  Your information will be subject to an information match request in relation to relevant official record holder information and a corresponding information match result will be provided via the use of third party systems.

In the event that you claim an insurance benefit for either Total and Permanent Disablement or Income Protection (Temporary Disablement):

  * The relevant insurer may collect personal information from or about you and may provide your personal information to AustralianSuper and our fund administrator, to assist with the assessment and administration of the insurance claim
  * The insurers may also pass information to claims investigators, medical practitioners, reinsurers, insurance reference bureaus and certain organisations to whom they outsource some functions.  This will be set out in the relevant insurer’s privacy statement.



If your insurance claim is declined and you take legal action or complain to an external dispute resolution body:

  * AustralianSuper and our service providers must, on request, provide your personal details and information about your health to legal representatives of AustralianSuper and the insurer, officers of the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal, the Financial Ombudsman Service and Court officials.
