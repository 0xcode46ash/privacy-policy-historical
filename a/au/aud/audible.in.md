# Privacy : Language Tutors

**Please take time to read how we respect your privacy.**

Information Collection on this web site is strictly for ensuring proper operation of the site itself. We will not sell, share, or rent this information to others in any way. We have reduced to the minimum possible, instances in which personal information is collected from users. 

One such occasion where we need identification information from our users is at registration. In order to utilize some of our web site features, users must first complete a registration form. During registration, the user is required to give certain contact information (such as an e-mail address). Many fields on our registration form are optional (like adding a picture to a Tutor's profile page), but many users will find that being as comprehensive as possible has its advantages. However, there is absolutely no obligation to fill out more than the required fields. 

From time to time, we conduct online surveys to identify areas where we are doing well and those in which we need to improve. Collecting such feedback information from our users is critical in ensuring the best possible performance. Participating in our surveys is optional but always appreciate your help. 

We do not use pop-ups, nor do we send unsolicited mail, also known as "spam". All communications to users, such as a newsletter, will be on an "opt-in" basis, meaning that the user must have given prior consent to receive such email newsletter or other communications. 

Cookies are used on the site for very specific purposes. A cookie is a piece of data, which is located on a visitor's computer during the time he/she is on the web site. Cookies contain information about the user. Almost every membership site uses cookies. Your online bank uses them. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while you are browsing our web site. Once a user closes the browser, the cookie simply terminates. Cookies will not terminate if a user opts to save the cookie, by checking on boxes such as "Keep me logged in until I choose to log out". 

Some of our sponsors might use cookies on our site to track so called "leads" coming from us to them. However, we have no access to or control over these cookies. 

We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track user movements, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information. 

This web site contains links to other sites. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of these sites. We encourage you to read the privacy statements of web site that collects personally identifiable information. 

Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information on line - for example, through e-mail, discussion lists, or elsewhere - that information can be collected and used by others. In short, if you post personal information online that is accessible to the public, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties. 

Ultimately, you are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your personal information and the personal information of people dependent on you. Please be careful and responsible whenever you are online. 

By using our web sites, you consent to the collection and use of information by languagetutors.org as specified above. If we make any changes to our privacy policy, we will post those changes on this page, so that you are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances we disclose it.
