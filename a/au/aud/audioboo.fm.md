You may decline to submit personally identifiable information, in which case we may not be able to provide certain services to you. The type of information collected during the registration process may include your contact information, such as your name, e-mail address, postal address, phone number and country of residence (“Registration Information”).

Any personal information or other content that you voluntarily disclose online (for example, on your public profile, in posts, comments, or notes) becomes publicly available and could be collected and used by others. Your account User Name is displayed to other users when you post, send direct messages, or comment. Any post made in public mode or comment that you submit to the Site may be redistributed through the Internet and other media, and could be viewed by the general public.  
We do not use your email address, phone number, or other personally identifiable information to send commercial or marketing messages without your consent or except as part of a specific program or feature for which you will have the ability to opt-in or opt-out. We may, however, use your email address without further consent for non-marketing or administrative purposes (such as notifying you of major Site changes or for customer service purposes).  
We use certain non-personally-identifiable information (such as anonymous usage data, cookies, IP addresses, browser type, clickstream data, and user location) to improve the quality and design of the Site and to create new features, promotions, functionality, and services by storing, tracking, and analyzing user preferences and trends.

### Invitations and Other Communications to Non-members

Registered users can invite friends to become registered users by sending invitation emails via our automated invitation system. We store the email addresses that registered users provide so that we may keep track of how many people are being invited. We do not sell these email addresses or use them to send any other communication besides the invitations. Recipients of invitations may contact us to request the removal of their information from our database.
