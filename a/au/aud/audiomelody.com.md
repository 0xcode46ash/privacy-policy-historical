## Privacy

User privacy is of paramount importance to AudioMelody. The success of our business depends upon our ability to maintain the trust of our users. Below is information regarding AudioMelody’s commitment to protect the privacy of users and ensure the integrity of the Internet.

### Information collected in advertisement delivery

In the course of delivering an ad to you, AudioMelody does not collect any personally identifiable information about you, such as your name, address, phone number or email address. We, however, use a number of different adserving solutions including Valueclick, Burst Media, Casale Media and OpenX to collect non-personally identifiable information about you, such as the server your computer is logged onto, your browser type (for example, Netscape or Explorer), and whether you responded to the ad delivered. The non-personally identifiable information collected by AudioMelody is for the purpose of targeting ads and measuring ad effectiveness on behalf of AudioMelody’s advertisers and Web publishers.

These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements on this site and other sites about goods and services that may be of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, please visit any of the network sites or the Network Advertising Initiative
