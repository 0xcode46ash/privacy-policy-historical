"Cookies" are small items of data that some websites either write to your hard drive upon your visit to their site(s) or store in the browser. These data files contain information the site can use to organize the pages you have visited on a particular website. Some of our websites may use "cookie" technology to measure site activity and tailor information to fit your personal interests. In this way, we can deliver tailor-made information suiting your personal interests upon your next visit to our site(s). Our use of "cookie" technology is, thus, to provide you with a more individualized delivery of information and an optimal viewing experience.

Pixel Tags
    

We may use "pixel tags", which are small graphic files that allow us to monitor the use of our websites. A pixel tag can collect information such as the IP (Internet Protocol) address of the computer that downloaded the page on which the tag appears; the URL (Uniform Resource Locator) of the page on which the pixel tag appears; the time the page containing the pixel tag was viewed;the type of browser that fetched the pixel tag; and the identification number of any cookie (please see A word on "Cookies") on the computer previously placed by that server.

Our e-commerce site uses Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption technology supported by Microsoft Internet Explorer, Netscape Navigator/Communicator, and other popular browsers to protect your online transactions. SSL encrypts your credit card number, name, address, and phone number before they travel over the Internet. We also use additional technologies and measures to prevent unauthorized access or disclosure, maintain data accuracy, and ensure appropriate use of this information.
