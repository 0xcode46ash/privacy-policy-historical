If it is reasonable and practicable to do so, Autobarn will collect personal information only from you.

Autobarn will not collect sensitive information about you unless you have consented to that collection or the collection is required by law.

Where you choose not to provide requested information, Autobarn will advise you of what impact that non-disclosure may have.
