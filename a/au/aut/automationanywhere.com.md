# Privacy

### Our privacy policy is simple - we do not sell your personal information to anyone at any time, ever!

If You Order

Our site uses an order form for customers to order our products. We collect contact information (like email addresses), and financial information (like account or credit card numbers). Contact information from the order form is used to ship orders. **Automation Anywhere** does not sell or use your private information (name, address, email address, etc.) for any purpose other than to ship you your order or to contact you or if there is a product update available or if there is a problem with your order. You will receive a confirmation email immediately after you order. In a second email you will receive the activation key.

If you ordered a product bundle that includes our partner products, we will share your information with our partners in order for them to fulfill the order.

#### Web Site

We use IP addresses, web server logs, and cookie data to analyze trends, administer the site, track page popularity, and gather information for aggregate use. We will not attempt to identify individual users through their IP addresses or cookie data.
