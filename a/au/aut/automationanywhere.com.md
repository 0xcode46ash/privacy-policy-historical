# Privacy

### Our privacy policy is simple - we do not sell your personal information to anyone at any time, ever!

If You Order

Our site uses an order form for customers to order our products. We collect contact information (like email addresses), and financial information (like account or credit card numbers). Contact information from the order form is used to ship orders. **Automation Anywhere** does not sell or use your private information (name, address, email address, etc.) for any purpose other than to ship you your order or to contact you or if there is a product update available or if there is a problem with your order. You will receive a confirmation email immediately after you order. In a second email you will receive the activation key.

If you ordered a product bundle that includes our partner products, we will share your information with our partners in order for them to fulfill the order.

#### Web Site

We use IP addresses, web server logs, and cookie data to analyze trends, administer the site, track page popularity, and gather information for aggregate use. We will not attempt to identify individual users through their IP addresses or cookie data.

#### Contacting the Web Site

If you have any questions about this privacy statement, the practices of this site, or your dealings with this web site, you can email: [contact@automationanywhere.com](maito:contact@automationanywhere.com)

#### Unsubscribe.

If you are currently a registered user of Automation Anywhere and do not want to receive any further communication from Automation Anywhere, please email us with subject line 'Unsubscribe' at [newsletter@automationanywhere.com](mailto:newsletter@automationanywhere.com)

#### E-mail and Anti-Spam Policy

Automation Anywhere only sends emails to customers and prospects that have directly consented (opted-in) to receive email. Automation Anywhere forbids the transmission of unsolicited commercial email (spam). Automation Anywhere does not buy or sell email lists, nor do we allow our employees to use purchased or harvested email lists.

In addition, Automation Anywhere offers confirmed opt-in as a tool for our clients to use to help minimize allegations of spam and abuse. When a list is designated as "confirmed opt-in" Automation Anywhere automatically sends a follow-up email to each subscriber on such lists asking the recipient to verify that they wish to receive communications via email. Only those subscribers responding affirmatively will be opted-in to future mailings sent from Automation Anywhere and any of its associated domains.
