# Automobile Magazine Privacy Policy

  
  
**AutomobileMag.com Privacy Policy**

Your Privacy on the Internet is of the utmost importance to us. Because we gather certain types of information about the users of Automobilemag.com, we feel you should fully understand the terms and conditions surrounding the capture and use of the information. This privacy statement discloses what information we gather, how we use it, and how to correct or change it. 

**Gathering Information:**  
Automobilemag.com gathers two types of information about users: data that users provide through optional, voluntary registration of the Automobilemag.com Website and through optional, voluntary participation in message boards, chats and surveys as well as certain contests and sweepstakes. This information enables Automobilemag.com to better tailor our content and classified services to our visitors' and advertisers' needs. 

**Use of the Information:**  
Automobilemag.com may perform statistical analyses of user behavior in order to measure relative consumer interest on various services (for product development purposes) and to inform advertisers as to how many consumers have responded to a classified listing and seen or "clicked" their advertising banner. In performance of these statistical analyses, we will disclose information to third parties only in aggregate form. Personal information on individual subscribers and advertisers will not be provided to any third party. 

Automobilemag.com may send out emails to users that have opted in for an online service to announce special offers, services and announcements from our site and/or advertisers. 

**Sharing of the Information:**  
Automobilemag.com shares the information it tracks, in aggregate form, with advertisers and other partners. We do not release personal information about any individual subscriber to third parties. 

Automobilemag.com occasionally makes the list of postal addresses volunteered on its Web site via email registration, contest, sweepstakes and surveys available to other carefully screened associations or companies whose products or services we think you may find of interest. We pre-screen all use of our information for our customers. 

**Other Privacy Issues & Concerns**  
Automobilemag.com is not responsible for the content or privacy policies of Web sites to which it may link. Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information online - for example on message boards, through email or in chat areas- that information can be collected and used by others. In short, if you post personal information online that is accessible to the public, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return. Furthermore, while we strive to protect your personal information, Automobilemag.com cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk! You are solely responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your password and/or any account information. Please be careful and responsible whenever you're online.
