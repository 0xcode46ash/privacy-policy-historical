**About Cookies**  
The Auto Europe web site does make limited use of cookies to better serve you. However, we do not store any personal or credit card information about you in these cookies. They do contain a session id number and some other basic information about your visit (for instance, which country you chose when you came to the site).

If you prefer, you can delete your Auto Europe cookies with our privacy tools listed on the right.

**Secure Transactions**  
All requests and credit card confirmations sent to us from our web site go through our secure server to protect your information. To verify that your browser is using the secure server, look for a small padlock icon on the lower part of your browser window. If it is shown in the "locked" position, your transaction is secure. (Please note, the security features are only turned on for pages where you can view and submit your request or confirm your quote by providing your credit card number.)

**Email Newsletter**  
We use an "opt-in" email newsletter. This means you will be sent a confirmation email when your address is submitted to us. If you do not respond to this message, we will not send you any more email.

Otherwise you should not receive any unsolicited email from us. In addition, we may selectively provide certain information to other companies or organizations that have products or services we think may interest you. If you do not want to receive promotional materials regarding third party products or services, and you indicate this preference when you provide your personal information to us, we will honor your preference by not providing your information to such third parties. If you have chosen to allow us to provide your information to others, you may use the privacy tools on the right to [opt-out](https://www.autoeurope.com/opt_out.cfm) at anytime.
