Autotrader.ie allows users to search advertisements posted on Autotrader.ie for new and used cars, motorbikes, and commercial, farm, plant and leisure vehicles for sale. Autotrader.ie also allows users, both private sellers and professional trade advertisers to register with Autotrader.ie (" **Advertisers** "), and to place advertisements for the sale of Vehicles.

1.2 This policy, together with our [Terms and Conditions](https://web.archive.org/terms-and-conditions) and any other documents referred to in them, set out the basis on which any personal data we collect from you, or that you provide to us, will be processed by us. Please read the following carefully to understand our views and practices regarding your personal data and how we will treat it.

* **2 HOW WE COLLECT INFORMATION ON AUTOTRADER.IE**

2.1 You can browse Autotrader.ie without telling us who you are or revealing any personal information about yourself.

2.2 When registering as an Advertiser, responding to an advertisement via Autotrader.ie or during your time as an Advertiser or user of Autotrader.ie you may be asked to provide information to us. We will inform you at the time of collecting information from you whether you must provide the information to use Autotrader.ie or a particular Autotrader.ie service, or whether the provision of information requested by us is optional. By agreeing to this Policy you agree that we have informed you at the time of collecting information from you whether the information that you may provide to us will be accessible to other users of Autotrader.ie, other Advertisers or by third parties so that you are in a position to take an informed decision on whether to provide the information to us.

2.3 We may collect and process the following data about you:

3.1 Advertisers partake in Autotrader.ie by placing advertisements for Vehicles for sale. Advertisers are able to manage, change, and remove the advertisements submitted to Autotrader.ie Service through 'My Adverts'. Advertisers need personal login details to access 'My Adverts', which will have been supplied to them on completion of registration with Autotrader.ie.

3.2 Advertisements contain information relating to Vehicles and also limited personal information about Advertisers which Advertisers provide to us.

3.3 We require Autotrader.ie users responding to Advertisements via Autotrader.ie to provide their name, email address, comments addressed to the Advertiser and (optionally) a telephone number to us. Then we email the Advertiser on their behalf, and give the Advertiser this information. Advertisers agree that they will only use the information that we provide to them from Autotrader.ie users for the purposes of dealing with their Advertisement, unless the Autotrader.ie user separately agrees with the Advertiser.

3.4 Separately, Autotrader.ie users can contact the Advertiser directly via an "email the seller" button on Autotrader.ie which allows the Autotrader.ie user to send the Advertiser a message. You agree to only contact an Advertiser using Autotrader.ie or using information that we give to you for the purposes of dealing with the Advertiser's Advertisement, unless the Autotrader.ie user separately agrees with the Advertiser

We may make use of the personal data we have collected from you to enable us to comply with our advertisers' wishes by displaying their advertisement to that target audience. You agree to these practices.

This may happen where our servers or suppliers and service providers are based outside of the EEA or where you use our services and products while visiting countries outside of the EEA. The data protection and other laws of these countries may not be as comprehensive as those in Ireland or the EU but in these instances we will take steps to ensure that your privacy rights are respected.
