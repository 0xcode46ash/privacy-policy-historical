# Autism Speaks, Info, Privacy Policy

[](https://web.archive.org/index.php)

Privacy Policy 

**T** his is the www.autismspeaks.org web site (the “Site”). We recognize that visitors to the Site may be concerned about the information they provide to us, and how we treat that information. This privacy policy addresses those concerns. 

**AutismSpeaks.org's Privacy Policy**

Your privacy on the Internet is important to us. As part of Autism Speaks' operation, we may gather certain types of information about users of the Site, and we would like to explain the types of information we gather, what we do with it and how to correct or change the information. 

**Information Collected By Autism Speaks**

Autism Speaks collects two types of personally identifying information from users: personal data (such as names and e-mail addresses); and aggregated data (such as information about traffic patterns on the Site, or how many users log into the Site on a daily basis). 

**Personal Data**

Personal data is collected when users provide personal data to Autism Speaks, for example by registering through the Site and donating funds. The personal information that you provide must be true, accurate and complete and all registration details (where applicable) must contain your real name, address and other requested details. To update your personal information, please log in to the Site and click on the “Edit Account” tab. 

**Aggregated Information**

Aggregated information, such as information on traffic patterns within the Site, is collected through various methods. 

**IP Addresses**

We collect IP addresses through the Site. An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you're surfing the web. Web servers, the computers that “serve up” web pages, automatically identify your computer by its IP address, and when you request a page from the Site, our servers log your IP address. The Site does not link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable, so although your session will be logged, you will remain anonymous to us. 

**Use of Cookies**

Autism Speaks also uses “cookies” to collect information. A cookie is a small data file that most major web sites write to your hard drive for record keeping purposes when you visit them. Cookies allow us to measure activity on the Site and to improve your user experience, for example by remembering your passwords and viewing preferences. Cookies are used by Autism Speaks to measure activity on the Site and make improvements and updates based on which areas are popular and which are not. Autism Speaks does not use cookies to retrieve information from your computer. Except for personal information voluntarily provided by you (e.g., during subscriber registration), Autism Speaks does not use information transferred through cookies for any promotional or marketing purposes, nor is that information shared with any third parties. 

Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies. If you'd prefer, you can set yours to refuse cookies or to alert you when cookies are being sent. However, it is possible that some parts of the Site will not function properly if you do so. 

**Use of Information Collected by Autism Speaks**

Autism Speaks uses both the personal and aggregated information we collect for multiple purposes. The information is used to improve the content of the Site, to customize the content and/or layout of the Site for each individual user and to notify users about updates to the Site or promotional offers or opportunities that we believe will be of interest to you. We may send you solicitations for donations or invitations to fund-raising events. As applicable, we will share credit card information with financial institutions as needed to process donations made through the Site. 

Autism Speaks may share aggregated information with third parties for both advertising and promotional purposes. 

Upon registration through the Site, we may send you periodic e-mails on a variety of topics. You may elect during registration to receive these e-mails, and you may start or stop receiving such e-mails at any time by sending an e-mail to unsubscribe@autismspeaks.org. Autism Speaks will not share your e-mail address with third parties. Autism Speaks may share postal mailing lists with other non-profits for a one-time use by the other non-profit. If you are a financial donor to Autism Speaks, you may request that we withhold your mailing information from any list exchanges with other non-profits. Please e-mail us at info@autismspeaks.org. In the subject field, type “Mailing List Opt Out” and provide us your name, e-mail or postal address depending on how you made your contribution to our organization. Autism Speaks's lists are never sold to third parties. 

Autism Speaks may also share information with consultants and affiliates for internal business purposes and may divulge personal information if such information is subpoenaed, or if Autism Speaks believes that any user has committed unlawful acts, to acts that endanger the health or safety of another user or of the general public. In some situations, we will share your personal information, on a confidential basis, with third parties who perform a particular service on our behalf, such as sending e-mails. Also, Autism Speaks reserves the right to sell customer information in connection with its merger, acquisition, sale or bankruptcy. 

**Open Forums**

Message boards and chat rooms may be available to visitors of the Site. The forums will identify visitors [as requested by the visitor]. Please remember that any information you disclose in these areas becomes public information. Accordingly, you should always exercise caution when deciding to disclose personal information. 

**Children and Privacy**

Autism Speaks encourages parents and guardians to spend time with their children online, and to be fully familiar with the sites visited by their children. We will not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under age 13. 

**Links to Other Sites**

It is important to note that Autism Speaks contains links to sites other than www.autismspeaks.org, and that those sites may not follow the same privacy policies as Autism Speaks. These sites may send their own cookies to you, and may collect data and make uses of it that Autism Speaks would not. 

**Privacy Protection Procedures**

Protecting your information is important to us. We have implemented appropriate physical, technical and organizational measures, such as using industry-accepted encryption for transmission of credit card information, to help keep your information secure, accurate, current, and complete. In addition, all Autism Speaks agents and contracts with access to personal information obtained on the Autism Speaks web site are bound to adhere to this policy as part of their contract with Autism Speaks.

Autism Speaks protects your personal information in a variety of ways. For certain services, such as our online forums, only minimal personal information is required, such as email addresses. In addition, personal information provided to our walk and donations sites is encrypted. We also protect that account information by placing it on a secure portion of our site that is only accessible by authorized personnel. In addition, IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information. 

Autism Speaks secures its web server architecture through a number of means, including a firewall; closing of non-essential or high-risk services; encryption of user passwords, and secure storage of all backup information. In addition, Autism Speaks conducts regular security reviews of the hardware and software powering the site and makes the appropriate upgrades when required. All hardware access is limited to authorized personnel who must pass through a variety of security measures to access the system. Vendors who have access to the servers are aware of the security restrictions and follow the appropriate protocols to maintain the security of the system.  
 ** ******  
Unfortunately, no transmission of data over the Internet is guaranteed to be completely secure. It may be possible for hackers or other third parties not under the control of Autism Speaks to intercept or access transmissions or private communications unlawfully. While we strive to protect your personal information, Autism Speaks cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us. Any such transmission is done at your own risk.

 **Additional Information**

This privacy policy is personal between you and us, and no one else shall be deemed a third party beneficiary of this policy. 

USE OF THIS SITE SIGNIFIES YOUR AGREEMENT TO THE TERMS OF USE AND THIS PRIVACY POLICY.
