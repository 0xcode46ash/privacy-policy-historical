2\. To provide our Website visitors with the option to receive the Auto Trader monthly email bulletin, as well as the option to receive email and postal offers from selected third party companies that Auto Trader believes may be of interest to them. If a visitor has supplied insurance renewal date information and/or vehicle ownership details, it provides Auto Trader with the potential to better target that visitor with relevant and timely consumer offers by email or post, providing that visitor has opted to receive notification on such offers. 

3\. To support our E-alerts functionality - whereby visitors to our Website can store settings on vehicle searches and/or set up alerts to be notified (by email) - when a specified vehicle appears for sale on the Website. Unless a visitor supplies their email address, we are unable to send such alerts. 

4\. To limit access to the full range of fields within the search form in order to maintain an overall faster search facility. By providing limited access to all our search fields, notably free text entry boxes, we are able to limit the impact on the performance of our search engine during periods of intense user activity. Whilst all users gain unhindered access to the key database fields, (such as Make and Model) fields that generate more intensive database processing (such as free text fields), are limited to those users who register.

5\. To support our 'Send To Mobile' functionality - whereby visitors to our Website can send details of vehicles for sale to mobile phones.

[Why we use cookies]()

**  
Auto Trader uses cookies for 4 purposes:**

  
1\. To enable the delivery of functionality that improves the ease and speed of using the Website (see above). 

2\. To frequency cap display advertisements, particularly pop-up boxes. By limiting advertisement exposure we provide a more compelling user experience for Website visitors and also ensure that advertisements on the Website are more evenly spread across our user base. 

3\. To enable us to track the relative demand for different types of vehicles on the Website. Such information enables us to better target advertising at users searching for specific vehicles. 

4\. To enable us to track the relative popularity of disparate parts of our Website. This in turn enables us to concentrate our efforts on developing those parts of the Website that are generating the greatest consumer demand.

**  
Third Party Cookies**

  
We also use third party cookies on our Website for various purposes, as detailed below: 

**  
Omniture**

  
We use Omniture's software to carry out statistical analysis of page use, page interactions and paths through the Website. This is known as 'web analytics'. We may also record certain information that customers provide during a Website purchase or other process, such as name, email or postcode. We also capture a customer identifier when registered users log in to the Website. 

  
This information allows us to identify customers and more accurately understand individual behaviours and needs. This means that we can more easily tailor offers and information which may be of interest to individuals. We will only send marketing emails when customers have given us permission to do so. Some of our marketing agencies may have access to this along with other data, to help increase the relevancy and performance of our direct marketing. 

**  
Doubleclick**

  
This is a supplier which helps us track the online advertisements which we serve to consumers and the subsequent actions on our Website of those who respond. Our Website pages may contain electronic images which are tracking pixels, these allow us to track user interactions on these pages. They may also report back some information to DoubleClick about the interaction on that page. 

**  
Audience Science**

  
This is one of our online audience monitors that allow us to track customer actions on the Website and to tailor the advertisements you see on 3rd party sites. The content of these advertisements is influenced by your interactions with the Website such as the pages you view, searches you conduct and offers you show an interest in. 

  
Whilst these adverts are based on your individual interactions with autotrader.co.uk online, we do not combine information about these interactions with personal information you provide to us during the registration or transaction process. 

  
If you do not wish to receive such "personalised" advertisements as a result of your behaviour on the Website then please refer to the Audience Science privacy policy <http://www.audiencescience.com/uk/privacy.asp>.

  
You can opt-out of the Audience Science cookie tracking by following the instructions in this pdf: <http://www.audiencescience.com/uk/docs/nai.pdf>

**  
Google Adsense**

  
We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our Website. These companies may also use cookies, over which we have no control.  These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address, or telephone number) about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, click here. 

  
**Video Chat Service  
**

We use a third party supplier to provide the Video Chat Service.  The supplier may use cookies, over which we have no control.  The cookies are used to manage your video chat session, to track your preferences and to personalise your experience.  You may disable persistent cookies.  However, if you disable the session cookie you will not be able to use the Video Chat Service.  If you wish to find out more about the supplier’s use of cookies please refer to their privacy policy at <http://www.contactatonce.com/service/serviceprivacy.html>

**  
Automatic Logging of Session Data**

  
We automatically log generic information about your computer and your computer's connection to the Internet which we call "session data".  Session data consists of things such as device information, IP address, operating system and browser software information, and the activities conducted by you while on our Website.  An IP address is a number that lets computers attached to the Internet, such as our web servers, know where to send data back to the user, such as the pages of the Website the user wishes to view.  We collect session data because it helps us to analyse such things as what items visitors are likely to click on most, the way visitors are clicking through the Website, how many visitors are surfing to various pages on the Website, how long visitors to the Website are staying and how often they are visiting.  It also helps us diagnose problems with our servers and lets us better administer our systems.  It is possible to determine from an IP address a visitor’s Internet Service provider (ISP) and the approximate geographical location of his or her point of connectivity.  We may also use some session data, such as the pages you have visited on our Website, to send you e-mail messages focused on matters that you may be interested in, unless you have previously opted out of receiving such messages.  We also use session data to help prevent fraud and unauthorised use of our Website.

**  
Why are we collecting this information?**

  
Your address 

  
We ask for your address for two reasons: 

  
1\. When you have logged onto the Website, your postcode will automatically populate the postcode box on the search form. All search results will automatically be displayed with those closest to your home first, until you choose to sort your search results using different criteria e.g. price. 

2\. Your address allows us to send you updates on our Website and/or offers from our partners, provided you have opted to receive such notifications in stage 4 of this registration process. 

  
Your mobile number 

  
Collecting your mobile number will enable us to provide you with SMS vehicle alerts, should you choose to accept them, when they launch early next year. These alerts will provide you with notification by SMS on any new vehicles ads you have requested to be told about as they first appear onto the Website. 

  
Insurance renewal date 

  
Thanks to our long running associations with the Motor Trade, we often hear about exciting deals on insurance. By providing us with details on your renewal date, we can ensure we target you with the best offers, when they’re most relevant. 

[Offensive or misleading adverts or content]()

  
If you notice any offensive or unsuitable adverts or content on the Website, please email [enquiries@autotrader.co.uk](mailto:enquiries@autotrader.co.uk) or call 0845 345 3450.
