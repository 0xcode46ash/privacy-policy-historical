# AAA - Privacy Statement

## Important Notice Concerning Your Privacy

At AAA Michigan, maintaining your trust and confidence is a high priority. That is why we want you to understand how we protect your privacy when we collect and use information about you and the measures we take to safeguard that information. We also want you to understand the benefits of your relationship with us, including valuable offers you may receive through the mail, online or by telephone, and how you can let us know if you prefer not to receive these offers ( _opt out_ ). The companies listed below are all related by common control or ownership and are referred to in this Notice as _Affiliates_ , _we_ , _our_ and _us_.

#### Information We Collect

As part of providing you with our products and services, we obtain nonpublic personal information ( _Customer Information_ ) about you, including:

  * Information we receive from you on applications, surveys, online registrations or other forms, such as your name, address and date of birth
  * Information about your AAA Membership, insurance needs, driving record, claims history and other financial transactions with us and others
  * Information about your creditworthiness, credit history and other information about you that we obtain from consumer reporting agencies, other companies we work with or providers of marketing and demographic information, including information that may indicate your purchasing preferences and information obtained in connection with our efforts to protect against insurance fraud



#### Information Security

Only those persons who need it to perform their job responsibilities are authorized to have access to Customer Information. In addition, we maintain physical, electronic and procedural security measures that comply with legal requirements to safeguard Customer Information.

#### Disclosures to Service Your Account

To provide customer service to you; process your insurance, financial services, or membership transactions; conduct research and analysis; and to deliver your membership benefits and programs, it is often necessary for us to disclose Customer Information to companies that work with us. For example, we may provide certain Customer Information to companies, including our Affiliates, that perform services in connection with customer benefits, services or programs, or that perform other business operations or services, including marketing services, on our behalf. We may also provide certain Customer Information to companies that offer AAA Member programs in which you have enrolled or which are provided as part of your AAA Membership or to other financial institutions with which we have joint marketing agreements. We may provide certain Customer Information to others outside our affiliated companies as permitted by law, such as to government entities or other third parties in response to subpoenas or to consumer reporting agencies.

#### Disclosures to Provide You With Offers for Products & Services

An important benefit of your customer relationship with us is the opportunity to receive offers for products and services from companies that provide special programs, services or discounts especially for AAA Members. We try to provide these offers to customers who are most likely to find them of value.

#### Offers for AAA Products & Services

We work with our Affiliates and other companies that perform marketing services on our behalf to develop and make offers to you of products and services of AAA and our Affiliates based on Customer Information.

#### Offers for Products & Services of Other Companies

We work with other companies to provide our customers with special offers for various products and services. We may disclose Customer Information about you to financial service providers, such as banks and insurance companies; nonfinancial companies, such as retailers, direct marketers and travel providers; and others, such as other AAA clubs or their affiliated companies.

If you prefer, you may opt out of these disclosures; that is, you may direct us not to make disclosures to nonaffiliated third parties (other than disclosures permitted by law). You may opt out by filling out and returning the form below. If you opt out, you will not receive offers for products and services that result from these disclosures. However, we may still include notices and information about other products and services when communicating with you about your account and related products and services. You may also still receive mailings that are developed independently and are not based on Customer Information. The request from any customer of ours residing in your household will apply to all of our customers in your household as well.

#### Disclosures to Other Affiliated Companies

Our Affiliates include a number of related membership, travel, insurance and financial services providers. We are permitted by law to share with our Affiliates information about our transactions or experiences with you, such as your account balances and payment history. You may direct us not to share credit-related or other information shown on consumer reports with our Affiliates, except as permitted by law.

If you prefer that we not share this credit-related information with other Affiliates, you may direct us not to by selecting that choice on the form below and returning it to us. If you opt out, we may still share information with our Affiliates as permitted by law, but you may not receive offers for other products or services that may be of value to you.

#### Former Customers

If you decide to terminate your customer relationship with one of our companies or your account becomes inactive or is closed for some other reason, we will continue to treat and safeguard your Customer Information as described in this Notice.

#### Our Affiliates

Our affiliates include AAA clubs; auto, home and life insurance companies; insurance agencies; and companies that offer other financial services, such as trust services and securities products.
