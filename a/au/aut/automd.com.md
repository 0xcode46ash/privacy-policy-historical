# AutoMD

### Effective September 1, 2009

  


### WHO WE ARE

This is the AUTOMD ("AUTOMD") Internet Privacy Policy. You can write to us at PO Box 1234, Long Beach, CA 90803. We can also be reached by email at [privacy@automd.com](mailto:privacy@automd.com).

AUTOMD values individual privacy and we want to give our website visitors the opportunity to know what information we collect about you and how you can limit the use of personally-identifiable information beyond the purposes for which you first provided it. At all times, however, AUTOMD reserves the right to disclose information where required by law or to comply with valid legal process (such as a search warrant, subpoena or court order), to protect AUTOMD's rights or property, including without limitation in the event of a transfer of control of AUTOMD or substantially all of its assets, where we suspect that illegal activity or fraud is taking place, to cooperate with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and risk reductions, or during emergencies when safety is at risk.

Whenever we change our policy, we will give reasonable notice by posting a notice on our home page. Since these policy change notices last only for a limited time, however, you should check this Privacy Policy regularly to see if there have been any changes. To view our Privacy Policy at any time go to [www.automd.com/default/privacy_policy](https://web.archive.org/default/privacy_policy).

### DATA WE COLLECT AND HOW WE USE IT

  


### Personally Identifiable Information

We collect your email address if you communicate with us by email, as well as other information that you might supply voluntarily, such as name, physical address, telephone number, survey information or registration information for you and your particular vehicle or vehicles. If you purchase a product or service at our site we will also ask for your credit card number or other account number that you wish to be charged. We do not give out your credit card or other account information to third parties unless you authorize us to do so or if it is necessary to fulfill our responsibilities, including, but not limited to, delivering a product or service you order. If you get to a third party provider of products and services through our site, that party will have its own privacy policy and we will not share your credit card or account information to that third party unless you expressly give us permission to do so.

We may use your personal information to respond to an email or other inquiry or request, to help improve our website and our services, to customize your experience at our website, or to send updates or notices about our organization and the products we offer that we think may be of interest to you. We may also combine this information with other generally or publicly available information to help us identify visitors' preferences or interests. We may provide information that identifies you to companies that assist us in these activities, such as helping us fulfill your request for a product, service or information, or to maintain up-to-date information on servicing and maintaining your vehicle. Further, with your express approval, AUTOMD may occasionally provide, sell, or rent limited data to third parties, including companies that offer products and services for sale to our members. This limited data may include name and email address.

### Children's Privacy

AUTOMD's website is intended for adults. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13. If we obtain knowledge that we have personally identifiable information about a child under 13 in retrievable form in our files, AUTOMD will delete that information from our existing files.

### Cookies & Computer-Related Information

AUTOMD enables "cookies" on our website. This information may be used by our staff to detect and resolve website problems and to assist with customer support.

When you visit our site, we automatically receive and store any information you enter on our website. For example, you provide information when you search for a particular problem or diagnosis; register your vehicle or provide information in your account; communicate with us by e-mail; complete a questionnaire or any other way. As a result of those actions, you might supply us with such information as your name, address, and phone numbers; financial information, such as credit card or bank account numbers, including Social Security and driver's license numbers; transactional information based on your activities on the Site and content you generate or that relates to your account, correspondence through the Site, and correspondence sent to us.

Whenever you interact with us, we collect and analyze some data about you, which may include the full Uniform Resource Locator (URL) click stream to, through and from our website, including date and time; cookie number; products you viewed or searched for; and the phone number you used to call our 800 number. Your IP address is used for automd.com internal use only and helps us diagnose problems with our server and administer our web site. We also automatically track certain information about your activities on our web site. These may include: browser type and version, operating system and platform; statistics on page views, traffic to and from the Site, and ad data; standard web log information; and purchase history. We use this information to do internal research on your interests and to help us better understand and serve you. If you are a registered automd.com customer, we link this automatically-collected data to your personally identifiable information. We may collect and measure session information, including page response times, download errors, length of visits to certain pages, page interaction information (such as scrolling, clicks, and mouse-overs), and methods used to browse away from the page. We may also share statistical or demographic information in aggregate form with third parties for marketing or research purposes. This aggregate data will not contain any information that personally identifies you.

### How You Can Control and Update Data About You

We want to be sure that we keep only the most accurate and up-to-date information about you in our records. Therefore, whenever you believe that your contact information needs to be updated, you can email us at [contactinfo@automd.com](mailto:contactinfo@automd.com) to correct or update your contact information. You may choose at any time to remove your name, telephone and fax numbers, and postal and email addresses from the lists we use to send notices or updates and elect not to receive correspondence from us by emailing at [privacy@automd.com](mailto:privacy@automd.com). Users may request that AUTOMD refrain from disclosing to third parties the data it collects on our vehicle registration forms by refraining from checking the "opt-in" box that appears on each form on which a user provides information. Alternatively, users may contact us at [privacy@automd.com](mailto:privacy@automd.com).

Other Internet sites you visit – including those linked from the AUTOMD website – may have their own privacy policies or no policy at all. Other websites might use personal information differently than our policy permits. We strongly encourage you to review the privacy policies of any site before providing any personal information.

### Data Integrity and Security

We use state-of-the-art technology to keep any information you provide as secure as possible and are PCI compliant. For instance, we use Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology, which is supported by the vast majority of modern Internet browsers. SSL works best when you are using the latest 128-bit encryption version of Microsoft Internet Explorer. SSL technology represents the highest level of security available on the Internet. It automatically encrypts information traveling over the Internet, verifies the identity of the transacting servers through certificates and digital signatures, and confirms that the integrity of message content is maintained throughout transmission.

We also have in place privacy protection control contractual obligations with our vendors designed to ensure that personal data is protected from unauthorized access or disclosure. All AUTOMD employees must abide by our Privacy Policy. Only authorized employees are permitted to have access to personally identifiable data about website visitors, and that access is limited to what is reasonably needed to perform an employee's responsibilities, such as providing updates or notices or customer service. Employees who violate our privacy policies are subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination.
