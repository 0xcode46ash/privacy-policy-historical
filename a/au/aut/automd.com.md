**Usage and disclosure**

In general, we use Personal Information we collect from you to facilitate your use of the AutoMD Services, including without limitation, to process your requests or transactions, to provide you with information, products and other Services you request, to administer and assist us with the operation of the Site and of our business, and for the purpose for which the information was provided. For example, we may use the information we collect: 

  * to send you a welcoming email and to contact you about your use of the Site, such as for administrative purposes or to provide you with customer service;
  * if you are an auto repair professional, auto repair shop or auto repair service provider, to verify your identity when attempting to claim your profile;
  * to respond to your emails, submissions, comments, requests or complaints;
  * to request feedback and to enable us to analyze, develop, customize and improve the Site and our information and other Services; and

Once your credit card is Synced within the matchback process, it is referenced by a unique identifier code rather than by the actual credit card number. The matchback process provides AutoMD with the date of the transaction, the amount, the unique merchant identifier code from the participating Shop, and the unique credit card identifier code which allows AutoMD to credit your Synced credit card with the AutoMD Insta-Quotes!

Cash Back Rebate amount.



In the event that we engage or partner with a trusted business or person, including without limitation, third party vendors, consultants or other service providers in connection with the operation of the Site and our business (“Service Providers”), we may share Personal Information with such Service Providers who need access to such information to carry out their work for us. For example, we may use mapping or location based services companies to provide information on services available near your location. In addition, we may offer various features through a third party service provider. 

When you use these services, you are providing information directly to the provider of these services, and the provision of such information is subject to such party's own privacy policy. We are not responsible for the actions of Service Providers or other third parties or for any information you provide to these parties directly, and we encourage you to become familiar with their practices before disclosing information directly to such third parties with which you come into contact.

We encourage you to be aware when you leave our Site and to read the privacy policies of any web site that collects personally identifiable information. Similarly, if you entered this Site through another web site, we are also not responsible for the privacy practices of that site, and you should review the privacy policy of the originating site before providing any Personal Information to that site. This privacy policy applies solely to information collected by us.

If AutoMD becomes involved in a merger, acquisition, or any form of sale of some or all of its assets, we will ensure the confidentiality of any Personal Information involved in such transactions and provide notice before Personal Information is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.

### Information security

We take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of data.
