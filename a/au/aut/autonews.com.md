# Automotive News

This is the web site of Automotive News. Our postal address is 1400 Woodbridge, Detroit, MI 48207. We can be reached by email at [autonews@crain.com](mailto:autonews@crain.com) or by telephone at 313-446-6000. 

The Automotive News Group, publishers of automotivenews.com, has developed this Privacy Policy to advise site users of our possible uses of information collected during an automotivenews.com visit.

For each visitor to automotivenews.com, our web server automatically attempts to identify the user's domain name, but not the e-mail address. We collect and store the domain name of automotivenews.com users in our log files. We also track information, in aggregate, on pages and features that users access or view. 

Users electing to search the data and/or archives of automotivenews.com are required to supply personal and professional information during a "registration" process prior to using the search function. Occasionally, we may also collect information volunteered by the user, such as survey information or contest entries.

Information collected about users may be used by the Automotive News Group (and our partnering companies) to provide users with the features of the site, for audits, to perform statistical analysis of user behavior in order to measure interest in various areas of our site (for product development purposes) and to inform advertisers as to how many users have seen or "clicked" their advertising banners. We will disclose site usage information to third parties only in aggregate.

From time to time, we many make individual user information available to carefully selected third parties to send you information through e-mail or postal mail about their products or services. During the registration process, a user can indicate on the registration form that he or she does not wish to receive such marketing materials via e-mail or postal mail. Additionally, a user can indicate that he or she doesn not want to receive news about new site features or marketing materials from the Automotive News Group via e-mail. The Automotive News Group retains the right to contact a registered user regarding account status or changes to the registration agreement. 

The Automotive News Group will remove any registrant (and their personal information) from our database pursuant to a request from the registrant, including full name and user name, to [autonews@crain.com](mailto:autonews@crain.com) , or allow any registrant to "opt out" of further contact (while still allowing access to the search function) or change/correct personal information online at [http://automotivenews.com](http://autonews.com/). 

If you provided your postal mail address during registration and do not wish to receive marketing mailings from the Automotive News Group, you may remove your name by sending an email to [autonews@crain.com](mailto:autonews@crain.com) with "Do Not Mail" in the subject line along with your full name or by calling us at 313-446-6000.
