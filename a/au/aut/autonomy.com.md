# General Privacy Policy

## Autonomy's Products and Your Privacy

With respect to Autonomy technology and products, Autonomy makes every endeavor to ensure that all of our products enable our customers to protect the privacy of their end-users. However, it is the responsibility of Autonomy customers and partners to implement their Autonomy systems in such a way as to ensure the security of end-user information.

As standard, Autonomy products do not require users to enter any personal information to operate the products, but simply to select a user id and password. Autonomy profiling uses the conceptual context of the information users browse and read, and therefore does not require personal demographic information such as address, age, etc.

In some cases users can optionally elect to have email sent to them, the email address is stored in an encrypted format on the server.

**Peggy Kjelgaard, VHA** \- "The Clinical Knowledge Management suite of services leverages member capabilities, knowledge, information sources and networks to accelerate creating, identifying, spreading and sustaining health care improvements and innovations. We would have an extremely difficult time handling this wealth of information if were to rely on a manual system for tagging and delivering this information. Autonomy is the primary technology we use to automatically manage dynamic content sources across CKM, the Web and member hospitals."

**Jean-Pierre Krause, Zurich** \- "There is a lot of useful information out there, but the key to using it is to first make sense of it. This entails understanding the content, sending it to the right person and linking it to other pertinent information and people. Speed is another critical factor, thus all this should happen in a non-labour-intensive manner - that is, completely automatically. That is what Autonomy, uniquely, now enables us to do. It is the engine of our KnowledgeNavigator."
