Information Autobytel.com Collects 

Autobytel.com collects e-mail addresses of consumers who communicate with us via e-mail. Information on web pages visited and other information volunteered by consumers such as survey information and/or site registrations are also collected. Information collected for purchase requests includes name, address, and phone numbers, e-mail address and specific vehicle information.   
Collected information is used to improve the content of our Web site, customize the content and/or layout of our Web site for individual users, notification of updates to our Web site and is also used to contact consumers for marketing purposes. Purchase request information is used to route requests to our accredited dealers, manufacturers and fulfillment partners, and to contact consumers regarding vehicle purchases. This information may be shared with other reputable organizations only if the consumer gives permission. 

Who Owns Purchase Request Data? 

Purchase Request information, including your name, e-mail address, home address and vehicle information, becomes the property of Autobytel.com once it is received in our database. This information is passed on to our accredited dealers, manufacturers and fulfillment partners for completion of the sale pursuant to contractual rights granted by Autobytel.com. Once our accredited dealer receives this information, it becomes the property of the dealership in addition to Autobytel.com. Our accredited dealers use this information to process your purchase request and provide valuable services. Any request to opt out of future dealer communications must be made directly to the dealer. 

Personalization

Autobytel.com offers its users the advantage of personalization on our Web site by using cookies. (see Cookies) You will see this personalization in the "My Garage" area, in the saving of favorite vehicle information in "My Wishlist" and used vehicle searches. Personalization in the "My Garage" area creates an individual experience for users by displaying the user's name and current vehicle information.   
If you use our used vehicle searches, our Web site will remember your login name. Our used car page will remember previous vehicle searches you have made. Web site personalization provides our customers with a more convenient online experience and is at no given time used to track information or retrieve data from your hard drive. 

Cookies

Autobytel.com offers consumers the convenience of online personalization by using cookies. Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that are transferred to your computer's hard drive through your web browser. When this information is stored on your hard drive, our system is able to recognize your browser and in turn customize web page content for you. (See Personalization) 

Cookies cannot be used to retrieve data from your hard drive, obtain your e-mail address or obtain sensitive information about you. When a cookie is set, your browser will check it for length, an expiration date, and where it originated. Only Autobytel.com can access the cookies that we set. 

Autobytel.com allows our ad service company to set cookies as well. These cookies can "recognize" a consumer by a Unique identifier assigned at the time of the first visit, and may be used to measure site and page visits and browser version number. These cookies can not obtain private information like name, e-mail or other personal information, and are not shared with Autobytel.com. 

We use a third party tracking service who sets cookies on our site to track visits, page views and click stream behavior. The third party tracking service reports this data to use in aggregate so we can better understand our users and to improve our site. This information is not tied to any individual user. 

If you prefer not to accept cookies, most browsers will explain how to disable cookies under the help portion of the toolbar or notify you when you receive a new cookie. However, if you choose to disallow cookies on your hard drive, our Web site will not be able to provide personalization services. 

Shared information 

Occasionally, when Autobytel.com does not have an accredited dealership available to assist our consumers we may forward your request information to a dealer at Autoweb.com or CarSmart.com, two other well-known online automotive referral services operated by Autobytel Inc. You will be notified that your information is forwarded at the time you submit your purchase request. At that time you will become subject to the security and privacy policies that are posted on those Web sites at [www.autoweb.com](http://www.autoweb.com/), or [www.CarSmart.com](http://www.carsmart.com/). If you have further questions about the Autoweb.com Privacy Policy you may contact Autoweb.com Customer Service at [ConsumerCare@autoweb.com](mailto:ConsumerCare@autoweb.com). For CarSmart.com please contact CarSmart customer service at [custserv@carsmart.com](mailto:custserv@carsmart.com).

Outside Providers of Service 

Autobytel.com partners with outside service providers for some of the products and services offered. Certain of such partnerships are found on our Finance, Insurance and Warranty pages. The information these partners provide will be presented in a "framed" format, where the Autobytel.com border will surround the pages served by the partner. 

Although Autobytel.com makes every attempt to work only with credible service provider partners, please be aware that you will be subject to these outside partners' security and privacy policies once you leave our Web site. We encourage you to read the privacy policies of these outside service providers, because their privacy practices may differ from ours.

Autobyel.com offers forums on its site. Please note that disclosing personally identifiable information online through Chat Rooms, Forums, and Message Boards makes the information submitted public, even though the forum is limited to registered members.
