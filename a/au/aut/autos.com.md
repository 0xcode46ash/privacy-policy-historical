If you are only browsing, we collect the following information: IP address, the type of browser and operating system used to access our Site, the date and time you access our Site, the pages you visit (click-through), and if you linked to our website from another website, the address of that website as well as additional information related to your visit.

**Information Collected**

There will be times, such as when you communicate with us by e-mail, submit an application, request a quote, request special financing, enter a contest or sweepstakes, purchase a product, etc., when we will need to obtain personally identifiable information from you or about you. Such personally identifiable information may include your name, home address, residence information, employment information, e-mail address, telephone number, social security number, financial information, bankruptcy history, credit references, etc. Consumers who submit an application, request a quote or request special financing expressly authorize us and up to four (4) third party partners to contact them in connection with each application and/or request regardless of whether or not such consumer is listed on a "Do Not Call" list. 

At no time will we sell your personally-identifiable data without your permission. The information we receive about you or from you may be used by us or shared (including evaluating and obtaining financial products or services) by us with our corporate affiliates, agents, vendors and other third parties to help process your request or complete a transaction; to comply with any law, regulation, audit or court order; to help improve our website or the products or services we offer; for research; to better understand our customers' needs; to develop new offerings; and to alert you to new products and services (of us or our business associates) in which you may be interested. We may also combine information you provide us with information about you that is available to us internally or from other sources. We believe that knowing more about you can enable us to serve you better. 

We may also aggregate your personal information with others' information and prepare reports on site usage, purchase history or other factors for sale or distribution to others. Those reports are aggregated and include no personally identifying information. Finally, we may use your personal information to send you email or postal communications regarding products or services offered by us or by third parties with whom we have relationships in which we think you may be interested. We do not share, sell, trade or rent your personal information to third parties for unknown reasons. You may at any time choose not to receive promotional emails from us by contacting us at [unsubscribe@Autos.com](mailto:unsubscribe@Autos.com). Notwithstanding the foregoing, we may continue to contact you for the purpose of communicating information relating to Autos.com, as well as to facilitate, complete, or confirm any transaction that you may enter into or responding to your inquiry or request. 

If you prefer for us not to provide your name and email or postal address to third parties for direct marketing purposes, please contact us at [unsubscribe@Autos.com](mailto:unsubscribe@Autos.com). 

We collect nonpublic personal information about you from the following sources: 

  * Information we receive from you on applications on our website or other forms; 
  * Information about your transactions with us, our affiliates, or others; and 
  * Information about you we may receive from credit reporting agencies. 



We may disclose all of the information we collect, as described above, to financial institutions, dealership lender partners, local dealers and other third parties that provide financing referral services to explore financing options to process your credit request. 

We also may disclose non-public personal information about you to non-affiliated third parties as permitted by law. 

All information provided by consumers in any of the above-listed ways or otherwise may be used and disclosed as permitted in this Policy. 

Information submitted to us in connection with a financing request is used to transmit the request to third parties who may be in a position to respond to your request. We do not provide financing, but instead transmit those requests to third-party vendors for consideration. 

Federal law requires all financial institutions to obtain, verify and record information that identifies each person who opens an account. When you submit a financing application, your name, residential address, date of birth and social security number will be used to verify your identity. In addition, as part of the request process, we may verify the information you provide, or obtain omitted address or other contact information from third parties.

**Security**

We safeguard your personal data (e.g., credit card and finance application information) during electronic transmission from you to us using known encryption, security standards and procedures. We restrict access to non-public personal information about you only to those employees who need to know that information in order to provide products or services to you. We maintain physical, electronic and other procedural safeguards to comply with applicable privacy laws to guard your nonpublic personal information. We also assess new technology for protecting sensitive customer information on an ongoing basis. However, if your information is forwarded to a dealership or other third party provider, your information will be transmitted according to the security and privacy policies of that dealership or third party provider whose privacy practices may differ from ours. Your information as shared with outside providers will become subject to those different privacy policies. 

Due to federal and state regulations, we are required to keep a copy of your information for a period of 3 years. Over this period, we will maintain all such data in a confidential and secure area that third parties will not be allowed to access.
