# Privacy Policy - Twilio

Twilio is a cloud communications company. Our products and services enable you to build communications features and capabilities into your web, desktop and mobile software applications.

Here at Twilio, we believe in a “no shenanigans” approach to privacy. That means we do our best to be thoughtful and deal in an honest, direct and transparent way when it comes to your data.

In that spirit of transparency, we encourage you to read about our privacy practices.

To help you find the information most relevant to you, we’ve put together three separate privacy notices.

Check out our [Website Privacy Notice](https://web.archive.org/legal/privacy/website), If you’re interested in our privacy practices with respect to data collected from you when you visit our publicly-accessible website www.twilio.com. 

Check out our [Developer Products and Account Portal Privacy Notice](https://web.archive.org/legal/privacy/developer), if you’re interested in our privacy practices with respect to data collected from you or generated when you use our account portal and developer products and services.

Check out our [Authy App Privacy Notice](https://web.archive.org/legal/privacy/authy), if you’re an individual user of the Authy desktop or mobile app and/or you’re interested in our privacy practices regarding data collected in connection with use of the Authy desktop or mobile app. 

If you’re just interested in our use of tracking technologies like Cookies, check out our [Cookie Notice](https://web.archive.org/legal/privacy/cookies).

### Summary of Changes to Privacy Policy

#### What we have NOT changed

We have not changed how we handle or secure data we collect from you on our website or in connection with your use of our products and services.

#### What we HAVE changed

 **February 1, 2016 Updates:**

  * We changed the format of our privacy policy to try to make it easier to understand and find the information relevant to you.
  * Instead of one privacy notice covering (1) our website, (2) our developer products and account portal, and (3) our Authy app, we have broken it out into three separate notices that focus on our processing of data as to each of those three things.
  * We included a summary version for each of our privacy notices for quick reference. While it isn’t the “legal version,” it gives you a quick summary of what the accompanying full version of the privacy notice says.
  * We’ve also added tables of contents with links to allow you to navigate to the portion of the privacy notice you’re most interested more quickly.
  * We made changes to the International Operations and Transfers Out of the EEA and Switzerland sections of our privacy policies in response to the October 6, 2015 determination by the European Court of Justice that the Safe Harbor Framework no longer provides a valid basis for transfers from the European Economic Area (EEA) countries to the United States. While Twilio now uses alternative mechanisms to the Safe Harbor Framework to transfer data from EEA countries to the United States, Twilio continues to be certified under the Safe Harbor Framework, abides by the Framework, and adheres to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles. Twilio is hopeful that a new Safe Harbor program will be put into place. Nonetheless, in the interim, in our Developer Products and Account Portal Privacy Policy, we’ve noted that, as appropriate, Twilio will enter into the Twilio Inc. Data Processing Agreement, which incorporates standard contractual clauses deemed by the European Commission to offer adequate data protection and safeguards in relation to any transfer of Personal Data out of the European Economic Area. Please see our [Terms of Service](https://web.archive.org/legal/tos) for more information.
  * We added that if you are an individual who has downloaded the Authy app outside of the United States, the Authy App service is provided to you by Twilio Ireland Limited, located at 25-28 North Wall Quay, Dublin 1, Ireland. Twilio Ireland Limited is the controller of personal data processed for the purposes of account management and service-related analytics.
  * And, we’ve included information about our alternative dispute resolution process if we have a dispute about our products or services.



 **April 12, 2016 Update:**

  * We updated our [Developer Products and Account Portal Privacy Notice](https://web.archive.org/legal/privacy/developer) with the announcement of our integration with OTT messaging services like Facebook Messenger and Viber. In that update, we clarified that when you choose to use our products and services to send or receive communications through OTT messaging service providers we connect with, like Facebook Messenger or Viber, those providers will handle your communications in accordance with their own policies.



 **May 24, 2016 Update:**

  * We updated our Developer Products and Account Portal Privacy Notice with the announcement of the Twilio Marketplace. In that update, we clarified that when you make use of an Add-on from one of our Add-on Partners, any data the Add-on Partner accesses or collects as necessary for you to make use of the Add-on will be handled by the Add-on Partner in accordance with the Add-on Partner’s own policies, not Twilio’s.



 **September 26, 2016 Update:**

  * We updated each of our Privacy Notices to provide notice that Twilio has certified with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of “personal data” (as defined under the Privacy Shield principles) from applicable European Union member countries. You can access our Privacy Shield Statement [here](https://web.archive.org/legal/privacy/shield).
  * We also added that we do not knowingly collect data from children under the age of 13.
  * We updated our Developer Products and Account Portal Privacy Notice to further notify you that we share address and other similar information you provide or collected from your use of our service with third party fraud detection or identity validation service providers to confirm that the information you provide to us is accurate and you are who you say you are.



 **January 24, 2017 Update:**

  * We updated the Authy app notice to clarify what data we collect from users of the Authy app and what information we share back with websites and programs that integrate with the Authy API for purposes of verifying your identity and securing your online accounts.



 **July 21, 2017 Update:**

  * We updated each of our Privacy Notices to provide notice that effective as of the date that our certification is posted at <https://www.privacyshield.gov/>, Twilio will be certified with the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of “personal data” (as defined under the Privacy Shield Principles) from Switzerland. You can access our updated Privacy Shield Statement [here](https://web.archive.org/legal/privacy/shield).
