# [Autowini.com] Privacy Policy

Any body can browse our website without telling us who they are or revealing any personal information about themselves. Once they give us their personal information, they are not anonymous to us anymore. If they choose to provide us with their personal information, they consent to the transfer and storage of that information on our servers which is located in Seoul, South Korea.

The information we gather falls into two categories:   
(1) Information supplied by visitors to the site when they list a car for sale, perform a search, enter a sweepstakes or other promotional contest, or inquire about an item listed for sale or about another product or service offered through our website.  
(2) Tracking information gathered as visitors navigate through our website. Third-party providers featured on or linked to by our website, such as vendors of products and services offered through our site, may be gathering information, as well, through processes we don't control.
