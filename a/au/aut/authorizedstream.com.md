We track the music played through the FreeStreams Service and report it to our third party partners in
the aggregate in order to meet their obligation to report and pay copyright owners and for other lawful

personally-identifiable information.
We work with third party online advertising networks to deliver advertising on the FreeStreams Service.
Such third parties may utilize cookies or other tracking and targeting technologies. We are not
responsible for information collected by third party advertisers in this manner, nor for the collection or
use of information by other sites to which the FreeStreams Service is linked.


You should consult the respective privacy policies of these third-party ad servers, ad networks, and
websites for more information on their practices and for instructions on how to opt-out of certain
practices. Any data obtained by third-party ad servers subsequently shared with us is maintained and
dealt with by us in accordance with this privacy policy. When you access the FreeStreams Service
through a service partner, we may add your email address or other personalized information, so that we
can identify which of our service partners or other sign-in pages to send to you when you log on.
We may also collect information about the devices you use to access the FreeStreams Service. This
information may include your IP address, browser type, and other software or hardware information.
We also may collect a unique device identifier assigned to that device or other transactional information
for that device.
Information We Receive From Third Parties
We may receive information about you from third parties and store it in our databases with personally
identifiable information that you provide to us. These third parties may include advertisers that make
features available through the FreeStreams Service, access partners, and marketing companies that
create or sell other marketing data. FreeStreams is only responsible for abiding by its own privacy policy
and will assume no liability if a business partner or other entity collects, uses or shares any information
about you in violation of its own privacy policy or applicable law.
Use of Information
We use your personal information and non-personal information to provide you with services, to notify
you of new products or services, and communicate with you. We also use the information that we
collect for the following purposes:
• To customize and personalize the advertising and the content you see and hear.
• To enhance the listener experience in our network of websites and broadcasts. We use tracking
information to enhance our offering.
• To fulfill your requests to receive information or services and permit you to interact with the
FreeStreams Service.
• To send you alerts on developments and features that may be of interest.
Consent to Sharing Information
We may rent, sell, and share your personal information and non-personal information with our network
partners and third-party affiliates for the purposes of direct mail, email marketing, mobile marketing,
and telemarketing. Additionally, we may share such personal information with the broadcaster to whose
station you use.
By providing personal information to us you agree:


• all information you have provided is true and correct to the best of your knowledge;
• you are establishing a business relationship with FreeStreams and with its marketing partners; and
• you are requesting and expressly consenting to be contacted via telephone (whether wireless or
wired), including by live or prerecorded, calls using an automated dialing system, email, and/or mail by
us, our network partners, and third-party affiliates and marketing partners regardless of whether your
telephone number is on any Do Not Call list(s)
• From time to time, we may establish a business relationship with other businesses and third party
marketing partners whom we believe trustworthy and who have confirmed that their privacy practices
are consistent with ours ("Service Providers"). For example, we may contract with Service Providers and
third-party marketing partners to provide certain services, such as hosting and maintenance, customer
relationship management, data storage and management, and direct marketing campaigns. We provide
our Service Providers and/or third-party marketing partners with the information necessary for them to
perform these services on our behalf. Each Service Provider and/or third-party marketing partner must
agree to use reasonable security procedures and practices, appropriate to the nature of the information
involved, in order to protect your Personal Information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure.
We may work with third-party marketing and advertising companies ("Ad Networks"). These companies
may collect and use information about your use of the FreeStreams Service or services in order to
provide advertisements about goods and services that may be of interest to you. Advertisements may
be shown via the FreeStreams Service, the services, or third-party sites. These companies may use
cookies or other tracking technologies. Our Privacy Policy does not cover any use of information that an
Ad Network may collect from you. It also does not cover any information that you may choose to
provide to an Ad Network or to an advertiser whose goods or services are advertised through the
Service. For such information, you are subject to the terms of the Ad Networks’ privacy policy. We may
share personal information and non-personal information with businesses controlling, controlled by, or
under common control with FreeStreams. If FreeStreams is merged, acquired, or sold, or in the event of
a transfer of some or all of our assets, we may disclose or transfer personal information and non-
personal information in connection with such transaction. We shall also cooperate with government and
law enforcement officials and private parties to enforce and comply with the law. We may disclose
personal information and non-personal information about you to government or law enforcement
officials or private parties if, in our discretion, we believe it is necessary or appropriate in order to
respond to legal requests (including court orders and subpoenas), to protect the safety, property or
rights of FreeStreams or of any third party, to prevent or stop any illegal, unethical, or legally actionable
activity, or to comply with the law.
Children's Privacy
We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13. If we receive
personal information from a child under the age of 13, we will delete such information from our records
once we learn of it.


External Links
The Service may contain links to other sites, or allow others to send you such links. A link to a third
party's site does not mean that we endorse it or that we are affiliated with it. We do not exercise control
over third-party sites. You access such third-party sites or content at your own risk. You should always
read the privacy policy of a third-party site before providing any information to the site.
