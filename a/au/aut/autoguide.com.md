Privacy Policy

  
Welcome to Recycler.com. We believe in your right to know what information is collected during your visit to our site and how the information is used and safeguarded. 

The information gathered by Recycler.com falls into two categories: 

1\. Information voluntarily supplied by visitors to our site through optional registration.

2\. Tracking information gathered as visitors navigate through our site.

**Information Gathered By Voluntary Submission**  
To make use of certain features on our site (such as Submit an Ad, or Save Ad to My Saved Ads, etc.) visitors need to register and to provide certain information as part of the registration or participation process. From time to time, we may ask, for example, for information such as your address, zip code, interest in sports, personal finance, the performing arts, and the like.  Although providing this information is entirely voluntary, the information you supply will help us to offer you more personalized features, to tailor our site to your interests and make it more useful to you. The more you tell us about yourself, the more value we can offer you.

**Information Automatically Gathered About All Visitors**  
We collect aggregate and user-specific information on what pages consumers' access or visit. This information is used to generate reports that help us assess the value of and interest in the site. We use the information we collect to improve the content of our web page. We can build a better site if we know which pages our users are visiting and how often. 

Our web servers automatically collect limited information about your computer's connection to the Internet, including your IP address but not the e-mail address, when you visit our site. Your IP address does not identify you personally. We use this information to deliver our web pages to you upon request, to tailor our site to the interests of our users, and to measure traffic within our site. 

To help make our site more responsive to the needs of our visitors, we may utilize a standard feature of browser software, called a "cookie". The cookie doesn't actually identify the visitor, just the computer that a visitor uses to access our site. A cookie can't read data off your hard drive. Our advertisers or content partners may also assign their own cookies to your browser, a process that we cannot control. We use cookies to help us tailor our site to your needs, to deliver a better, more personalized service. 

**Information Shared With Other Organizations**  
We present information to our advertisers to help them understand our audience and confirm the value of advertising on our websites.  This information is usually in the form of aggregated statistics on traffic to various pages within our site. From time to time, we may share information on visitors to our site with organizations marketing products and services that we believe may be of interest to you. This list can include your e-mail address and other specific information (such as your address, phone number, personal interests, etc.) you may have provided us while online.

**Special Attention To Children**  
Children should always get permission from their parents before sending any information about themselves (such as their names, email addresses, and phone numbers) over the Internet, to us or to anyone else. We do not specifically collect information about children. We encourage parents to review and share safety tips with their children participating in the online experience. 

A final note: Our site is affiliated with other online companies, some of which feature our branding. This policy statement does not apply to those companies' web sites; please refer to these affiliated sites to obtain information on their privacy policies. If you can not find the privacy policy of any of these sites via a link from the site's homepage, you should contact the site directly for more information. 

The Web is an evolving medium. If we need to change our privacy policy at some point in the future, we'll post the changes before they take effect. Of course, our use of information gathered while the current policy is in effect will always be consistent with the current policy, even if we change that policy later.
