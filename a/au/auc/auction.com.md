**3.   COLLECTION**

The Website does not collect personally identifying information from your computer when you browse this Website and request pages from our servers.  This means that, unless you specifically and knowingly provide us with personally identifiable information, e.g., registering to create an account, we will not know your name, your email address, or any other personally identifiable information.  Information is collected through the completion of online forms, and only then will the Company collect information such as names, addresses, telephone numbers, email addresses, usernames, or other personal information.  We use this information to provide the services offered on this Website.  In addition to that, we also collect anonymized aggregate information such as pages visited, which is necessary for us to be sure that our Website functions correctly.

We may collect non-public personal information about you from the following sources:

·  Information we receive from you when you register to create an account or bid on assets.

·  Information about your transactions we secure from our files. 

Unless specifically stated otherwise in a revision of this Privacy Statement, no additional non-public personal information about you will be collected.

**User-Initiated Communication**

From time to time, portions of the website may enable you to send emails and other types of messages to us or to third parties and to participate in bulletin boards and discussion groups.  All such emails, messages, postings to bulletin boards and discussion groups become our property once you submit them.  Whenever you choose to initiate these kinds of communication with us, or anyone else, you may be contacted in return.  Also, remember that our bulletin boards and discussion groups are open to the public, and, therefore, your postings can be seen by anyone and are not protected by us or any other entity.  Please use your discretion when deciding whether and what to post and whom to contact.  We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to edit or delete postings from our bulletin boards and discussion groups.  This reservation of rights shall not under any circumstances obligate us to conduct such edits or deletions, nor shall it cause us to be liable for any such edits or deletions.

**4.   MARKETING **

On occasion, we may make information collected on the Website available to subsidiaries and affiliated companies that are part of the Auction.com family of companies.  In addition, if you download information on assets listed on our Website or place a bid on a particular asset, the seller and its affiliates and representatives are given access to your information.

  
We may also share or sell, as allowed by law, information to other companies who we believe may have products and services of interest to you.  If you would like to opt-out of receiving information from us or these other sources please follow the “Opting Out of Emails” instructions below.

We may also share information about our visitors, customers or former customers to the following types of companies that perform marketing services on our behalf or with whom we have joint marketing agreements:

·  Financial service providers such as companies engaged in banking, mortgage lending, consumer finance, securities and insurance.

·  Non-financial companies such as envelope stuffers and other fulfillment service providers. 

**5.   USE**

  
The Website uses personal information you provide to fulfill requests for services (including qualification to make bids) and to contact you.  We also use this information to better understand how visitors use our Website and how to enhance your experience, by improving the Website’s content and functionality.  We also track the last webpage visitors were on before visiting our Website, also known as a “referer” or “referring website,” and use that data to formulate statistical models. 

**6.   OUR DISCLOSURE OF YOUR INFORMATION**

If required by law, we may provide any information we have about you to law enforcement or other government agencies pursuant to a subpoena, warrant, or other order by a court of competent jurisdiction.  In all cases, we will require written documentation of the request, proof of the identity of the law enforcement official making the request, and we will take steps to authenticate the validity of the request.  Any law enforcement or government agency request submitted with less than a court-issued order will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis according to the need and urgency, as well as the particular law enforcement agency making the request.

**7.   COOKIES **

This Website uses “cookie” technology.  “Cookies” are small files that a website stores on a user’s computer.  This Website uses cookies to keep the information you enter on multiple pages together.  A majority of cookies we use are “session” cookies, meaning that they are automatically deleted from your hard drive after you close your browser at the end of your session.  Session cookies are used to optimize performance of the website and to limit the amount of redundant data that is downloaded by your computer during a single session.  We also use “persistent” cookies, which remain on your computer unless deleted by you (or by your browser settings).  We use persistent cookies for statistical analysis of performance to ensure the ongoing quality of our services.  In either case, we do not use cookies to obtain or retain any transaction details or any personally identifiable information about you apart from what you voluntarily provide us.  You may set your browser to block cookies (consult the instructions for your particular browser on how to do this), although doing so may interfere with your ability to perform certain transactions, use certain functionality, and access certain content on our Website.

**8.   OPTING OUT OF EMAILS**

  
In order to receive email newsletters and other email communications, users must voluntarily sign up for the service on our website. From time to time, however, we may send you email notices or Website update news alerting you to new features, products, promotions, or services pertaining to the Website.  If you no longer wish to receive materials from us, you may opt out of receiving these communications by choosing a “Do Not Contact” option or by contacting us at privacy@auction.com.  We will gladly comply with all requests for removal.

Additionally, in compliance with the CAN-SPAM Act of 2003, each email transmitted by the Website contains instructions for opting out of future emails.  Such instructions may include, without limitation: (a) clicking a link on the email which sends a reply to the sender’s server indicating the sender’s desire to opt out of future emails, or (b) instructions for mailing a written request to be removed from future emails.  All requests to opt out of future emails will be respected.

**9.   SECURITY AND ACCOUNT PROTECTION **

  
We treat the information you provide to us as confidential information.  Accordingly, we follow our Company security policies and procedures regarding the protection and use of confidential information.  When we ask you for sensitive data, it is transferred over a Secured Sockets Layer (SSL) line provided you are using a SSL-enabled browser such as Internet Explorer, Safari, or Firefox.  We also use SSL on other select pages where you enter personally identifiable information.  This ensures that your information is encrypted as it travels over the Internet.  This secure mode is enabled before any such information is transmitted from your computer.  You will know you are in secure mode when the padlock or key icon in the address bar of your browser appears in the locked position.  In addition, when accessing a secure server, the first characters of the Website address will change from “http” to “https.”

  
After information reaches the Website, it is stored on a secure server that resides behind firewalls designed to block unauthorized outside access.  If you are interested in learning more about our security measures, please contact us at the address below.

We appreciate your help in safeguarding the integrity of your own and others’ privacy.  We encourage you to let us know immediately if you suspect that any personal information you shared with us is being used contrary to this Privacy Policy.  While we strive to protect personal information, as outlined in this Privacy Policy, we cannot promise, guarantee, or warrant the complete security of information. 

  
**Protecting Children’s Information**

We believe it is important to provide added protection for children online.  We encourage parents and guardians to spend time online with their children to observe, participate in, and/or monitor and guide their online activity.  The Company does not knowingly collect any personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13.  If a parent or guardian believes that the Company has in its database the personally identifiable information of a child under the age of 13, please contact us immediately at [**privacy@auction.com**](mailto:privacy@auction.com) **** and we will use our best efforts to promptly remove such information from our records.

**10.   ACCESSING, REVIEWING, AND CHANGING PERSONAL INFORMATION **

  
The Company will take reasonable steps to ensure that the information and data on the Website is complete and accurate,.  If your personally identifiable information (e.g., phone number or email address) changes, is inaccurate, or if you no longer wish to use our services, contact the Company to correct or update the information.

**11.   THIRD PARTIES **

  
The Website may contain links to third-party websites for your convenience and information.  If you access those links, you will leave this Website.  Please be aware that we are not responsible for the content or privacy practices of other websites to which we link.  We do not endorse or make any representations about third-party websites.  You should also be aware that, when you voluntarily disclose personal information in public forums, such information may be collected by others and may result in receiving unsolicited messages.  The personal data you choose to provide to or that is collected by these third parties is not covered by our Privacy Statement.  We strongly encourage that when you leave our Website you should read the privacy statements of each website that collects personally identifiable information.

We may also provide social media features that enable you to share information with your social networks and to interact with Auction.com on various social media sites.  Your use of these features may result in the collection or sharing of information about you, depending on the feature.  We encourage you to review the privacy policies and settings on the social media sites with which you interact and make sure you understand the information that may be collected, used, and shared by those sites.

**12.   GENERAL **

  
**Amendments to Policy**

  
We may amend this Privacy Statement at any time by posting the amended terms on this Website.  All changes will be made here so that you will always know what information we gather, how we might use that information, and whether we may share it with anyone.  Any changes to this Statement will become effective when we post a revised Statement on the Website.  Your use of the Website following these changes means that you accept such revisions, if any.
