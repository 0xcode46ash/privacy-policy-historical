### Privacy Policy (as of 04.2014)

We want you to feel secure when visiting our websites, viewing our Online Shop and during all bidding and purchasing processes and their handling, when you engage Auctionata to prepare an appraisal as well as when you consign items (commission based transaction). That is why we adhere to the statutory provisions of the German Data Protection Act and the German Telemedia Act.

They include, for example, information such as your first and last name, address, telephone number or your birthday. They also comprise user data for example the password chosen and used by you to log into your account and to edit your profile.

This Privacy Policy supplements the Terms and Conditions of Auctionata and has to be accepted by the clients of Auctionata, who wish to buy or auction items. It also applies for clients who wish to have an appraisal or enter into a commission-based transaction with Auctionata.

If you agree to this Privacy Policy you also consent to the collection and processing of your personal data for the purposes set out below and in our Terms and Conditions.

**1\. Responsible party in terms of the German Data Protection Act**

**2\. Collection, processing and use of your personal data**

If you visit our website and do not create a profile, then we do not know who you are.

We collect, store and process your data for the following purposes:

  * in order to establish, realize and conduct the contractual relationship with you; 
  * to facilitate the provision and your use of our website and to provide the services offered on our website; 
  * to analyze, adapt and improve our services, content and advertisements. 



This comprises in particular the realization of:

  * buying, selling, auctioning and appraisal processes; 
  * shopping cart functionality; 
  * “tell a friend” functionality, where you can send an e-mail to a recipient and disclose your own e-mail address to the recipient. 



While using our website you may receive e-mail notifications from time to time, for example confirmation of transactions, information regarding the handling and conduct of purchases, sales or other transactions, invitations to provide customer feedback, notification services (if you have activated notification services in you user account) or upon cancellation of purchases to resume the purchase process at a later time. If you register for our newsletter, your e-mail will also be used to provide you with Auctionata marketing material and advertisements until you unsubscribe. You can unsubscribe at any time.

Your personal data will only be passed on to third parties or otherwise disclosed if this is necessary for the purpose of conducting the agreement or for billing, or if you have given prior consent to do so. For example, transport companies, banks, payment service providers, web hosting companies, valuation experts, auctioneers and other service providers (e.g. web analysis or technical service providers) used by us will be provided with the information they require to conduct the agreement. The third party may only use the information provided to perform its duties. Any other use of the information by this third party will not take place and will not be permitted by us.

In the course of the commission-based transaction we will also pass on your first and last names and your address details to the consignor, i.e. the owner of the respective item, as soon as you have purchased the item (identification). The consignor is prohibited from passing on your data to third parties.

Please note that internet payment systems that may be operated from outside the EU may be offered as a means of paying for items by Auctionata. In order to process a payment, such companies store data relevant to the payment on servers that may be located outside the EU. We have no influence over this. The same applies with regard to credit card companies located outside the EU.

We collect in particular the following personal data in our contractual relationships (purchase through the web shop/purchase by auction, request for a valuation, commission-based transactions):

  * First and last name, 
  * City/country, 
  * Email address, 
  * Telephone number, 
  * Payment data/ Bank account, 
  * Profile Picture and Password, if an user account has been created by a client for the participation in an auction, 
  * Information regarding the respective items or goods. 



**3\. Provision of personal data when purchasing items at auction and through the online shop**

Auctionata wishes to protect your privacy when bidding and purchasing.

If you participate in an auction by entering the auction room on the www.auctionata.com website after logging in to your user account, your profile will appear with your selected photo and your first name. You can, of course, enter your middle name or an abbreviation instead of your first name. Apart from this you will remain anonymous.

During an auction, the auctioneer may refer to the bidder by his or her first name or by referring to the bidder’s profile photo and location or by referring to his or her membership/ customer number. The auctioneer may say, for example: “The beautiful rose (profile photo) by the name of Anna (first name) from Berlin (location) has just bid 500 euros.”

When shopping in our Online Shop, third parties can´t see which items you have bought.

**4\. Cookies, Web Beacons and similar technologies**

To enhance your experience on our website and to facilitate the use of certain functions, we use cookies, web beacons or similar technologies on various pages.

Some of the cookies we use are deleted again at the end of the browser session, i.e. when you close your browser (session cookies). Other cookies remain on your computer and allow us or our partner companies to recognize your browser again when you next visit our website (persistent cookies). You can set up your browser in such a way that you are informed about the use of cookies and can choose to accept them on an individual basis, or can choose to accept cookies only in certain cases or generally reject them. The functionality of our website may be restricted, should you choose not to accept cookies.

Web beacons are small graphic files (“pixels”) embedded in our websites. Web beacons can be used to track the website usage. Similar technologies are for examples Flash cookies, HTML5 cookies or other technologies to locally store data in your browser or on your device (similar to cookies), in order to recognize your browser or device upon your next visit on our website or during a browser session.

We use so-called “social plugins” on our website by the following social media providers:

  * Facebook-Like“ by Facebook Inc., 1601 S. California Ave, Palo Alto, CA 94304, United States 
  * „Twitter” by Twitter, Inc., 795 Folsom St., Suite 600, San Francisco, CA 94107, United States 



Social plugins are software modules developed by the social media providers. We have included these social plugins in our website. Social plugins make a direct connection via your browser to the respective social media provider’s server. The social media provider receives the information that you have visited the web page where the respective social plugin is included. If you are registered and logged in to the respective social media provider’s service, the provider may correlate your user profile (e.g. your Facebook account) with your visit of our web page and your further interaction with the social plugin (e.g. click on the “Like” button). If you are not registered or logged in to the respective social media provider’s service, the provider may store your IP address.

To protect you against such data transfer to social media providers we have implemented technical protection measures (“2 click solution”). This two step solution allows you to agree to the use of a social plugin before any data is transferred to a social media provider. The agreement can be on a case-by-case basis or permanently. A permanent agreement can be revoked. If you do not want to transfer data to social media providers related to our website, do not activate the respective social plugin by clicking on it.
