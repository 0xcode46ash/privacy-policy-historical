What information do we collect?   
When you become a member of AuctionStealer, we ask you to provide us with general information so we can identify you. This information includes your first name, last name, email address, auction usernames, auction passwords and address information. Your username and password are required so that we can place bids for you. Without all the information above we would not be able to place bids on auction sites for you. 

Some other information is collected from the bids that are placed. None of this data is tied directly back to you or your account. 

What is done with this information?   
AuctionStealer will never sell or give any of your information to any third parties. You will occasionally receive email from us to keep you updated about new features and other information which will help you win more auctions. Your auction username and passwords are stored in our database and can only be changed by you once you have logged into AuctionStealer. Your auction username and password are submitted to the auction site when we place a bid for you. 

Again - your personal information is never provided to any third party. 

Is my information secure?   
Your personal information is protected by your Login Username and Password. Please make sure that you keep this information in a safe place and never share it with anyone. AuctionStealer will sometime request your Login Username but we will never ask you for your Password. To ensure the safety of your information we have taken all neccessary steps to protect your data. However, auction pages are not encrypted, and therefore when you or AuctionStealer places a bid, your Auction Username and Password is sent over the internet without encryption. For this reason we can not guarantee 100% protection of your password when a bid is placed.
