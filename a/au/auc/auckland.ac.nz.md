**Official Information Act 1982**

* * *

The University of Auckland is subject to the provisions of the Official Information Act 1982.

Official Information in relation to the University includes only information held by—

(i) The Council of the University; or

(ii) The Senate, Academic Board, or Professorial Board of the University; or

(iii) Any member of the academic staff of the University; or

(iv) Any other officer or employee of the University; or

(v) Any examiner, assessor, or moderator in any subject or examination taught or conducted by the University;

Official Information does not include:

  * personal information about the person making the request. Requests for personal information should be made under the Privacy Act 1993
  * information contained in the University Library or museum material made or acquired and preserved solely for reference or exhibition purposes;
  * information which would have to be created in order to respond to a request



Requests for official information under the Act should be directed to the Registrar, Office of the Vice-Chancellor, Private Bag, 92 019 Auckland.

The request should be as specific as possible about the information at issue. It is preferable to put requests in writing.

Under the Act the University has 20 working days to reply, although that time limit can be extended in certain circumstances specified in the Act. In such cases the requester will be advised of the extension and the reasons for it. Requesters can ask that requests be treated as urgent, but must give reasons.

The University is entitled to withhold information if, for example, the release would be likely to prejudice:

  * the national security or defence of New Zealand;
  * the maintenance of the law



Other reasons for withholding information include:

  * the commercial position of the supplier or the subject of the information;
  * the confidentiality of advice tendered by Ministers and officials;
  * the free and frank expression of opinions by or between or to Ministers and officials;
  * legal professional privilege;
  * the commercial activities of the University;
  * the privacy of natural persons, including deceased natural persons



Before withholding information for any for these reasons, consideration must be given to whether there are any other public interest considerations which outweigh the need to withhold.

Under the Act the University may make a reasonable charge for providing "official information". Generally, the first hour of time spent processing a request and the first 20 pages of photocopying are free.

You should familiarise yourself with the Act if you wish to make a request for official information. If you make any request for official information that concerns a third party the University may give notice of your request to the third party.
