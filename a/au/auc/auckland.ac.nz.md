# Privacy - The University of Auckland

We collect and process personal information about prospective and current students for the primary purposes of considering applications for admission to the University, enrolling successful applicants and administering programmes of study.

Our lawful bases for collecting and processing personal information in these ways are to meet our **obligations to students** as their tertiary education provider and to meet our **legitimate interests** , including making sure our services are fit-for-purpose and are delivered in a way that meets New Zealand’s educational standards and keeps our students and staff safe.

### The information we collect about students

We may collect personal information when you provide it to us directly – for example during the pre-application, application and enrolment processes – from third parties (usually with your consent) – for example where we need to verify previous study at other institutions – or when you generate personal information by using our services – for example when you check out a book from the General Library.

If you choose not to provide any of the personal information requested, it may not be possible for the University to consider you for admission, enrol you, or properly deliver the services you have requested from us.

The personal information we collect about you as a student will include:

  * Biographical details (including name, former name, alias, gender and date of birth)
  * Contact details (including address, telephone, email, and emergency and alternative contact details)
  * Education record and academic/research history
  * Citizenship or residency information
  * Country of origin and ethnicity
  * Iwi affiliation (if you are a Māori student)
  * National Student Number
  * National Health Index
  * Interactions and communications with us and our systems
  * Information about your study, including your academic achievement and any research or other assignments you complete
  * Feedback on courses you provide to us as part of a survey
  * Information about your suspension from any other New Zealand tertiary education provider
  * Photograph (for student ID cards)
  * Other information that you decide to share with us



In addition, depending on your programme of study or involvement with specific services that we offer, we may also collect:

  * Information about your areas of study interest
  * Passport and visa details
  * Information about your English language proficiency
  * Health and disability information (including where you use student health, counselling, disability, accommodation, or recreation services, or where you have applied for a field trip, student exchange or study abroad programme)
  * Career information (including your aspirations and relevant work history/experience)
  * Financial information (including information about payment for study, such as credit/debit card or bank account details)
  * Criminal convictions (if necessary for certain programmes or work placements)
  * Information provided through reference checking processes for accommodation or other benefits
  * Health and travel insurance arrangements (including where you are an international student, or you are participating in field trips or student exchanges), and
  * Information about your child provided by you to our Early Childhood Centres (if you have enrolled your child in one of these Centres)



We may also collect personal information about you as you use our services and participate in campus life. For example, we may audio and/or video record the lectures you attend (your lecturer will usually advise you of this beforehand). Where CCTV cameras are in use at a University campus, we may collect still or video footage of your activities for safety and security purposes. We also use sensors on many University desks to assist us to operate sustainably (the sensors tell us if a desk is occupied, so we can allocate resources efficiently and manage lighting and heating requirements), however the data collected from these sensors will not identify you unless you are using an assigned desk.

### How we use your information

In order to meet the primary purposes set out above, we will use your personal information in the ways set out below. We will generally only use personal information in these ways. Where we need to use information in a way we have not anticipated here, we will only do so if required or permitted by law.

We will use your personal information to:

We may also use automated tools to assist us with the marking of multiple choice assessments. In most cases where we use automated processing as part of our admissions or course administration processes, the outcomes are reviewed by our employees.
