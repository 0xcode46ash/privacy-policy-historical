The customer's contact information is used to contact the visitor when necessary. 

We keep your email address and send you information only if you have given us permission to send you mailings. You may opt-out of receiving future mailings; see the choice/opt-out section below. Unique identifiers (such as social security numbers) are collected to verify the user's identity and for use as account numbers in our record system. 

This site will not share user information or email addresses with third parties for marketing purposes unless the user has indicated that he/she wants to get marketing or promotional notices. 

**Security:** This site has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. 

**Choice/Opt-Out & Correct/Update:** Our site provides users the opportunity to opt-out of receiving communications from us and our partners at the point where we request information about the visitor.
