# Privacy Policy | Auvik Networks

### Privacy Policy

This document is designed to disclose the Privacy Policy of Auvik Networks Inc. (“Auvik”, “we” or “us”). This Privacy Policy applies to our website, www.auvik.com, and its related subdomains (herein referred to as the “Site”) as well as the services provided by Auvik.

### Collection of Personally Identifiable Information

The amount of personally identifiable information provided by the user and collected by Auvik depends on the nature of the interaction. For a user requesting to be included on Auvik’s mailing list, the user must provide their email address. Users requesting an account in order to use our services on either a trial or ongoing basis will be asked to provide their full name and email as well as more information such as address, phone number, and company information.

Once a user has provided Auvik with their personally identifiable information, their browsing history within the Site will be associated with that information.

If a user provides personally identifiable information relating to other people, that user represents that he/she has the authority to do so and to permit us to use the information provided in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

### Use of Cookies

Auvik uses cookies, which are small data files that are saved to a user’s computer when they visit our Site. Auvik may use both “session” cookies and “persistent” cookies. A session cookie is only active while the user is on the website and is deleted once they close their browser. Unlike a session cookie, a persistent cookie is not deleted when a user closes their browser and will it stay on their computer indefinitely. Auvik uses cookies to identify returning users, save login information (but never passwords), track usage statistics and store user preferences. By default, most browsers will automatically accept cookies but by altering their browser’s settings, a user can either disable cookies completely or be prompted prior to a cookie being loaded. Consult each individual browser’s “help” feature for more information on how these actions can be done.

### Google Analytics

This Site uses Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. (“Google”) that uses cookies to analyze how users use the site. The information collected by Google about a user’s website usage will be transmitted and stored by Google on servers housed in the United States. This information will remain non-personally identifiable information and will not be associated with other information that Google has about a user. Google will use the gathered information to provide Auvik with detailed reports and statistics about our Site’s usage in order for us to further understand our customers and improve our services. Google may transfer this information to third parties when required to do so by law or where such third parties process the information on Google’s behalf. As Google Analytics relies on cookies to perform its service, a user not wanting their usage data to be collected can avoid it by disabling cookies in their browser.

### Google Display Advertising

This Site also uses Google Display Advertising. Google Display Advertising lets us enable features in Google Analytics that aren’t available through the standard implementation. These additional features enable Auvik to enable Retargeting with Google Analytics, Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting, Google Display Network Impression Reporting and the DoubleClick Campaign Manager integration.

Implementing Retargeting with Google Analytics means that third-party vendors, including Google, may show our ads on sites across the Internet. Auvik and third-party vendors, including Google, use first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookie) and third-party cookies (such as the DoubleClick cookie) together to inform, optimize, and serve ads based on someone’s past visits to our Site.

Implementing Google Display Network Impression Reporting and the DoubleClick Campaign Manager means that Auvik and third-party vendors, including Google, use first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookie) and third-party cookies (such as the DoubleClick cookie) together to report how our ad impressions, other uses of ad services, and interactions with these ad impressions and ad services are related to visits to our Site.

The data we gather from Google’s Interest-based advertising or third-party audience data (such as age, gender, and interests) through Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting will be used to better understand the demographic to which our services appeal so that we can display our ads to those who would benefit from our services and not to those who would not benefit.

If a user would like to opt-out of Google Analytics for Display Advertising and customize Google Display Network ads, they can do so by going to [www.google.com/settings/ads](http://www.google.com/settings/ads "Google Ads Settings").

### Your Information with Regard to Third Parties

Auvik does not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your personally identifiable information. This statement does not include trusted third party service providers who assist us in administering and providing our services or provide services to us. We may also release your information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law, enforce our site policies, or protect ours or others rights, property or safety. However, we may provide non-personably identifiable visitor information to other parties for marketing, advertising or other uses.

Information that we collect from our users, including personally identifiable information, is considered to be a business asset. As a result, if we go out of business or enter bankruptcy or if we are acquired as a result of a transaction such as a merger, acquisition or asset sale, your personally identifiable information may be disclosed or transferred to the third-party acquirer in connection with the transaction.

### Links to Third Party

Auvik may at times provide a link to a third party website or service. This Privacy Policy only addresses the use and disclosure of information collected from the use of our Site and services. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of third parties or the content of linked sites and you should refer to the Privacy Policies of third parties if you have any questions.

### How We Protect Your Privacy

Auvik uses reasonable security measures to safeguard information concerning, or submitted by, our users. However, no information transmitted over the internet or stored electronically is one hundred percent secure.

### Opt-out

A user who has been receiving emails from Auvik and wishes to opt-out can do so via the “Manage Subscription” link at the bottom of all Auvik emails.

### Changes to Our Privacy Policy

Auvik reserves the right to make changes to our Privacy Policy. As such, we encourage all users to review this Privacy Policy regularly to stay up-to-date on our policies. In such a case, we will update the effective date of the updated policy.

This version of the Privacy Policy is effective as of February 7th, 2014.
