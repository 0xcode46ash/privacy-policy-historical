# AuriQ Systems, Inc. - Privacy Statement

| 

**Your privacy matters to us.**  
AuriQ Systems envisions the Internet as a safe place where people can exchange ideas and information. We believe that safety on the Internet is a right and not a privilege.

AuriQ Systems believes strongly in a “Permission-based” Internet, where information is gathered and used only with the strict consent of the individual. All of AuriQ technologies and websites adhere to this core principle to ensure the protection of individual privacy.

AuriQ Systems, Inc. is dedicated to protecting the privacy of online users and follows the guidelines set forth by the Internet Advertising Bureau (IAB). This privacy statement discloses the privacy practices for AuriQ Systems, Inc. and is designed to protect information that can be associated with an individual (Personal Identifiable Information) in an online environment.

**The Technology**   
  
  |  Our Technology heavily stresses Permission-based information gathering. AuriQ requires the user’s consent before accepting any submitted demographical information or surfing pattern data. We do not use "cookies", nor do we require users to do so. We do not use "Internet tags", nor do we require users to do so. The information we obtain from our users can never be linked to any Personal Identifiable Information and maintains users’ anonymity.

 From time-to-time we request information from users via surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information. Information requested may include demographic information (such as zip code, age level). Contact information will be used to notify the winners and award prizes. Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of their Internet experience.

** Our Website** |  AuriQ Systems is the sole owner of the information collected on this site. We will not sell, share, or rent this information to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement. AuriQ may collect information from our users when they choose to register or order on our website. During registration or ordering, a user is required to give their contact information (such as name and email address). This information is used to contact the user about the services on our site for which they have expressed interest. It is optional for the user to provide demographic information (such as income level and gender), and unique identifiers (such as social security number), but encouraged so we can provide a more personalized experience on our site. A user just browsing through our website never surrenders any direct demographical information. Although a user’s IP address can be traced when surfing, IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information.

** A Note on  
Cookies** |  A "cookie" is a small text file that a website can place on your computer's hard drive in order, for example, to collect information about your activities on the site or to make it possible for you to use an online "shopping cart" to keep track of items you wish to purchase. The cookie transmits this information back to the Web site's computer which, generally speaking, is the only computer that can read it. Most consumers do not know that "cookies" are being placed on their computers when they visit websites. If you want to know when this happens, or to prevent it from happening, you can set your browser to warn you when a website attempts to place a "cookie" on your computer.

**A Note on Internet tags** |  An "Internet tag", also known as single pixel GIFs, clear GIFs, invisible GIFs, and 1-by-1 GIFs, are smaller than cookies and tell the website server information such as the IP address and browser type related to the visitor's computer. This site, nor our technology uses Intenet tags.

** AuriQ Partners** |  This AuriQ Site may contain links to other company sites. We have no control nor are we responsible for the terms and privacy of these sites.
