**The purpose of this statement is to set out how we use your personal information. By accessing and using AQA's Websites, or by supplying your personal information at an event, online, by email, telephone or on an application form, you agree to your personal data being processed by us in accordance with this statement, which forms part of the AQA Terms and Conditions.

  1. **Collecting personal information**   
AQA is committed to respecting and protecting your privacy. When you register with AQA for one of its services, including this Website, you will be asked to provide certain personal information, for example your name, address, email address or phone number. AQA will store this data securely and hold it on computers or otherwise, and use it for the purposes outlined below.
  2. **Use of personal information**   
AQA collects personal data for the purposes of administering examinations, ancillary support and the provision of services, administration of staff, contractors and self-employed specialists, payment validations, including taking and processing payments, and market research.

AQA only uses personal information within the context of the purposes outlined above and it will only keep the information as long as is necessary to support these purposes.

If you do not inform AQA that you do not wish to receive marketing messages from AQA then AQA may send you, from time to time, messages to keep you informed of suitable products or services. AQA will give you the opportunity of "opting out" of receiving such communications both when you give AQA your information and with each marketing message AQA may send you.

  3. **Controlling access to personal information**   
AQA will not pass on your details to any third party (other than agents working directly on our behalf) unless you give AQA permission to do so or AQA is required to do so by law.
