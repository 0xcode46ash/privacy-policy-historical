**Use of Cookies**

AlterNet employs cookies -- small text files placed on your computer's hard drive -- to track the type of content and sites to which our users link, the length of time they spend at any particular site and the AlterNet services they use. Cookies also help us diagnose problems with our server.

**Email Newsletters and "Send a Friend" Feature**

After signing up online, users will receive email newsletters and other occasional announcements from AlterNet. In order to distribute our email, we collect subscribers' email addresses. We do not share addresses with other companies or partners. Users can unsubscribe from email newsletters at any time.

AlterNet offers a "send this story to a friend" feature, which allows our users to inform others about an article they might be interested in. For this feature to function, we ask for email addresses from the sender and for the recipient. We do not store or save these addresses and you will not receive any communication from AlterNet or its partners as a result of having used this feature.

**Discussion Forums**

AlterNet makes [discussion forums](https://web.archive.org/discuss) available to its users. Please remember any information disclosed in these areas becomes publicly available, and therefore you should exercise caution when disclosing personal information.

If you have any concerns about the discussion forums, send email to [discuss@alternet.org](mailto:discuss@alternet.org).

From time to time AlterNet will conduct voluntary surveys of site visitors to obtain aggregate demographic information about them. This information may be compiled and shared in the aggregate with third parties, but no personal details will be traceable or associated with specific individuals.

**Linking to Other Sites**

AlterNet contains links to other sites. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such websites.

**Children's Guidelines**

Protecting the rights of children is important to us. As a result, we do not collect or maintain any information from individuals we know to be under 13 years old, and no part of AlterNet is intended to attract anyone under 13.
