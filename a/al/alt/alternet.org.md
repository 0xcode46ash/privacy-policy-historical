All personal information you provide will remain confidential. In addition, you will always have the option to edit the information that you have provided to us or to have your personal information removed from our records.

**Newsletters and "E-Mail to a Friend" Feature**  
After signing up online to receive an AlterNet.org newsletter, users will start receiving a newsletter and other occasional announcements from AlterNet.org. In order to distribute our newsletters, we collect subscribers' e-mail addresses. We do not share addresses with other companies or partners. Users can choose to unsubscribe from AlterNet.org newsletters at any time by following the unsubscribe instructions found in each e-mail, visiting the newsletter sign-up page or sending e-mail to [support@alternet.org](mailto:support@alternet.org). 

AlterNet.org offers an "e-mail a friend this story" feature, which allows our users to inform friends about an article they might be interested in reading. In order for this feature to function, we ask for e-mail addresses from the sender and for the recipient. We do not store or save these addresses and you will not receive any communication from AlterNet.org or its partners as a result of having used this feature. 

**Message Boards**  
AlterNet.org makes message boards available to its users. Please remember that any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes publicly available and you should therefore exercise caution when disclosing personal information. 

You may either sign up to use the message boards or post anonymously. If you choose to sign up, you will need to provide a password and your e-mail address. You may also include an alias e-mail address, name and other information. This information will be stored in a database and you will have the option to be automatically notified of messages related to your posts. You will not receive any additional communication from AlterNet.org or its partners as a result of having used this feature. 

If you have any concerns about the message boards, send e-mail to [support@alternet.org](mailto:support@alternet.org).

From time to time AlterNet.org will conduct voluntary surveys of site visitors in order to obtain aggregate demographic information about them. This information may be compiled and shared in the aggregate with third parties, but no personal details will be traceable or associated with specific individuals.
