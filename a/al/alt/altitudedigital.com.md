### About altitudedigitalpartners.com and Consumers

Altitude Digital Partners is not in the business of collecting, using, or selling consumer data; however it does offer tools and technologies to advertisers and publishers that allow them to collect and use user data. This is done primarily to enable these buyers and sellers of online video-advertising space to try and ensure that the audience they desire sees their ads and that the advertising itself is delivered and the performance of the advertising can be analyzed. Types of data that may be used for this purpose range from behavioral or interest-related information to geographical or demographical user data.

### Information Collected, and How It Is Collected

Personally-Identifiable Information. altitudedigitalpartners.com does not collect personally-identifiable information in order to help our clients buy, sell, and deliver online video advertising. "Personally-Identifiable Information" means information that alone or when in combination with other information that Altitude Digital Partners.com collects may be used to readily identify, contact, or locate you. There may be some opportunities, for example when you use this Site, where you may choose to enter your name, contact information, and other personal details. For example, if you were interested in becoming one of our clients or using our Services you could provide us with contact details through our Site.

Where we collect personally-identifiable information you will have clear notification of what we are doing so that you can choose not to provide it.

Non-Personally-Identifiable Information.

### Security Precautions
