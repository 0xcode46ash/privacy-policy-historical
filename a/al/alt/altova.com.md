# Altova Privacy Policy

Welcome to Altova. 

Altova is committed to protecting your privacy in connection with Personal Information, hereinafter defined, received from you. Altova’s practices concerning the collection and use of personal information on the altova.com Web site, the shop.altova.com Web site (“Altova Online Shop”), or all other Altova owned, operated, licensed or controlled site (collectively the “Site(s)”) as well as personal information collected by Altova via alternate business channels such as telephone calls, trades shows, conferences, or from our partners, are tailored to meet this objective. Subject to the requirements of applicable law, this privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) details the privacy practices of Altova GmbH and its subsidiaries (“Altova”) in connection with your use of the Site(s) as well as Altova software products and/or services. By using the Site(s) and/or installing Altova software, you are deemed to consent to the Privacy Policy as well as the Altova Web site Terms of Use, as applicable. 

If you do not consent to the Privacy Policy and the practices outlined below, do not use the Site(s), access our services, download materials or use Altova software. Subject to applicable law, Altova revises the Privacy Policy from time to time and we encourage you to visit this page to review our current Privacy Policy because it is binding on you. All updates will be published and we will revise the “last updated” date at the bottom of the Privacy Policy. A notice will be posted on our Site whenever this Privacy Policy is changed in a material way. Subject to applicable law, your continued use of the Site(s) and/or your use of Altova software constitute your consent to the Privacy Policy as revised from time to time. We encourage you to read the complete Privacy Policy and to contact us via email or post as set forth below with any questions or comments that you have. 

In some instances you are able to browse through our Site(s) without telling us who you are or revealing information that would permit use to personally or directly identify you (“Personal Information”). Altova may collect information in a number of ways. The most common are when you are asked to register before downloading Altova software; when you request an evaluation key-code directly from within Altova software; when you request an evaluation extension; when you subscribe to e-mail newsletters; when you join a limited access part of the Site(s); when you participate in a contest, survey, or promotion; when you report a problem with our Site(s), our services or our software products; or when you purchase, activate and register Altova software products and services as applicable. Altova may also receive Personal Information about you from other business channels such as telephone calls, trade shows, conferences, product demonstrations, service engagements, or from our partners. 

Altova typically collects Personal Information such as e-mail address, name, company, organization or location but may include other information when needed to provide a product or service or as part of the purchase, activation and registration thereof. For example our order forms in the Altova Online Shop collect customers’ contact information and financial information such as credit card number and other billing information, which is used to process, fulfill and deliver your order. All of the data you enter into the order form is transmitted to the Altova Online Shop over an encrypted channel to guard your data against abuse using 128-bit SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) encryption. In order to prevent unlicensed or illegal use of Altova software, the software contains a software activation system that allows for an exchange of technical and license related data such as but not limited to operating system, IP address, date/time, software and software version, and computer name, along with other information between your computer and an Altova license server at the time of installation, registration or update, and information that is gathered periodically to facilitate the provision of software updates, product support and other services to you (if any) related to the Altova Software and to verify compliance with the terms of the EULA for the Altova software (if any). Altova collects the information submitted via the Altova Online Support Center and technical incident support form to better serve our customers. In addition, Altova collects information about its Site(s) visitors which does not necessarily identify the visitor using our server log files, cookies and web beacons as described below. 

Altova generally uses your Personal Information for purposes such as to help us create and deliver content, products, and services relevant to you; to help us personalize or enhance your experience on our Site(s); to help you find or purchase software, services or information on our Site(s); to provide you with assistance or respond to your inquires; to fulfill orders, process payments or perform credit check, as necessary; for interactive communications with you about our products or services; to relieve you from having to provide your Personal Information more than once; in order to prevent unlicensed or illegal use of Altova software; to notify you by email, telephone or other medium about product upgrades, updated information, special offers and other new services or software offerings (you will be able to unsubscribe from emails by following the instructions at the bottom of our message); to help us manage and administer our Site(s) or as otherwise described herein. 

**The information about our users and visitors that Altova collects is important to us and we do not sell it to other parties**. Except in the limited circumstance set forth below, Altova will disclose Personal Information, without notice, only if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) comply with the law, subpoena, court order or other legal process; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of Altova and its family of Web sites, and (c) protect the personal safety of users of Altova, its Site(s), or the public.

In limited instances, Altova may hire other companies to provide limited services on our behalf, answering customer questions about products or services, packaging, mailing and delivering purchases, processing purchasing transactions, and processing event registration. We will only provide those companies the information they need to deliver the service, and they are prohibited from using that information for any other purpose and they are obligated to protect your Personal Information. When you order a product or service from a company linked to our Site(s), it may be necessary for us to share certain limited information with that company in order to process and complete your purchase or other transaction. In such cases, we share the minimum information necessary to complete the transaction. This does not include selling, renting, sharing, or otherwise disclosing personally identifiable information from customers for commercial purposes in violation of commitment stated in this Privacy Policy. In the event Altova is acquired by another company, Personal Information may be part of the assets transferred to the acquiring party. Please note that Altova maintains archives of its web logs, database, and other systems and information and that it is possible some of this information may remain archived after Altova deletes the information from its active database. Altova maintains these archives for disaster recovery, legal, administrative and other non-marketing purposes. 

Altova does use other information that we collected from our server log files, cookies and web beacons to get a better understanding of our visitors and customer base in order for us to enhance our Site(s), software and services. This information collected is compiled and analyzed on an aggregate basis and does not identify you personally. **This information helps us to determine the content that provides value to our customers and visitors**.

Altova has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of your Personal Information under our control. These include a firewall to prevent unauthorized access to our systems. Inside Altova, Personal Information and customer data is stored in password-controlled servers with limited and controlled access on a need-to-know basis. While we cannot guarantee that loss, misuse or alteration to data will not occur, we take many precautions to prevent such unfortunate occurrences. However, Altova accepts no liability for any unintentional disclosure. **Except under conditions explained in the Privacy Policy, your Personal Information is never shared outside Altova**. 

Please note that the information as described herein may be transferred outside of the European Economic Area, for purposes of processing, analysis, and review, by Altova, Inc. a company located in Beverly, Massachusetts, U.S.A., or its subsidiaries or Altova’s subsidiaries or divisions, or authorized partners, located worldwide. You are advised that the United States uses a sectoral model of privacy protection that relies on a mix of legislation, governmental regulation, and self-regulation. You are further advised that the Council of the European Union has found that this model does not provide "adequate" privacy protections as contemplated by Article 25 of the European Union's Data Directive. (Directive 95/46/EC, 1995 O.J. (L 281) 31). Article 26 of the European Union's Data Directive allows for transfer of personal data from the European Union to a third country if the individual has unambiguously given his consent to the transfer of personal information, regardless of the third country's level of protection. By agreeing to this Privacy Policy, you consent to the transfer of all such information to the United States and the processing of that information as described in the applicable EULA and the Privacy Policy. 

When you register with the Site(s), you may be provided a password that will allow you to access the Site(s). You are ultimately responsible for maintaining the confidentiality and security of your Personal Information and use of your password whether or not authorized by you. You agree to immediately notify us of any unauthorized use of your password. **We recommend that you do not divulge your password to anyone. Please take care when using and storing it**.

In addition to the Personal Information that we collect when you register, we also may collect information passively using “cookies” or “Web beacons.” This helps to ensure we are publishing content customers need and want as well as enabling us to customize your experience on our Site(s). A cookie is a small text file containing a unique identification number that is transferred from a Web site to the hard drive of your computer so that the site administrator may identify your computer and passively track its activities on the site. Cookies allow us to automatically remember your Web browser, which in turn helps us deliver products and Services more efficiently, prevent others from using your account, measure statistics such as audience size and traffic patterns, and display advertisements. When someone visits the Site(s), a cookie may be placed on the user’s machine (if the user accepts cookies) or is read if the user has visited the Site(s) previously. Web beacons, also known as clear GIF technology or action tags, are small images that we may place on Web pages and within Web-based e-mail newsletters that assist in delivering the cookie. This technology tells us how many visitors clicked on key elements (such as links or graphics) on a web page on the Site(s). By modifying your browser preferences you can choose to accept all cookies, to be notified when a cookie is set, or to reject all cookies. If you choose to not have your browser accept cookies from the Site, you still will be able to view the text on the screens. However you will not experience a personalized visit nor will you be able to subscribe to or use certain offerings on the site. Web logs automatically record anything a web server sees, which may include email addresses you enter into a form or pages viewed by a user at a particular IP address. 

Our Site may contain links to other sites, including ones that display our trademarks and name amongst other organizations. Altova assumes no responsibility for the content or the privacy policies and practices of such Web sites. Altova encourages you to read the privacy statements of these linked sites; their privacy practices may differ from ours. Please remember that any information you submit in a discussion forum, message board or other such area will be deemed public information and is not confidential. There is a risk in such communication venues that information can be collected and used by others. **Please be careful and responsible when you are online**.

The Site(s) are not directed to children under the age of 13 and Altova assumes products purchased through credit card means are purchased by adults. Altova respects the privacy of parents and children and is committed to complying with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). Altova believes that parents should supervise their children's online activities and consider using parental control tools available from online services and software manufacturers that help provide a kid-friendly online environment. These tools can also prevent children from otherwise disclosing online their name, address and other Personal Information without parental permission.
