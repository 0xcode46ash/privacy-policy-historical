### The Information We Collect

Alteryx may collect personal information when you register with Alteryx and/or use Alteryx products or services. You may be required to provide us with your real name, e-mail address, phone number, and shipping address. For certain licensees, Alteryx may require additional information, such as date of birth or other verification information. Whenever you visit the Site and/or when you use our Software, Alteryx also receives and records information on our server logs from your browser, including your IP address, Alteryx cookie information, and the pages you request, as well as usage data related to Alteryx software; and relates such information to the PII you provide.

### How We Use Your Personal Information

We may use PII to (a) fulfill your requests for products and services, (b) improve our products and services, (c) contact you to conduct research, (d) provide anonymous reporting for internal and external clients, and/or (e) offer products and/or services to you. Once you have registered or have purchased Alteryx products or services, we reserve the right to send you certain communications relating to the Alteryx service that are considered part of your Alteryx account. You may opt out of receiving communications from us upon a receipt of an email from us after you register on our site or upon installation of software.

We also use PII for internal and product/service-related purposes only. We do not rent, sell, or share PII about you with third parties or nonaffiliated companies, except with your permission (a) to provide products or services you have requested and (b) to our partners who may provide you with information regarding certain products and services in connection with your use of the Alteryx products or services, and who are under confidentiality obligations. These companies may use your PII to help Alteryx communicate with you about offers from Alteryx and our marketing partners. However, these companies do not have any other independent right to use or share this information. If you do not want your name and contact information to be shared with any company or organization, you may notify us at any time by clicking here: [Unsubscribe](http://pages.alteryx.com/UnsubscribePage.html). Credit card information is used only for payment processing and fraud prevention. Credit card information and other sensitive personal information required to process a purchase is not used for any other purpose by our financial services providers or us.

We may disclose PII in response to legal process in response to a court order or a subpoena. We also may disclose PII in response to a law enforcement agency's request or where we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of our Terms of Service or [End User License Agreements (EULA)](https://web.archive.org/end-user-license-agreement) to verify or enforce compliance with the policies governing our products and applicable laws, or as otherwise required or permitted by law or consistent with legal requirements. In addition, we may transfer PII about you if we are acquired by, sold to, or merged with another company. We reserve the right to assign and/or transfer all PII in our system in the event that Alteryx is sold to or merged with another party.

### What Cookies and Web Beacons Are and How We Use Them

Our Site uses "cookies," which are small text files that we place in visitors' computer browsers to store their preferences. Cookies themselves do not contain any PII. "Web beacons" are small pieces of code placed on a web page to monitor the behavior and collect data about the visitors viewing a web page. For example, web beacons can be used to count the users who visit a web page or to deliver a cookie to the browser of a visitor viewing that page. We may use web beacons on our Site from time to time for this purpose. We may also use a "phone-home" technology to gather data for the purpose of improving our products and marketing products and services to you.

### Internet Protocol Addresses

An Internet protocol ("IP") address is the unique number assigned to your server or Internet Service Provider ("ISP"). Alteryx may track such IP addresses for system administration, usage information, to report aggregate information, site tracking, or to prevent our servers from being abused.

### Do Not Track Option

Various internet browsers offer a "do not track" or "DNT" option that relies on a technology known as a DNT header that sends a signal to Websites' visited by the user about the user's browser DNT preference setting. Alteryx does not currently respond to browsers' DNT signals with respect to the Site, in part, because no common industry standard for DNT has been adopted by industry groups, technology companies or regulators. Alteryx takes privacy seriously and will continue to make efforts to monitor developments around DNT browser technology and the implementation of a standard.

We may use AdRoll's services to offer you Alteryx products and services. You may opt-out of AdRoll cookies at the NAI opt-out tool at [www.networkadvertising.org/choices](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices) or via the DAA website at <http://www.aboutads.info/choices>.

### Collection of Information by Third-Party Sites and Sponsors

Our Site contains links to other Web sites, including those of our partners and sponsors, whose information practices may be different from ours. Sometimes these third party websites may conduct contests or sweepstakes that are promoted on our Site and you may be directed away from our Site in order to participate in such contests or sweepstakes. In such case, you should consult these third party websites' privacy notices.

### How We Secure Your Information

We have taken steps to assure that all information collected will remain secure and in its original form. As such, access to all personal information is strictly controlled. We have established appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures in an effort to safeguard and help prevent unauthorized access, maintain data security, and correctly use the information we collect online.

To verify the security of your PC's web connection at our Service, check the lower left corner of your browser window after accessing the server. If you see an unbroken or a closed lock, then SSL is active and the server is secure. You may also check by looking at the URL line of your browser. When accessing a secure server, the Site address will change from "http" to "https".

### Use of Our Online Forums

We may provide blogs, bulletin boards, forums or chat rooms ("Forum") on the Site. Any personal information you submit in a Forum may be read, collected or used by other users who visit the Forum. Alteryx is not responsible for any use or disclosure of the PII in your posts or during any other communication with other site users. You must evaluate, and bear the risk associated with, the accuracy, completeness or usefulness of a Forum. We do not pre-screen postings in such Forum and reserve the right to remove any content posted.

### How to Correct or Review Your Personal Information

Upon request and subject to identity verification, we will provide you with access to identifying information that we have collected about you. We offer you the ability to have inaccuracies corrected regarding your contact information. This information and any corrections can be requested by sending us an e-mail through the e-mail link provided above or writing to us at the above address.

### How We Update our Privacy Policy

From time to time, we may use PII for new, unanticipated uses not previously disclosed in our Privacy Policy. In such event, we will post any the changes to our policy on this website without prior notice to you.

### How to Contact Us
