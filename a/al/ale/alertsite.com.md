Applicability of Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy is intended to apply to [www.AlertSite.com](http://www.alertsite.com/).

Personally Identifiable Information

However, AlertSite uses a subscription form for you to request services. In connection with this subscription form, AlertSite collects your contact information, such as name, address and phone number, e-mail address and financial information, such as account or credit card numbers. Information collected from the subscription form is used to send orders, billing materials, and information about AlertSite. This information is also used to contact you when necessary in connection with our services. Financial information that is collected is used strictly for internal purposes only. AlertSite will not disclose, sell or give rights to any personally identifiable information from you to any third-party in ways other than disclosed in this policy.

Changes to this Privacy Policy

If we decide to change our Privacy Policy, we will post those changes to this Privacy Policy, the homepage, and other places we deem appropriate so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. AlertSite reserves the right to modify this Privacy Statement at any time, so please review it frequently. If we make any material changes to this policy, we will notify you here, by email, or by means of a notice on our homepage.

Choice/Opt-out (Evaluation Period)

AlertSite sends weekly promotional communications to users who have signed up for our 30-day trial evaluation during the evaluation period that contain the users monitoring results to date and additional information regarding AlertSite's products and services. At the end of the 30-day evaluation period, two follow up promotional emails strictly containing information about AlertSite's products and services are sent (one the week after the 30-day expiration and the second thirty days later). Consequently, these communications will end no later than sixty days following the beginning of the evaluation. 

In addition to the evaluation period communications, users also receive an order confirmation email along with a security verification email immediately following registration. 

Users are not given the choice to opt-out of receiving the communications described above since they are requirements of registering for a free evaluation of our services. 

Choice/Opt-out (Other)

Our users are given the opportunity to opt-out of having their information used for purposes not directly related to our site at the point where we ask for information. For example, our order form has an opt-out mechanism so users who buy a service from us, but don't want any marketing material such as information about upgrades, discounts or special promotions, can keep their email address off of our lists. For any non-service related communications or information uses, our opt-out mechanism defaults to the opted-in status until users explicitly opt-out for the first time. 

Users who no longer wish to receive our newsletter and promotional communications may opt-out of receiving these communications by emailing us at [customercare@alertsite.com](mailto:customercare@alertsite.com) or by contacting us by telephone or postal mail at the contact listed below. 

Access to Personally Identifiable Information

A user may access their personally identifiable information through a secure login provided on our web site. 

If your personally identifiable information changes, you may correct or update it by making the change directly through your manage account control panel. If you should no longer desire our services, you may delete or deactivate your personally identifiable information by emailing our Customer Support at [support@alertsite.com](mailto:support@alertsite.com) or by contacting us by telephone or postal mail at the contact listed below. 

Customer Forum

If you use the customer forum on this site, you should be aware that any personally identifiable information you submit there can be read, collected, or used by other users of this forum, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages. We are not responsible for the personally identifiable information you choose to submit in this forum.
