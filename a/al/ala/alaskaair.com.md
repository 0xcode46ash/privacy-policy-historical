This Privacy Notice describes the types of personal information we collect on the Sites and through the fingerprint identity verification service, how we may use that information and with whom we may share it. The Privacy Notice also describes the measures we take to protect the security of the personal information. We also tell you how you can reach us to ask us to update your preferences regarding how we communicate with you or answer any questions you may have about our privacy practices.

### Information We Collect

#### Information You Provide Directly to Us

When you visit the Sites, you may provide personal information directly to us, including:

  * Contact information, such as name, postal address, telephone number, and email address 
  * Travel information, such as flight, hotel and vehicle reservation information 
  * Certain categories of special needs (such as wheelchair use) 
  * Birth date and gender 
  * Transportation Security Administration (TSA) Redress Number 
  * Payment information, such as credit card number and expiration date 
  * Gift card and travel certificate information, such as card code, PIN number, and e-ticket number 
  * Confirmation code, and e-ticket number, Mileage Plan™ number and other awards or loyalty program numbers 
  * The location of the device on which you install our app
  * Information provided to us by Facebook when you use the Facebook-related functionality of our apps, including (depending on the app) your name, profile picture, gender, networks, user ID, hometown and location, list of friends (including their photos), and friends' hometowns and locations (but please note that the Facebook login information you enter in our apps to activate the Facebook functionality is collected directly by Facebook, and we do not have access to this information) 
  * Information about your education, work and military history, citizenship or legal work eligibility status, and other information relevant to specific jobs for which you wish to apply, such as whether you are at least 18 years of age.



At an expanding number of locations, we offer a fingerprint identity verification service, allowing you to use your fingerprint for things like flight check-in, baggage drop, flight boarding, and accessing our Board Room airport lounge. Participation is completely optional. If you choose to enroll, our system will scan your fingerprint, take certain measurements of it, and convert these measurements into an identifying number. We delete the initial image but retain the identifying number based on the measurements. We can’t work backwards from this information to reproduce an image of your fingerprint, but the next time you scan your fingerprint, we’ll repeat the measurement process and compare the identifying number to confirm your identity, without the need to swipe a card or examine an ID. You can opt out at any time as described in the Your Choices section below.

#### Information We Collect by Automated Means

When you visit our Sites, we may collect certain information by automated means, using technologies such as cookies, Web server logs and Web beacons.

Cookies are small files that websites send to your computer or other Internet-connected device to uniquely identify your browser or to store information or settings in your browser. Your browser may tell you how to be notified when you receive certain types of cookies and how to restrict or disable certain cookies. Please note, however, that without cookies you may not be able to use all of the features of our Sites.

Our Web servers may log information such as your device and operating system type, browser type, domain, device ID, and other system settings, as well as the language your system uses and the country and time zone where your device is located. The Web server logs also may record information such as the address of the Web page that referred you to our Site and the IP address of the device you use to connect to the Internet in order for us deliver a customized website experience based on your geographic area.

To control which Web servers collect information by automated means, we may place tags on our Web pages called "Web beacons", which are small files that allow us to understand the actions of visitors to our Sites, and we use similar technology to analyze users' interactions with our apps.

We use third-party Web analytics services on our Sites, such as those of Omniture and Google Analytics. These service providers use cookies and Web beacons or other technology to help us analyze how users use the Sites. The information collected by such technology (including, where applicable, your IP address) will be disclosed to or collected directly by these service providers, who use the information to facilitate the evaluation of your use of the Sites. [Learn more about Omniture's services](http://www.omniture.com/en/privacy/product), including your opt-out options for the Omniture tools on our websites. [Learn about Google Analytics and how to opt out.](http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout)

If your device configuration allows it, our apps may also automatically collect information about the location of your device, using technologies such as GPS, WiFi, and Bluetooth signals. This data may be used for purposes such as providing location-based products, services, or offers, and as further described in the “How We Use the Information We Collect” section below.

#### Interest Based Advertising

On our websites, information may be collected about your online activities for use in providing you with advertising about products and services tailored to your individual interests. This section of our Privacy Notice provides details and explains how to exercise your choices.

You may see certain ads on our and other websites because we participate in advertising networks. Ad networks allow us to target our messaging to users through demographic, interest-based, and contextual means. These networks track your online activities over time by collecting information through automated means, including through the use of cookies, web server logs, and web beacons, as described in the Information We Collect by Automated Means section above. The networks use this information to show you advertisements that may be tailored to your individual interests. The information our ad networks may collect includes information about your visits to websites that participate in the relevant advertising networks, such as the pages or advertisements you view and the actions you take on the websites. This data collection takes place both on our websites and on third-party websites that participate in the ad networks. For some campaigns, this information may be combined with other information we collect about you. This process also helps us track the effectiveness of our marketing efforts. [Learn how to opt out](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/) of this ad network interest-based advertising.

  * Administer contests, sweepstakes and surveys 
  * Contact you with marketing communications

Alaska Airlines uses the Ghostery, Inc. to comply with the cross-industry Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising managed by the [Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA)](http://www.aboutads.info/). As part of this service, online advertisements and websites are sometimes delivered with icons that help consumers understand how their data is being used and provide choice options to consumers that want more control.

We also use information collected on our Sites, as well as fingerprint data (if you choose to enroll in our fingerprint service), for identity verification purposes.

### Information We Share

We may also share personal information we collect on our Sites among our affiliates and joint marketing partners for the purposes described in this Privacy Notice, including for their marketing purposes. 

We may also share personal information we collect on our Sites with authorized operators of websites and applications that interact with our systems if you choose to use their applications to interact with us or if you otherwise authorize those operators to access our record of your personal information. For example, if you log in through an authorized third-party app that allows you to view your Mileage Plan™ account, we may share personal information with the operator of the app. Such operators' use of the information may be subject to their own privacy policies, which we strongly recommend you review before logging in through their applications. We are not responsible for such operators' privacy practices, which are not covered by this Privacy Notice.

Some third parties' embedded content or plugins on Sites, such as Facebook "Like" buttons on alaskaair.com, may allow their operators to learn that you have visited or interacted with our Sites, and they may combine this information with other, identifiable information they have collected about your visits to other websites or online services. These third parties may handle this information, and other information they directly collect through their content and plugins, pursuant to their own privacy policies.

As mandated by the U.S. government and governments outside the U.S., Alaska Airlines will provide to those governments specific passenger information collected on our Sites for travelers crossing international borders. For flights within the U.S., and pursuant to the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) Secure Flight Program, Alaska Airlines is required to collect and transmit the following passenger information: Name, Birth Date, Gender and Redress Number, if available, to the TSA. For information from the TSA about its privacy practices, please visit [](http://www.tsa.gov/)www.tsa.gov. 

We may also disclose personal information about you (i) if we are required to do so by other laws or legal process, (ii) to law enforcement authorities, or (iii) when we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to prevent harm or loss or in connection with an investigation of suspected or actual illegal activity.

We may share personal information with our service providers who perform services on our behalf. These service providers are not authorized by us to use or disclose the information except as necessary to perform services on our behalf or comply with legal requirements. 

We also reserve the right to transfer personal information we have about you in the event we sell or transfer all or a portion of our business or assets. Should such a sale or transfer occur, we will use reasonable efforts to direct the transferee to use personal information you have provided to us in a manner that is consistent with our Privacy Notice.
