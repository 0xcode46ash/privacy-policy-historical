This information may include such items as your name, address, date of birth, phone number, e-mail address, credit card number, and similar items. The collection of personal information will occur at the time you sign up for MyAlaskaAir, enroll in our Mileage Plan, subscribe to the alaskaair.com News e-mail newsletter, register for a promotion/contest/sweepstakes/survey, and when you purchase a ticket or other goods or services through our web sites. We may, on occasion, track your activity while visiting our web sites, in order to offer opportunities that we believe may be of value to you.

We collect anonymous statistical information regarding the use of this or other sites. This information may be used by our companies, or shared with other business partners to improve services or to market products. This information does not personally identify you.

We utilize [Secure Socket Layer (SSL)](http://www.alaskaair.com/www2/help/site/aboutssl.asp) technology to protect your personal information. This technology makes it safe to transmit your credit card numbers and other personal information over the Internet.

How Information is Stored

We store your personal information in secure operating environments that are not available to the public. Your personal information is accessible only by you and selected company employees. These employees are bound by duties of confidentiality and have access to selected databases, which are further protected by ID and password requirements.

The Alaska Airlines and Horizon Air web sites will in certain situations use [cookies](http://www.alaskaair.com/www2/help/site/Cookies.asp), which are stored on the computer that you use to visit our sites. These cookies help you obtain information you have requested as well as personalize your visit. The information in a cookie includes your name, home airport, preferred cities and a unique identifier.

In addition to internal Alaska Airlines and Horizon Air transaction databases and Mileage Plan system, your personal information can be stored in a MyAlaskaAir account that you create. A MyAlaskaAir account (web profile) is separate from a Alaska Airlines Mileage Plan (frequent flyer program) account.

Alaska Airlines and/or Horizon Air will not be responsible for any lost, stolen or disclosed ID's or passwords. Alaska Airlines and/or Horizon Air will never ask you for your password via e-mail, telephone or mail. The only time Alaska Airlines or Horizon Air will ask for your password is at a sign-in prompt from within an Alaska Airlines or Horizon Air domain (web address).

How Information is Used

We make the MyAlaskaAir functionality available to you in order to expedite your transactions on our site (through the use of pre-filled forms) and to provide you with better service. In order for you to complete a purchase or conduct other transactions on our site, we may require the creation of a MyAlaskaAir account, which requires that you submit certain personal information to Alaska Airlines.

Your personal information may be used by Alaska Airlines and/or Horizon Air to direct specific offers to you. Participation in these offers is solely at your discretion. Additionally, we may share pertinent personal information with our relevant business partners for the limited purpose of enabling these partners to fulfill your transaction (e.g. car rental and hotel providers). Further, we may contact you regarding the status of your transactions at our sites or to inform you of maintenance to your accounts (MyAlaskaAir, Mileage Plan) or web site updates. Your information may also be used by Alaska Airlines, Horizon Air, or shared with third parties in order to complete surveys, sweepstakes, contests, or promotions in which you choose to participate.

From time to time, we may share information contained in your Mileage Plan account with our Mileage Plan Partners in order to provide you with more opportunities to earn or redeem miles, or to advise you of other benefits associated with our Mileage Plan program. For your protection, we do not include your e-mail address when providing personal information to third parties for the purpose of special Mileage Plan offers. Additionally, please note that your credit card information is not stored in your Mileage Plan account. If you do not desire such disclosure, e-mail the Mileage Plan at opt.out@alaskaair.com or write the Mileage Plan at: Alaska Airlines Mileage Plan, P.O. Box 24948, Seattle, WA 98124. Be sure to include your name, address, telephone, and Mileage Plan account number on your request. Or you may call Mileage Plan at 1-800-654-5669. As soon as is practicable, following our receipt of your request to that effect, we will cease to release your information to such partners. With regards to the above Mileage Plan offers, for your protection, Mileage Plan does not share member names and mailing addresses with anyone other than Mileage Plan partners. Mileage Plan also does not share names and addresses of Mileage Plan members that they know or believe to be under age 18 with anyone outside of Alaska Airlines.
