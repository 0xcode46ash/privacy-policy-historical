# AlarmNet Terms and Conditions

ADEMCO Group, a Honeywell company, is sensitive to privacy issues on the Internet and is committed to protecting your privacy on our Web sites. ADEMCO Group takes reasonable precautions to keep all information obtained from our online visitors secure against unauthorized access and use and we periodically review our security measures. We have established the following guidelines to explain the way in which we use information gathered from visitors to our Web sites: 

What information does ADEMCO Group collect?

In general, you can visit ADEMCO Group on the Web to access information while remaining anonymous and not revealing any personal information. There are times, however, that we will ask you to provide certain information (such as your name and address) so that we may understand you better and make you aware of any new products that you might be interested in. Our Web server may also collect the domain names, but not the e-mail addresses, of visitors to our Web site. We use information to monitor and assist us in improving the content on our Web. 

How will ADEMCO Group protect your personal information?

Forms you fill out to interact with our business units may request that you give us sensitive information such as your e-mail address, mailing address, telephone number or a credit card number. Whenever that is the case, ADEMCO Group will take all commercially reasonable steps to establish a secure connection with your Web browser. For ADEMCO Group sites which conduct electronic commerce, credit card numbers are used only for payment processing and will not be disclosed to any third parties. 

Note that our Web site contains links to other non-ADEMCO Group Web sites. Although we try to link only to Web sites that share our concern for customer information privacy, we are not responsible for their content or their privacy practices. 

How to update personal information

You can help us to maintain the accuracy of your information by notifying ADEMCO Group of any change to your mailing address, phone number or e-mail address.
