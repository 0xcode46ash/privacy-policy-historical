# Astrolabe History

To better protect your privacy, we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used. To make it easy to find, we have made it available on our homepage. This notice applies to all information collected or submitted on the Astrolabe website. 

**The Information We Collect:** On some pages, you can order products, request free charts, subscribe to our newsletter, or make emailed requests for more information or for technical support. In order to fulfill such requests, we need to ask for information like your 

Name  


Address  


Email address  


Phone number  


Credit/Debit Card Information  


Birth date, time and place (when you are ordering an astrological chart or report).

You can also submit information about other people. For example, if you order a gift online and want it sent directly to the recipient, you will need to give us the recipient's address. In such circumstances, the types of personal information collected could be similar to the above, except for credit card and other billing information.

**The Way We Use Information:** The only ways we use personal information are as follows:  


We use the information you provide about yourself when placing an order to complete that order and that information remains as part of our customer records. We may use your contact information in the future for targeted mailings via email or through the postal service. When you purchase an astrological report or chart, we may store your birth data.   


We use the information you provide about someone else when placing an order to ship the product and to confirm delivery. This information also becomes part of our customer records.  


We use your return email address to answer your email, send an order confirmation, or to email your free charts or chart report purchases to you.  


If you come to our site from an affiliate third party site, we may share your contact information with the owners of that third party site.

**Other Uses of Email Addresses:** When you supply your email address, we may use it to subscribe you to our email newsletter, AUGuries. AUGuries is generally published at intervals from four to eight weeks and includes interesting astrological information as well as updates on our new products, services and sales. You can unsubscribe to AUGuries at any time by following the instructions at the bottom of our notices. 

Sometimes we may also use our email list to provide you with information on products and services from non-profit astrological organizations or from third parties with whom we partner in a joint venture. We never, however, sell or share our email list to any third party. Instead, we would incorporate their message into an email originated at Astrolabe.

If you wish, you can be removed from our email list by following the instructions that appear at the bottom of every mass email. 

**Collecting Site Statistics:** To improve the design of our website, we collect demographic information and statistics on things like which pages are visited the most. This information is stored without your name and email address attached to it. Sometimes we might share such statistics with another organization -- for example, telling them that X number of individuals visited a certain area on our website. In sharing such information, we would not disclose anything that could be used to identify you individually. 

**Data Security:** To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect from you online.

**How You Can Access Or Correct Your Information:** To be removed from our email list or to correct factual errors in your personally identifiable information, you can send us an email at astrolabe@alabe.com. To protect your privacy and security, we will take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access or making corrections.

**How To Contact Us:** If you have any questions, concerns or comments about these privacy policies, please send us an email at [astrolabe@alabe.com](mailto:astrolabe@alabe.com?subject=Privacy%20Policy).
