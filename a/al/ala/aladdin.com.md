When you download free security software from our Sites, we require certain information including name, e-mail address and phone number. You have the option of requesting that we do not contact you. 

We do not currently sell any software online, so we do not currently collect credit card or other financial information from you. 

We may keep a record of correspondence if you contact us. We may also from time to time send you information about our products or special offers through standard mail or e-mail. 

Please Note: We provide links on our Sites to other sites of interest and that we do not review or endorse the content of these sites, or guarantee that they will abide by this privacy policy. Your use of such linked sites is subject to the terms and conditions and privacy policies of the providers of those sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our Site and to read the privacy statements of each web site that collects personal information. 

  2. With Whom We Share Your Information 

We do not share your personal information with any company outside of Aladdin; however, we may notify you of special offers from our business partners using the contact information you provide. Aladdin reserves the right to perform statistical analyses and profiling of user behavior and characteristics in order to measure interest in, and use of, the various areas of our Site and to inform third parties of such aggregated, non-personally identifying information. 

  3. What Cookies Are and How We Use Them 

A cookie is a small amount of data that is stored on your computer's hard drive and that allows certain products to function without interfering with other computer operations. 

We use cookies to aid the users in the usage of Aladdin products, and the user will be queried prior to use of the cookies. You have the ability to disable application of cookies in your Internet browser (Netscape, Explorer, etc.). 

  4. How You Can Access, Update or Delete Your Information 

When you enter the Aladdin.com website, you can subscribe or unsubscribe to any of our mailing lists by clicking on "eNewsletter Sign Up" on the left homepage menu, entering your email address into the form which opens up, and checking/unchecking any mailing list to which you want to be added or deleted.

  5. Security Precautions We Take to Safeguard Information You Provide to Us 

Our Sites have security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information provided on the Site. The information is transferred on a secure private network to a database offline. 

While we strive to protect your personally identifying information, the Internet is not fully secure. Consequently, Aladdin cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us and you do so at your own risk.
