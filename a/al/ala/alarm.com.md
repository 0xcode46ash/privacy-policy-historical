###  Our Privacy Mission 

Alarm.com provides subscribers numerous advanced-technology security and automation services not available anywhere else on the market. We are sensitive to the private nature of the information you provide to us over the internet. Our privacy policy is designed to maximize your ability to protect your personal, private data while at the same time giving you the opportunity to remotely monitor and access your security system. Our mission in implementing this privacy policy is to, first, protect your personal information, and second, use it only to provide you with the highest quality services always for your own benefit and exclusively on your behalf. This policy states our privacy practices for you, the subscriber, and your use of the [www.alarm.com](https://www.alarm.com/) website, our Mobile site, our Voice Portal, and all interactions between you and Alarm.com. Please read the Privacy Policy carefully.

###  Information Collection and Use

Alarm.com collects and stores personally identifiable information about you only when you expressly and knowingly provide it. You provide us basic contact information such as name, address, phone number and email address. When you subscribe to our services, you provide us your personal preferences (e.g., unit description, sensor names) in order for us to personalize your services. However, we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of thirteen.

We will use your personally identifiable information only to provide you the best possible services – to personalize the services delivered to you or notify you of technical issues or changes in our services. If you opt-in, we may contact you periodically to participate in our market research efforts so that we may improve our services to meet your needs.

###  Information Sharing

Alarm.com will not disclose your personally identifiable information to any other entity except:

  * to your dealer, the company through which you subscribed to our services. Your dealer has the right to use the information only in conformance with their privacy policy, but your dealer has no right to share the information with any third party not directly servicing your account. Accordingly, if you have any concerns about how your dealer will respect your privacy, please refer to their privacy policy before providing us – and therefore them – with any information.
  * when you have opted in to share the information with the entity.
  * when we need to share the information with an entity who works on our behalf to provide the services. (These entities do not have any right to use the personally identifiable information we provide to them beyond what is necessary to assist us.)
  * in response to a legal order, or when Alarm.com believes you have acted in violation of your dealer's terms of use.



To be clear, Alarm.com will not provide your personally identifiable information to our advertisers, advertising servers, or advertising agencies.

###  Information Protection

Alarm.com has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of your information. We protect your information through a unique username and password, and we protect certain sensitive communications with our website through server authentication and secure connections.

###  Viewing, Updating, and Deleting Information

You may view, update, or delete your personally identifiable information at any time by following the links at [www.alarm.com](https://www.alarm.com/) to your profile and address book pages. These changes will be immediately made to our records. If you wish to stop notifications, you may do so through the website.

Customers of Alarm.com Dealers: Changes to your user profile will not affect the records of your dealer. You should contact your dealer directly to make changes to its records.

A cookie is a string of information sent by a user interface and stored on your hard drive or temporarily in your computer's memory. This allows the user interfaces to recognize you as you move through the user interfaces. At your discretion, Alarm.com may store and access cookies on your machine to allow you to bypass the process of re-entering your username each time you access the Alarm.com website.
