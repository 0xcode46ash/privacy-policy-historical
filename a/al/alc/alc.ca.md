3\. Tickets may be sold to the public by the Corporation throughout the Atlantic provinces or by a retailer within the place or area where such retailer is authorized, but the Corporation, may at any time and at its discretion, refuse to issue tickets bearing any selection, or limit the number of selections that may be made by or the number of tickets that may be sold to any person(s).

  4. upon request, satisfies the Corporation that he/she was the full age of majority, according to the laws of the Province in which he/she resided, at the time the winning ticket was purchased.



12\. Retailers and distributors incur no liability toward anyone in the case of acts of God, fortuitous events or force majeurs.

14\. Except for money prizes, the Corporation may, in its sole discretion, substitute for any prize i) the cash equivalent to the Corporation's cost of such prize or ii) a prize of any equivalent cost to the Corporation. No representation or warranty as to the fitness and serviceability of any merchandise or service prize is given or to be implied. 

15\.

  1. satisfies the Corporation that he/she is the holder of a valid ticket and, when he/she claims a prize, that such ticket is a winning ticket, and that the conditions of section 11 have been fulfilled; and 
  2. produces a written claim and such winning ticket to the Corporation prior to the expiry of one (1) year commencing on the date of the draw or within the time limit otherwise specified on the ticket, whichever is earliest



17\. In the event of any dispute with regard to a prize, the Corporation may in the case of money prize, pay the money into Court or as directed by the Court and, in the case of any other prize, deliver the prize or evidence of entitlement thereto to the Court pending determination of the matter by a Court of competent jurisdiction.
