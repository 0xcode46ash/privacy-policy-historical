# All Academic - Privacy Statement

All Academic collects author information for the primary purpose of providing researchers with useful, accurate, and quality source identification. The inability to identify the author or at least the background and qualifications that lend credibility to an authors work presents a significant problem with most academic searches on the internet. All Academic does not solve all of the problems that arise from the relationship between author and text on the internet. Author information is self-reported and updated by the user. This creates the potential for some inaccuracies to occur in reporting. Still, the information we provide gives researchers a starting point for evaluating author qualifications. Those citations that are found to contain false or inaccurate information are immediately removed from the index. We reserve the right to refuse any citation that contains inaccuracies. 

**Information Obtained**

All Academic collects the following information about authors: name, vocation, place of employment or representative institution, email, highest degree (type) obtained, and other qualifications (open to the author or person inputting the author information). We also collect email of the person entering author information (if someone other than the author). 

**Fair Use**

The information we provide is for academic purposes only. All Academic does not willingly provide indexed information to other commercial enterprises, author information cataloged at this site should not be used or sold by researchers for commercial benefit. 

**Cookies**

All Academic may set and access [cookies](https://web.archive.org/cookies.html) on your computer. 

All Academic allows other companies that are presenting advertisements on some of our pages to set and access their cookies on your computer. Other companies' use of their cookies is subject to their own privacy policies, not this one. Advertisers or other companies do not have access to All Academic's cookies. 

**Limiting Information**
