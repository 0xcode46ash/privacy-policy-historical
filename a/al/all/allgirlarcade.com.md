The parent or guardian will receive an e-mail notifying them that the identified child wishes to register on _www.SparkCityWorld.com_ The parent or legal guardian will then be required to follow the directions in such notification in order to activate the kid's registration.

In the event that we change our policy with respect to the collection of personal information from kids, or if new features, contests or sweepstakes which a kid wishes to use or participate in require the provision of personal information, their parent or guardian will be notified and will be required to give their consent to the collection and use of such information and/or be given the option to opt out of participation.

We do allow Parent/Guardians to purchase a VIP membership that will allow their child unlimited access to all that Spark City has to offer, this includes: clothing, pets, private/VIP areas, furniture, special events and more. 

A Parent/Guardian is able to consent to the site's use of the child's Personal Information without having also to consent to the site's disclosure of the child's Personal Information to third parties. You may contact us at _support@SparkCityWorld.com_.
