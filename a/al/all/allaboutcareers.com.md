## Meet the team

  * Paul Harris Co-founder 

### Paul Harris co-founder

The big cheese, the charmer, the moviegoer.

#### Best film ever seen?

Hands down, The Lion King. Such an emotional rollercoaster. It proves that even chiefs of the magnitude of Mufasa aren’t safe in this world. I’m welling up now even thinking about it.

  * Jack Denton Co-founder 

### Jack Denton co-founder

The big dog, the raconteur, the linguaphile.

#### Worst job after graduating?

Working on a chicken farm. Have you seen Napoleon Dynamite? It’s like that but worse. Dead chickens in bins a metre from where I was working, stifling heat and constant attacks from angry cockerels. It was alright, though, because they were paying me £3 an hour.

      * M 0778 000 0810

  * Jack Collins operations 

### Jack Collins operations

The coordinator, the ideas guy, the pop punk nerd.

#### Greatest epic fail?

When asked to do a presentation during a job interview at an advertising agency, I did some seriously mental ‘outside the box’ thinking and rearranged the office furniture into the shape of a car. I didn’t get the job.

  * Billy Sexton project management 

### Billy Sexton project management

The planner, the solutions guy, the East London enthusiast.

#### Biggest secret?

Once I was at a market and there was a person offering free food samples. The sign said ‘Please Take One’ but I took two instead. Mental.

    *       * T 0203 651 4919



  * Charlie Mead Account Management 

### Charlie MeadAccount Management

The sports enthusiast, the OCD boy, the charmer.

#### What do you love most in the world?

Sweets. My dentist tells me off but I will always have a packet of sweets in my bag - from Haribo to Fruit Gums, even Pic 'n' Mix on special occasions, I just love sweets.

    * E charlie/mead//allaboutgroup/org
    *       * T 0203 651 4919

  * Ed Dean Account Management 

### Ed DeanAccount Management

The risk taker, the festival goer, the napper.

#### What are your pet hates?

Loud eaters and slow walkers.

    *       * T 0203 651 4919

  * Mike Stocks Business Development 

### Mike StocksBusiness Development

The conversationalist, the wanderer, the culture vulture.

#### A crazy travel experience?

Most of it! Although working in a bar on the coast of Colombia was a bit mental. Lots of rum, lots of sweat and a whole heap of debauchery.

    * E mike/stocks//allaboutgroup/org
    *       * T 0203 651 4919

  * Rayer Van-Ristell Business Development 

### Rayer Van-RistellBusiness Development

The entrepreneur, the socialite, the Clark Kent lookalike.

#### Best childhood memory?

I crashed a car at the tender age of three. Jumped into the front seat, pulled it in reverse and knocked the door off a brand new Mercedes Benz. Needless to say my Dad wasn’t very happy… Though perhaps slightly proud!

    * E rayer/van-ristell//allaboutgroup/org
    *       * T 0203 651 4919



  * Tom Clark Business Development 

### Tom Clark Business Development

The opportunist, the late bloomer, the overrated footballer.

#### Biggest Regret?

Upon graduation of university my favourite lecturer came over to congratulate me with a few kind words and a firm handshake. Unfortunately due to, possibly the nerves and probably the celebratory drinks, I forgot to remove the half eaten pork pie from my outstretched hand. The disgusted look of the esteemed academic as our hands mashed the meaty snack will haunt my dreams for ever more.

### Laura EdgingtonMarketing

The social media suave, the small one, the lover of seafood.

    *       * T 0203 651 4919

  * Emma Finamore editorial 

### Emma Finamore editorial

The wordsmith, the indie-kid, the cheese-enthusiast.

#### What’s the weirdest job you’ve ever had?

Of all the weird jobs I’ve had (selling wills over the phone, folding Christmas cards, folding boxes for Christmas cards) there’s an extra-special place in my heart for the summer I spent in a Breaking Bad-style boiler suit - and a rather fetching hair net - in a frozen dessert factory called “Delicious Moments”, crushing biscuits to make the bases for cheesecakes.

Mmmm. Delicious.

  * Jack ‘Jay’ Collinseditorial 

### Jack ‘Jay’ Collinseditorial

The poet, the jack-of-all-trades, the DJ.

#### Guilty pleasure?

I’m absolutely obsessed with darts. Whether it’s playing, watching or just reading about it on the internet, I just can’t seem to get enough of the idea of throwing sharp metal mini-javelins at a board on a wall.

    * E jay/collins//allaboutgroup/org
    *       * T 0203 651 4919



  * Georgia Leefe communications 

### Georgia Leefecommunications

The rhetorician, the pug lover, the wearer of purple.

#### Biggest necessity?

Singing in the shower first thing every morning. It releases endorphins. Nina, Ella and Dolly are my girls.

    * E georgia/leefe//allaboutgroup/org
    *       * T 0203 651 4919

  * Josh Krohn Design

  * Adam Zapasnik Back-End Development

A mountain of chicken and mashed potato. A cheeky nap. And then another mountain of chicken and mashed potato.
