# Privacy Policy at All poetry

## Information Collection and Use

When you register and use the site, we collect information, including your: 

  * email address 
  * subscription history or other purchases 
  * various personalization information 



The above information is used to customize the content and advertising you see, fulfill your requests for products and services, improve our services, contact you, conduct research, and provide anonymous reporting. 

In addition, your ip address, cookie information, and what pages you request is automatically saved to our server access logs. This is used to generate statistics about how many people are using our site, etc. 

## Your email address

  * Is a required part of your registration 
  * We may use your email address to contact you infrequently or in emergencies 
  * We will never sell or give it to any third-party companies. 



## Sharing with other members

  * As a part of your user profile, we provide the ability to disclose an email address, instant messenger alias, and other communication methods. 
  * Any logged in member, legitimate or otherwise, has the ability to see this. 
  * It is not our responsibility if they misuse such information. 
  * We will never sell this information to third-party companies 



## Children

  * We require that any children under the age of 13 talk to a parent or guardian before completing registration. Children should always ask their parents before submitting their email address or other information about themselves. 



## Advertising

  * We may choose to display targeted advertisements based on personal information. Advertisers may assume that people who interact with, view, or click on targeted ads meet the target criteria - for example, women ages 30-40 from a particular geographic area. Most of our ads are not targeted. 
  * We do not provide any personal information to the advertiser when you interact with or view a targeted ad. However, by interacting with or viewing an ad you are consenting to the possibility that the advertiser will make the assumption that you meet the targeting criteria used to display the ad. 



## Cookies

  * Many people are unsure what cookies are and are unfamiliar with them. 
  * We use cookies to keep you logged in from page to page, so that you do not have to type in your login information on every page of the site. 
  * All the cookie stores is that your username is 'blah', and an encrypted copy of your password. 



## Confidentiality and Security

  * We limit access to personal information about you to employees or volunteers who we believe reasonably need to come into contact with that information to provide products or services to you or in order to do their jobs. This is as few people as possible, and such activity is logged for verification by others. 
  * Such information includes instant messages sent between users of the site. Only moderators of director level and above can view these, and only with a specific reason. 
  * We reserve the right at all times to disclose any information as we deem necessary to satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request. 
  * Always use caution when giving out any personally identifiable information about yourself or your children in any online communication.
