# Privacy Policy

  
Your privacy is critically important to us. At **Hittin' The Web Group** we have a few fundamental principles: 

We don’t ask you for personal information unless we truly need it. We don’t share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop our products, or protect our rights. We don’t store personal information on our servers unless required for the on-going operation of one of our services. We aim to make it as simple as possible for you to control what’s visible to the public, seen by search engines, kept private, and permanently deleted. Below is our privacy policy which incorporates these goals. 

If you have questions about deleting or correcting your personal data please contact us at webmaster at hittintheweb dot com.

**Hittin' The Web Group** operates several websites including [allmanbrothersband.com](http://www.allmanbrothersband.com/), [greggallman.com](http://www.greggallman.com/), [dickeybetts.com](http://www.dickeybetts.com/), [duaneallman.com](http://www.duaneallman.com/), [peachcorps.com](http://www.peachcorps.com/), [winerefrigeratorguide.com](http://www.winerefrigeratorguide.com/), and [winediningfun.com](http://www.winediningfun.com/). It is **Hittin' The Web Group** ’s policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our websites.

### Website Visitors

Like most website operators, **Hittin' The Web Group** collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. **Hittin' The Web Group** ’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how **Hittin' The Web Group** ’s visitors use its website. From time to time, **Hittin' The Web Group** may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.

**Hittin' The Web Group** also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on our websites, forums, discussion groups, guest books, and any other website feature that allows commenting. **Hittin' The Web Group** only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below, except that website commenter IP addresses are visible and disclosed to the administrators of the website where the comment was left.

### Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information

Certain visitors to **Hittin' The Web Group** ’s websites choose to interact with **Hittin' The Web Group** in ways that require **Hittin' The Web Group** to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that **Hittin' The Web Group** gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who register at our websites to provide a username and email address. Those who engage in transactions with **Hittin' The Web Group** – by purchasing advertising, for example – are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, **Hittin' The Web Group** collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with **Hittin' The Web Group**. **Hittin' The Web Group** does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.

**Hittin' The Web Group** may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. For instance, **Hittin' The Web Group** may monitor the page view pattern of its websites or clickthroughs on advertising. **Hittin' The Web Group** may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, **Hittin' The Web Group** does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.

### Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information

**Hittin' The Web Group** discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on **Hittin' The Web Group** ’s behalf or to provide services available at **Hittin' The Web Group** ’s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using **Hittin' The Web Group** ’s websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. **Hittin' The Web Group** will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, **Hittin' The Web Group** discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when **Hittin' The Web Group** believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of **Hittin' The Web Group** , third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of a **Hittin' The Web Group** website and have supplied your email address and opted-in to receive one of our newsletters, **Hittin' The Web Group** may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new products, website features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with **Hittin' The Web Group** and our offerings. We will also send you email to welcome you as a new registered user and to help you recover your password if you are unable to log in. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. **Hittin' The Web Group** takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.
