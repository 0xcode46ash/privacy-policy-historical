# Allianz Australia | Privacy

## New laws about privacy

Protecting your privacy and the confidentiality of your personal information is important to us, as it is fundamental to the way we conduct business. 

Allianz is sensitive to privacy issues and treats very seriously the ongoing trust our customers have placed in us. Over 60 million customers in more than 70 countries trust their information to Allianz worldwide.

You can relax knowing that Allianz Australia aspires to Insurance Industry best practice procedures and believe we have some of the most robust systems in place for handling and protecting your private information.

## Why do we require your personal information?

The personal information collected and maintained by Allianz Australia comprises your name, address, contact details and information specific to your product preference. 

For some policies we also collect and maintain your sensitive information. This comprises information about your health, membership of any trade unions or professional associations and any criminal convictions you may have.

The information requested allows us to assess risks, write and administer your insurance cover and claims. 

## Disclosure of your personal information to third parties

As with most insurers, Allianz Australia relies on third party suppliers (agents, loss adjusters, assessors, other insurers, mailhouses etc) to carry out specialised activities. These third parties act on behalf of Allianz Australia. Whilst your personal information may be provided to these third parties to enable them to perform their agreed activities, they are bound by confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements and are prohibited from using the information for any other purpose. We also ensure they are aware of our obligations under the Privacy Act and that they agree to be bound by these obligations.
