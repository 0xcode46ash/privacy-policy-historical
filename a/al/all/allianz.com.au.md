# Privacy | Allianz Australia

Protecting your privacy and the confidentiality of your personal information is important to us, as it is fundamental to the way we conduct business. 

Allianz is sensitive to privacy issues and treats very seriously the ongoing trust our customers have placed in us. 60 million customers in more than 70 countries trust their information to the worldwide Allianz Group.

You can relax knowing that Allianz aspires to Insurance Industry best practice procedures and believe we have robust systems in place for handling and protecting your private information.  


## Who is Allianz?

Allianz is an Australian, wholly owned subsidiary of Allianz AG, one of the world's largest general insurance and financial service providers.

## What is "personal information"?

Personal information is any information whereby your identity may be ascertained.

## What is the purpose for the collection of your personal information?

Where it is possible we will collect personal information directly from you. The personal information collected and maintained by Allianz comprises your name, address, contact details and information specific to your product preference. 

However, in some circumstances we will need to collect your personal information from third parties. These circumstances may include collection of your personal information from an insurance investigator or a medical practitioner for the purposes of assessing your claim under the insurance policy.

For some policies we also collect and maintain your sensitive information. This comprises information about your health, membership of any trade unions or professional associations and any criminal convictions you may have.

The information requested allows us to assess risks, write and administer your insurance cover and claims. 

If we do not collect your personal information we will not be able to do business with you.

## Disclosure of your personal information to third parties

We disclose personal information to third parties who we believe are necessary to assist us and them in providing the relevant services and products. For example, in handling claims, we may have to disclose your personal and other information to third parties such as other insurers, reinsurers, loss adjusters, external claims data collectors, investigators, and agents or other parties as required by law. We limit the use and disclosure of any personal information provided by us to them to the specific purpose for which we supplied it.

In providing the relevant products and services to you, we may share your personal information with related companies within Allianz.

## Contacting us about access and correction of your personal information

Allianz aims to ensure that your personal information is accurate, up to date and complete. Please contact us on 1300 360 529 EST 9am – 5pm, Mon-Fri if you would like to seek access to, or revise your personal information or feel that the information we currently have on record is incorrect or incomplete.

If you believe that the privacy of your personal information at Allianz has been interfered with, you may lodge a complaint by contact us on 1300 360 529 EST 9am – 5pm, Mon-Fri or in writing to Corporate Compliance, Allianz Australia Limited, GPO Box 4049, Sydney, NSW, 2001. Your complaint will be managed and resolved through our internal Privacy Complaint Procedure.

If, however, you are not satisfied with the way Allianz has handled your complaint you may contact the Privacy Compliance Committee of the Insurance Enquiries and Complaints Limited ("IEC") that can determine complaints against insurers. The IEC is a company that is independent of insurers.

Where appropriate the Privacy Compliance Committee may refer your complaint directly to the Federal Privacy Commissioner if the complaint relates to non-insurance matters and is outside the scope of the IEC's authority.

From time to time we may advise or offer you information on other Allianz products or services that may be relevant and of interest to you. If you do not wish to receive these offers or information, please complete our online "Opt Out" form below or call the Allianz Direct Marketing Privacy Service Line – Freecall 1800 000 284.
