Protecting your privacy and the confidentiality of your personal information is important to us, as it is fundamental to the way we conduct business. 

Allianz is sensitive to privacy issues and treats very seriously the ongoing trust our customers have placed in us. 60 million customers in more than 70 countries trust their information to the worldwide Allianz Group.

You can relax knowing that Allianz aspires to Insurance Industry best practice procedures and believe we have robust systems in place for handling and protecting your private information.

## Who is Allianz?

Allianz is an Australian, wholly owned subsidiary of Allianz AG, one of the world's largest general insurance and financial service providers.

Our address is 2 Market Street, Sydney, NSW, 2000. We can be reached via email at customerservice@allianz.com.au or by calling 13 2664.

## What is "personal information"?

Personal information is any information whereby your identity may be ascertained.

## What is the purpose for the collection of your personal information?

Where it is possible we will collect personal information directly from you. The personal information collected and maintained by Allianz comprises your name, address, contact details and information specific to your product preference. 

However, in some circumstances we will need to collect your personal information from third parties. These circumstances may include collection of your personal information from an insurance investigator or a medical practitioner for the purposes of assessing your claim under the insurance policy.

When you give personal information about other individuals, we and our agents rely on you to have made or make them aware:

  * that you will or may provide their information to us;
  * the types of third parties to whom the information my be provided;
  * the relevant purposes we and the third parties will disclose it to, will use it for; and
  * how they can access it.



We rely on you to have obtained their consent on these matters. If you have not done or will not do either of these things, you must tell us or our agents before you provide the relevant information.

For some policies we also collect and maintain your sensitive information. This comprises information about your health, membership of any trade unions or professional associations and any criminal convictions you may have.

The information requested allows us to assess risks, write and administer your insurance cover and claims. 

If we do not collect your personal information we will not be able to do business with you.

## Disclosure of your personal information to third parties

We disclose personal information to third parties who we believe are necessary to assist us and them in providing the relevant services and products. For example, in handling claims, we may have to disclose your personal and other information to third parties such as other insurers, reinsurers, loss adjusters, external claims data collectors, investigators, and agents or other parties as required by law. We limit the use and disclosure of any personal information provided by us to them to the specific purpose for which we supplied it.

In providing the relevant products and services to you, we may share your personal information with related companies within Allianz.

Personal information for the purposes specified above may be shared on a confidential basis with:

  * our related body corporates;
  * our distributors and agents;
  * other insurers and reinsurers;
  * insurance reference bureaus;
  * government agents;
  * data collection and verification agencies;
  * loss adjusters and assessors;
  * repairers and suppliers;
  * investigators and recovery agents;
  * police, law and credit enforcement bodies and agencies;
  * legal advisors;
  * medical, health and case managers and service providers;

  * contracted advisors and service providers;
  * professional and other organisations;
  * your employer;
  * other parties as required by law and/or
  * the agent of any of these.
