We only allow information to be submitted for transmission if your browser is compatible with our security software.

We take seriously the issue of safeguarding your privacy online. However, please note that you should exercise discretion with respect to the submission of any personal or financial information.

We encourage customers to either send confidential correspondence through the postal service or use the telephone to speak directly to our employees. We are not responsible for the security of confidentiality of communications you send to us through the Internet using e-mail messages.
