# Privacy Policy

allfancydress.com is a website and takes reasonable care to comply with the requirements of the UK Data Protection Act 1998 relating to the personal information you supply on the Site. We use 128 bit encryptions when transferring data supplied by you relating to your personal details. However, as no data transmissions over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us and you do so at your own risk.

allfancydress.com will not sell or distribute your personal information to any 3rd parties without your prior consent or unless required or permitted to do so by law.

The information we collect may include your name, delivery address, credit or debit card number and expiry date, email address, telephone number, and any personal preferences. If you subscribe to our mailing lists for new product launches and other information such as special offers, you will be able to remove yourself at any time by [**contacting us**](http://www.allfancydress.com/Pages/PrivacyPolicy.aspx) or clicking the 'unsubscribe' link at the bottom of any email communication from us.

In addition to the information which you supply to us, information and data may be automatically collected through the use of cookies. Cookies are small text files and are used for various purposes such as remembering the contents of your shopping basket.

**Email AFD to a friend**  
'Email AFD to a friend' is a referral service, allowing customers to recommend allfancydress.com to a friend, and is a two-step process. First, a customer sends us the friend's name and email address, and secondly, we contact the friend, telling them who we are, and inviting them to visit our website. When we contact your friend, we always advise them of the name and email address of the friend who made the original referral. None of the information provided for this service is stored by us and we will not use you or your friends details for any other purpose.

We may occasionally modify this Privacy Policy, such variations becoming effective immediately upon posting to the site and by continuing to use the site, you will be deemed to accept any such variations.
