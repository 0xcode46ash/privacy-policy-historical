> **Privacy Policy** **Your Personal Information**
> 
> We at AllAboutDance.com recognize your right to confidentiality and are committed to protecting your privacy. We use the information that we collect on our site to provide you with a superior shopping experience. When you order, we will ask you to set up "your account," which includes your name, e-mail address, mailing address and other general information. In addition, we ask that you indicate whether you would like to receive e-mail from AllAboutDance.com keeping you informed of new products or features. If you would like to review or revise the information we have in your account, you may access such information by clicking on the "account" link on any screen.

> We protect your account information against unauthorized access or release. We will not give, sell, rent, or loan any identifiable personal information to any third party, unless you have authorized us to or we are legally required to do so. From time to time, we may enter into an agreement with other companies to send promotional e-mails on our behalf to such companies' customers. If we do, we may provide a list of our customer's e-mail addresses to the other company so that you, as an existing AllAboutDance.com customer, will not receive repetitive promotional materials. Other than e-mail addresses, no information will be shared with the other company. Such companies will be prohibited from using the e-mail list for any other purpose and will be bound to the terms of our privacy policy with respect to the e-mail list. We may share non-personal, summary, or aggregate customer data with partners and other third parties.
