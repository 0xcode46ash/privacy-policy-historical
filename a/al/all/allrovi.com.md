**_YOUR INFORMATION: WHAT WE COLLECT, HOW WE COLLECT IT, AND HOW IT IS USED_**

In common with most other websites and on-line services, we collect certain data about your visit to the Rovi Properties. Any information we do gather via Rovi Property falls into three categories: (1) personal information that you supply when you register, create an online account, complete a survey, enter a contest, provide your e-mail address in order to receive services, etc.; (2) information that is collected as you use Rovi Property that then becomes specifically identified with your personal information and (3) anonymous information collected as you use Rovi Property using your IP address and a standard piece of data stored on your computer called a “cookie”. Information collected includes which pages and content that you browse, how you interact with advertising and our content, how long you spend looking at each page and a picture we build up of your preferences and usage. We use this information in order to provide more relevant services to you, including advertising, to improve the usefulness and effectiveness of the information displayed on the Rovi Properties and the effectiveness of its layout in helping users reach that information.

Certain Rovi Property or certain features of Rovi Properties may be used anonymously by you, and you will not be required to register or create an account for those Rovi Properties and we will not collect your personally identifiable information. As described above, we may build up a history of your anonymous interactions with the Rovi Properties in order to provide more relevant services to you and your interactions with Rovi Properties, even though we don’t know who you are. For other Rovi Properties and other features of Rovi Properties, you may need to register, you may need to create an account and we may collect your personally identifiable information. 

**Personally identifiable information**

As is common across websites, to use certain features of allrovi.com (including the Rovi Property available on allrovi.com), we ask you to register, create an account, provide your full name and email address and create a password. Once you have created an account, you will have the option to fill out a form (also known as your profile) with information about yourself. When you create your profile, we collect personally identifiable information about yourself such as name, location, e-mail address, favourite actors, music, etc. which will be stored in order to conduct activities including

to process your registration, maintain a profile about you, process your request to receive newsletters and email announcements, or to voluntarily participate in surveys or contests and to communicate with you about our services and other products or services we think may be of interest to you. We also collect this data to provide personalised services to you such as providing you with recommendations or to track and provide you with information about your preferences and things such as your likes, dislikes and ratings. We also use it in an anonymized and aggregated form to better understand our user base in order to be able to improve our site features, services and functionality. This information is also used for the other purposes as described below

**Tracking information -- Cookies, Clear GIFs, and IP addresses**

We store and track user information by using "cookies" and clear GIFs, which are also sometimes called web bugs or web beacons. Cookies alone do not tell us your e-mail address or other personally identifiable information unless you opt to provide this information to us by, for example, by registering to use certain Rovi Properties. A cookie is data sent to your browser from a web server. It is stored on your computer's hard drive, and contains a unique identifier that allows our sites to recognize your computer. If you have an account with Rovi, a cookie on your computer lets us remember your user name and password so you don't have to re-enter that information each time you visit the site. It also helps us to try to ensure that your account is only accessed and used by you.

The use of cookies is standard on the Internet, and you will find they are currently used by many major websites. You can set your web browser preferences to alert you when a cookie is sent to your hard drive, or to refuse cookies altogether. We do not require you to use cookies, but please keep in mind that certain features and services will not function properly if you set your browser to refuse cookies.

"Clear GIFs" are very small image files that we sometimes place on web pages and within web-based email newsletters or other communication we send. Together with cookies, clear GIFs let us accurately count the number of unique users who have visited specific pages and the number of times those pages are accessed. Clear GIFs also let us know how many people opened an email.

When you use any of the Rovi Property, we may use cookies, clear GIFs and other tracking technology to collect information such as your browser type, the type of operating system you use, the domain name of your Internet service provider, IP address, pages visited on the site, services used and how you have used them.

We aggregate this information to track services used and/or on-site activityin order to make the site more useful to you. We may provide aggregate statistics about our users, traffic patterns and service and site information to third-parties (such as vendors, advertisers and our business partners), but we will use reasonable efforts to anonymize that information and provide it only in an aggregated form that does not personally identify you.

We may use this information to provide you with tracking information about your own use of Rovi Property as well as your ratings, preferences and what content you like or dislike on Rovi Property.

**Advertising**

We may use your personal information and non-personal information to serve ads to you via Rovi Property as well as to provide you with promotions, products and services. We may also use third-party advertising companies and other business partners to serve ads on Rovi Property and provide you with promotions, products and services. These third-party advertising companies and our business partners may be located throughout the world. 

These third-party advertising companies and business partners may receive anonymous information about you and that information can include: date and time of ad shown, the banner ad that was shown, your IP address and your interactions with the advertisements. These third-party advertising companies and business partners may use cookies, clear GIFs and anonymous information about your visits to Rovi Property and other websites to measure and improve the effectiveness of their ads, promotions, products and services. This information may also be used for online preference and other targeted marketing purposes. The information received by these third-party advertising companies and business partners is subject to the privacy policies of these third-party advertising companies and business partners. We may be given access to this information by these third-party advertising companies and business partners.

_With your consent as indicated when you set up your account_ , we may make certain information about you (including personal information) available to third-party advertising companies and other business partners under agreements between us and those third-party advertising companies and business partners. The third-party advertising companies and business partners will use that information to target advertising to you or provide and market promotions, products and services to you. You may withdraw your consent to our providing your personal information to advertising companies and business partners at any time by adjusting your preferences in the preference page of the relevant Rovi Property. If you do so we will not provide your personal information from the relevant Rovi Property to third party advertisers or business partners from the time you opt out. However we may still provide them with anonymised or aggregated information from which they may send you targeted advertisements.

**_SECURITY_**

We use commercially reasonable efforts to safeguard the confidentiality of your personally identifiable information. However, due to the design of the Internet, ever-changing technology and other factors outside of our control, we cannot guarantee that communications between you and our servers will be free from unauthorized access by third parties. We will have no liability for disclosure of personally identifiable information due to errors in transmission or unauthorized or unlawful acts of third parties.

**_COMMITMENT TO CHILDRENS PRIVACY_**

Protecting the privacy of children is important to us. For that reason, none of our Rovi Properties are directed at anyone under 13 and they are not structured specifically to attract anyone under 13. We also do not collect or maintain personally identifiable information from those users who we actually know are under 13. Should we learn or be notified that we have collected information from users under the age of 13, we will immediately delete such personally identifiable information.

**_CHANGING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION & PREFERENCES_**

**Your Right to Choose**  
When you register to access certain Rovi Properties, you can let us know that you do not wish to receive announcements from us by opting out at the time you give us your personally identifiable information. You may also later opt out of providing us personal identifiable information by changing your preferences in the set up areas of the Rovi Properties or changing the necessary settings in your profile. For certain Rovi Properties opting out may only be possible if you delete your account for that Rovi Property. If you opt out or do not provide your personal information then some services and features (such as personal information services, recommendations and tracking of ratings and likes and dislikes) may not be available to you. All newsletters and email announcements from us will contain an unsubscribe link that also allows you to opt out at any time.
