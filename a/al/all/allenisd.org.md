# Finance & Operations / Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act: Notice of Release of Informati

**Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA)**

 **Notice of Release of Information**

F _amily Educational Rights and Privacy Act_ (FERPA), a Federal law, requires a child’s parent or guardian to provide written consent prior to the disclosure of personally identifiable information from a child’s education records. The information also may be disclosed pursuant to a court order. The court, in _Texas Taxpayer and Student Fairness Coalition v. Robert Scott, et. al._ has issued a protective order requiring the Texas Education Agency (TEA) to provide records regarding all public school students in Texas for the 2005-2006 through the 2011-2012 school years to attorneys representing school districts, students and parents in the lawsuit and that the records be kept secure. TEA is providing the records in compliance with that order. **The records WILL NOT INCLUDE student names, addresses, social security numbers, unique identifying identification numbers, the student’s date of birth or any other individually identifying information.** The information includes information on standardized test performance, graduation plans, and participation in educational programs such as bilingual education or special education. The information will be used only by the attorneys and their consulting and testifying experts, and anyone who has access to the data is prohibited from attempting to use it to identify individual students. **The information will not be used for any other purpose.**

TEA is providing the information to attorneys representing the school districts on June 15, 2012. If you do not want TEA to include information from your or your child’s education records in the production, you must file an objection in the 250th District Court of Travis County, Judge John Dietz, presiding, by June 13, 2012 at 5 p.m. and provide the reason/s why your child’s information should not be included in the production.
