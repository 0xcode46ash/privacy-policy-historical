# Allied Electronics - On Line Privacy Practices

**General**  
While visiting the Allied Electronics site, we may ask you to register and/or provide information that personally identifies you ("Personal Information") for purposes of interacting with our site, including, for example, when you ask for information, enter a contest, order subscriptions, or download material. Allied intends to give you as much control as possible over your Personal Information. If you choose to provide Allied with your Personal Information, it is our intent to let you know how we will use your Personal Information. Allied uses your Personal Information to help you quickly find goods, services or information on the site. We track the domains from which this site is visited and use that data to analyze for trends and statistics, and then discard it. If you choose not to have your Personal Information used as a basis for further contact with you by Allied or one of its business partners, you may "opt out". If you choose not to give us your Personal Information, you can still use most of this site. You merely will not be able to access areas that require registration. Additionally, if you do not want Allied to send you e-mail or postal mail regarding Allied or its services, you may "opt out" at the time you give us your Personal Information. 

**Links to Other Materials**  
If any link is offered connecting to a third party website, it is as an accommodation to the respective third party site owner and without charge. Sites linked to and from this site are not necessarily under the control of Allied and Allied shall have no responsibilities or liabilities whatsoever for the content or privacy practices of any such linked site or any link or linking program at any time. Allied does not necessarily endorse companies (or related products or services) to or from which this site is linked. If you decide to access any of the third party sites linked to this site, you do so entirely at your own risk. Allied hereby disclaims any rights to trademarks, service marks, tradenames, logos, copyrights, patents, domain names or other intellectual property interests of third parties. 

**"Cookies"**  
There is a technology called "cookies" which can be used to provide you with tailored information from a website. A cookie is an element of data that a website can send to your browser, which may then store it on your system. Some Allied pages may use cookies so that we may better serve you when you return to our site. You can set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether to accept it. 

This website uses a **session cookie** to enable e-commerce functionality. When you enter the Allied website, a cookie is sent to your browser. **The cookie is stored by your browser, but is not written to your hard disk**. This cookie contains a number generated by the Allied web server. It is used to uniquely identify your browser for the duration of your visit to the Allied site. **This cookie is not used to gather information about your visit to the Allied site. The cookie is simply used to link you to your unique order.**

This cookie is similar to a locker key in that, as you interact with our site (add an item to your shopping cart), information is stored for you in a locker on the Allied server. The cookie is the key to this locker and the information contained within. Because this key is unique to you, it ensures that your information is secured and cannot be accessed by anyone else. 

**When you quit your browser or after 30 minutes of inactivity, the cookie within your browser and the corresponding data, including your shopping cart, on the Allied server will be deleted and your session ended.**

**Site Technologies**  
Allied does not provide the technologies used to build its site, and therefore neither recommends nor endorses the same. Any information regarding identified technologies, their capabilities, limitations, applications, etc., should be sought directly from their manufacturers. Allied hereby disclaims any rights to trademarks, service marks, tradenames, logos, copyrights, patents, domain names or other intellectual property interests of third parties. 

If you have any questions or comments about our privacy practices, and the use of cookies, please send email to:
