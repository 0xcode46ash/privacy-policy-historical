# allAfrica.com: Privacy Policy

AllAfrica Global Media

Privacy Policy

AllAfrica is committed to respecting and protecting the privacy of those who use allAfrica.com. This statement outlines how we handle any personal information we obtain.

From time to time, we may ask for information that personally identifies you, as in user surveys or orders placed through our site. We use this information to operate this site, provide you with the highest quality services and offer you opportunities we think will be of interest.

You also may choose to provide personal information by participating in various forums we intend to offer for readers. You should remember that when you yourself voluntarily disclose personal information to other Internet users, such as when you include personal information in a posting to an online discussion forum, that information could be used by others and may result in unsolicited messages or other forms of attention.

We use IP addresses to analyze traffic and administer this site. IP addresses track individual computers and do not contain personally identifiable data. 

In order to describe our services to prospective partners, advertisers and others, we may disclose user information, but only in a form that does not identify individual users. For example, we might disclose that a certain percentage of our users are female or within a certain age range. 

E-Commerce

When AllAfrica.com offers items for sale, information is collected to process the orders and is used only for that purpose. It is not sold to other vendors. We also host or provide links to advertisers, sponsors and online stores that sell a variety of goods and services. These vendors may ask you for information such as your name and credit card number. AllAfrica does not collect, use or disclose this information, nor does it own or control the vendors or have responsibility for transactions made by those merchants. If you would like to know more about the information collected when you participate in e-commerce through this site, please contact the merchants directly.

Cookies

A "cookie" is a small data text file that can be placed in your browser to enable a server to recognize you each time you visit this site. Cookies may be placed on reader's computers from time to time by AllAfrica or its advertisers.

Cookies themselves do not contain any personal information. AllAfrica does not use cookies to collect personal information. Instead, they may sometimes be used to track which parts of our site you have used so that we can better serve you when you return. Cookies may be used to provide you with information and special opportunities tailored to your interests. Our advertisers may use cookies to determine or control how many times you see their message or to customize the message you are presented.

Third Party Ad Serving

AllAfrica works with several third parties which serve ads to this site. Some of the advertising displayed on our site is delivered by AdForce, LLC. In the course of serving ads, AdForce collects certain non-personally identifiable data by placing a cookie on a consumer's computer hard drive. The non-personally identifiable information collected in connection with a cookie includes:

* date a particular ad was served  
* time a particular ad was served  
* advertisement tag (placed by a website on a web page to call up an ad).  
  
This information is used by AdForce to deliver tailored ads to you and in the aggregate for statistical purposes. We use this information for reporting purposes and to bill our advertisers. Please note that AdForce cannot collect any personal information about you (such as your name, address, phone number or email address) when it delivers ads to our website.

In the course of serving advertisements to this site, DoubleClick may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser. They may use information (not including your name, address, email address, or telephone number) about your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements on this and other sites about goods and services of interest to you.
