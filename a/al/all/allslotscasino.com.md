We collect personal information about you when you use any of the Casinos, make customer/player inquires, register for information or other services, or when you respond to communications from us (such as questionnaires or surveys). Personal information includes information that can identify you as a specific individual, such as your name, address, phone number, credit card information or email address. Although you are required to enter your personal information in order to access and play at the Casinos, participate in the contests and complete any financial transactions, many areas of the Casino websites can be accessed without providing any personal information. In addition to the foregoing, we routinely gather information on the various Casino websites, including data on the number of unique visitors, where they come from, how long they stay, which banner(s) they have clicked on to arrive at a Casino, which games they prefer to play, etc. This information is collected on an aggregate, anonymous basis and no personal information is associated with this data. The foregoing notwithstanding, we may have to collect certain personal information if you’ve arrived through an affiliate site to compensate the affiliate. 

When you register on one of the Casinos, we reserve the right to send you a permanent cookie. A cookie is a small file that can be placed on your computer’s hard drive for record-keeping purposes. Cookies help us recognize you when you next visit the Casino and note the advertisements you’ve clicked on, the games you’ve played and other sites that you’ve entered via a link from the Casino. The purpose of a cookie is to assist us in tailoring the services we provide to you based on your historical preferences. You are not obliged to accept a cookie from us or from any other website. We reserve the right, however, to refuse or limit access to any of our websites and/or Casinos unless you accept the use of a cookie or similar device. 

We use the information you provide about yourself when registering to provide you with: (i) a casino account, (ii) a casino account number, (iii) access to the Casino, including the processing of your payment transactions, (iv) customer support services, (v) information about our other services and products, and (vi) information about other partner’s similar products and promotions that may be of interest to you. Your personal information may be shared with our employees, independent contractors, agents or other related entities and/or business partners acting on our behalf. We will not share this information with non-partner companies except to the extent necessary to complete your transactions. Any time we share such information with non-employees, it is subject to their express agreement to treat your information as confidential, and with the understanding that it may not be used for any purpose other than to perform their duties and obligations to us. In the event we sell all or substantially all of our assets in connection with a business reorganization or bankruptcy, your personal information may be transferred as well. We may use your personal information to contact you about changes to your account or to validate a transaction. We also reserve the right to release your personal information when we believe that releasing is appropriate to comply with applicable laws and regulations, to enforce or apply our Casino Terms and Conditions, or to protect the rights, property or safety of Nexigames, our Casino players or others. 

As a registered user, you expressly agree that we have the right to send you emails and other forms of notifications and messages (e.g., postal mail notifications, telephone calls, etc.) about special promotions, surveys, contests, bonuses, sweepstakes and newsletters.

All transactions, for example, pass through Secure Socket Layer 3.0 technology to ensure your data is protected. The security of your personal information is of utmost importance to us, and we strive to ensure its security through encryption and other measures implemented on our systems. However, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be completely secure, and we cannot guarantee the security of the personal information you transmit to us. You transmit such information at your own risk. We will continue to assess, update and improve our systems to provide you with additional protection for your personal information.
