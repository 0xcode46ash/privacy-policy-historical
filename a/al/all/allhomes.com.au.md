From May 2014, allhomes will have disaster recovery support including use of servers physically located in a data centre in Hong Kong. Information that allhomes collects is backed up to, stored on, and retrieved from, those servers. 

Also, allhomes’ electronic mail capability is provided by Google, and email is stored on Google’s servers. Google has data centres in the United States, Finland, Belgium, Taiwan, Singapore, and Ireland. Any personal or other information contained in email will be stored in a data centre in one or more of those countries. 

Any overseas disclosure does not affect our commitment to safeguarding your personal or other information. Where reasonable in the circumstances, our contracts with overseas recipients oblige them to comply with the APPs and the Act. However, you acknowledge that, in agreeing to the disclosure of your information to overseas recipients, we will no longer be required to take reasonable steps to ensure overseas recipients’ compliance with the APPs in relation to your information and we will not be liable to you for any breach of the APPs by those overseas recipients. On this basis, you consent to such disclosure. 

## How is my personal and other information kept secure?

We take reasonable steps to protect your personal information from misuse, interference, loss and unauthorised access, modification and disclosure. Such steps include: physical security over paper-based and electronic data storage and premises; computer and network security measures, including use of firewalls, password access and secure servers; restricting access to your personal information to employees and those acting on our behalf who are authorised and on a 'need to know' basis; retaining your personal information for no longer than it is reasonably required, unless we are required by law to retain it for longer; and entering into confidentiality agreements with staff and third parties. 

Allhomes uses a hosting provider for the storage of its information. The hosting provider uses a primary server room in Canberra and a secondary server room in Sydney. From May 2014, allhomes’ hosting provider’s primary server room will be in Sydney and its secondary server room will be in Hong Kong. Secure access to physical servers is controlled by allhomes’ hosting provider. Access to the information stored on the servers is protected by username/password authentication authorisation schemes. 

Data transmissions between allhomes’ servers and its hosting provider’s servers is encrypted using Secure Sockets Layer ("SSL") security mechanisms. 

Allhomes uses network vulnerability testers to ensure the security of its data. Allhomes also uses monitoring devices within its network infrastructure to notify of incursion or attempted incursion. 

Where we no longer require your personal information, including where we are no longer required by law to keep records relating to you, we will ensure that it is de-identified or destroyed. 

## Data quality:

We take reasonable steps to ensure that your personal information is accurate, complete and up-to-date. However, we rely on you to advise us of any changes or corrections to the information we hold about you.

If you believe that personal information we hold about you is incorrect, incomplete or not current, you may request that we update or correct your information by contacting us. We will deal with your request within a reasonable time. If we do not agree with the corrections you have requested (for example, because we consider that the information is already accurate, up‑to‑date, complete, relevant and not misleading), we are not required to make the corrections. However, where we refuse to do so, we will give you a written notice setting out the reasons.
