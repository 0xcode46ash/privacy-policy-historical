**ABOUT CHILDREN**

**  
INFORMATION COLLECTION AND USE.**

"Personally identifying information", or just personal information, includes your name, home or other address (like your school), e-mail address, telephone number, or any other info that tells another person who you are. Our site may use order forms and registration forms for users to request Alloy information, products and services. We may collect contact info (like e-mail address, name, address and phone number) and financial information (like credit card number) through these forms. Contact info from the forms is used to send orders to our customers, to send information about our products and services and for purposes of record keeping. Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings and are given the opportunity to do so each time you register or order online. We may send you e-mail notices about products, companies and events that we think might interest you. At any time you can change your user information. [Click here to edit your profile](https://shop.alloy.com/user/account/myaccount.asp). In addition, we make information available to selected companies who have services, products and offers that we also think might interest you. If you do not want to receive these messages, email us at [myinfo@alloymail.com](mailto:myinfo@alloymail.com). We make an effort to include a link to this Privacy Policy wherever we ask you for personal information. Below are more details about the information Alloy.com gathers from you and how we use it: 

**  
Cookies**. We try to provide you with services, products and offers customized to your interests. In order to do that, we use "cookies" to keep and sometimes track information about you. A "cookie" is a small piece of data that is sent to your browser from a Web server and stored on your computer's hard drive. We use cookies to: access your account information (stored on our computers) in order to deliver better and more personalized services; estimate our audience size for our advertisers; assist in processing items in your shopping basket; track the number of entries in our promotions, sweepstakes and contests; and identify which areas of our site you have visited. We may also match information obtained from cookies with data provided by you or collected by third parties. We analyze this data both in the aggregate (like, half of our users are guys) and in connection with individual users (like, Joe Cool visits Alloy Sports the most). This information lets us give you the services you want that are connected with your interests. We also provide the analysis of our users (as a group, of course) to prospective partners, advertisers and other third parties. 

You can opt to have your browser reject cookies. If you do that, you'll need to re-register with Alloy every time you visit our site in order to participate in certain promotions and other stuff. You should also know that companies that advertise on our site may use their own cookies. This privacy policy does not cover how these companies use their cookies. 

**Alloy Surveys and Polls**. In order to gather information about our audience, Alloy conducts surveys and polls of our users from time to time. These surveys and polls are sometimes asked on behalf of a particular client, sometimes for a bunch of clients, or sometimes just for fun. Any data we collect from the survey is edited before we release it to a client. We may be paid for some or all of this survey data. All surveys are optional and any prizes offered for participating in an Alloy Survey are awarded based on a random drawing. 

When you participate in a survey, you are completely anonymous. Your answers are immediately separated from your personal information. We only ask for name and email in order to award random prizes. If you do give us your name or e-mail address in some section of the form where it wasn't supposed to be included, we will delete it before releasing the data outside Alloy.com. 

The survey reports we send out to clients will include aggregated data, like 80% of the boys said X and 64% of the girls said Y. If we ask you for a zip code it is only so that we can compare likes and dislikes and attitudes from all different parts of our Alloy.com membership. We will not participate in any survey initiative on behalf of a client which will not protect your privacy. 

**  
Promotions**. We may ask you for personally identifiable information at other times, including, but not limited to, when you enter sweepstakes, contests or promotions sponsored by us or a third party. If you don't want your information collected by us or these third parties, you can decide not to participate in the promotion, contest or sweepstakes. 

**  
E-zine** Alloy offers a weekly ezine to its users. Only users age 13 or older are allowed to subscribe to the ezine. On occasion, we disclose the email addresses of our ezine subscribers to a contractor in order to deliver our ezine. If you want to update your email address or stop receiving the newsletter, follow the procedures to unsubscribe at the bottom of any ezine we send you or contact us at [myinfo@alloymail.com.](mailto:myinfo@alloy.com)

**  
Other Third Parties**. Alloy.com may share non-personal, aggregate, or summary, information regarding our users with other third parties not mentioned in this policy. This kind of information does not identify you individually. 

**  
Legal Authorities**. We may disclose user information to government authorities at our discretion. We also may disclose user information when we have reason to believe that someone is causing injury to or interference with our rights or property, other Alloy users, or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities. 

**  
Business Transfer**. In the event that Alloy Online, Inc. or substantially all of its assets are acquired by a third party, customer information will be one of the transferred assets. 

**  
OTHER ALLOY SERVICES**

**  
Chat Rooms, Voice Chat and Message Boards**. You must be age 13 or older to use the Alloy chat rooms, voice chat and message boards. Although Alloy reserves the right to monitor Chat Rooms, Voice Chat sessions, and Message Boards we will not be able to do so all of the time. **

REMEMBER - DO NOT DISCLOSE PERSONAL INFORMATION IN CHAT ROOMS, THROUGH VOICE CHAT OR ON MESSAGE BOARDS. WHENEVER YOU DO SO, ALL OF THAT INFORMATION CAN BE COLLECTED AND USED BY OTHERS. IF YOU POST PERSONAL INFO IN PUBLIC PLACES, OTHERS MAY SEND YOU UNSOLICITED E-MAIL MESSAGES. BE CAREFUL AND BE SMART WITH YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION.

**

**  
Alloy Auctions**. In order to participate in Alloy Auctions, you will be providing personal information to third parties. That information includes any information you provide to us or other users during the registration, bidding or listing process, in any public message area (including the feedback area) or through any email feature. When you are participating in Alloy Auctions, you are solely responsible for personal information, and we act as a passive conduit for your online distribution and publication of all of this personal information. You are asked for this information only for the purposes of participating in the auction, so that the seller can send you whatever it is that you purchased online. But, Sellers participating in Alloy Auctions could be individual people or other businesses - all third parties unrelated to Alloy - and we don't have any idea what they might do with your personal information once it's given to them for the purpose of getting the stuff that you're paying them for. **

REMEMBER, YOU ARE PROVIDING PERSONAL INFORMATION HERE TO TOTAL STRANGERS \- INDIVIDUALS OR OTHER BUSINESSES. WE DON'T HAVE ANY CONTROL OVER THE USES OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION PROVIDED ON ALLOY AUCTIONS, AND YOU SHOULDN'T DO SO WITHOUT FIRST CHECKING WITH YOUR PARENTS

**. 

**  
ACCESS TO OTHER SITES THROUGH ALLOY.COM**

You should be aware that when you are on Alloy.com, you will have the opportunity to visit, or link to, other sites not operated by Alloy.com. These sites, some of whom are Alloy.com advertisers, may collect personally identifiable information about you. Alloy.com does not control sites that are operated by others and is not responsible for the information practices of these sites and this privacy statement does not address the information practices of those web sites or advertisers. 

**  
SECURITY**

We maintain this site and all associated data with technical, administrative and physical safeguards to protect against loss, unauthorized access, destruction, misuse, modification and improper disclosure. However, no computer system or information can ever be fully protected against every possible hazard. But Alloy.com is committed to providing reasonable and appropriate security controls to protect our web sites and their information against foreseeable hazards.
