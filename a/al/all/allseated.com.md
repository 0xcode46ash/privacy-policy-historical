This Website and Services are not intended for use by children.

We reserve the right, however, to limit or deny your request to the extent permitted by applicable law if the disclosure could lead to a breach of applicable law and regulation, such as in case of any legal obligation to retain certain data, or if you have failed to verify your identity to our reasonable satisfaction.

Note that the Services allow users to share information.  You understand and agree that if another User has accessed your Personal Information that you have shared, we cannot change or limit what they do with that information outside of the Website.

#### Use of Cookies

The Website uses cookies (whether of AllSeated or of third parties) to help you personalize your online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and generally can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.

One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide convenience features to save you time. For instance, a cookie can be set to tell the web server that you have returned to a specific page. In the case of the Website, if you updated details related to an Event, or register with the Website for different Events and/or Services, a cookie helps AllSeated to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of recording your information such as IP addresses, username and so on. When you return to the Website, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the Website features that you customized.

Some content or applications, including advertisements, on the Website are served by third parties, including advertisers, ad networks and servers, content providers and application providers. These third parties may use cookies alone or in conjunction with web beacons or other tracking technologies to collect information about you when you use our Website. The information they collect may be associated with your online activities over time and across different websites and other online services. They may use this information to provide you with interest-based (behavioral) advertising or other targeted content.

You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of the Services provided in the Website or other websites you visit.

#### Security of Personal Information

AllSeated reasonably secures your Personal Information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure, and maintains such information on computer servers in an industry standard controlled and secured environment. AllSeated’s databases on which your data (including Personal Information) is stored are reasonably secured and programmed for protection from unauthorized access to or use of such data and/or Personal Information.

#### Changes to this Privacy Policy

AllSeated may update this Privacy Policy from time to time.  All updates will be posted on this page, with the date when updated noted below.
