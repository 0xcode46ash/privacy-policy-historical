# Alliance Health Networks - Privacy Policy

Alliance Health has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for Alliance Health.

  * We do not disclose your private online communications.
  * We do not use any information about where you personally navigate on Alliance Health or the Web, and we do not give it out to others.
  * We use secure technology, privacy protection controls, and restrictions on employee access in order to safeguard your personal information.

### How Does Alliance Health Use Registration Information?

Alliance Health’s registration forms require users to give us contact information ( e.g., name, e-mail address, phone number, and physical address) and demographic information (e.g., gender, age, and insurance carrier). We use this information from the registration form to contact users according to their requests, and to further fulfill requests, as well as to send our users information about our website.

Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings; see the choice/opt-out section below. Demographic and profile data is also collected during registration. We use this data to tailor the user’s experience at Alliance Health, displaying content that we think they might be interested in, and displaying the content according to their preferences. This information is occasionally shared with advertisers on an aggregate basis.

### Special Cases

Alliance Health may also disclose account information in special cases when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal action against someone who may be violating Alliance Health’s Terms of Use.

The same policy applies in cases where we believe an individual may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) Alliance Health’s rights or property, other Alliance Health users, or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities.

Alliance Health may disclose or access account information when we believe in good faith that the law requires it and for administrative and other purposes that we deem necessary to maintain, service, and improve our products and services. Alliance Health may also display entity names as part of the registration process to facilitate an individual registrant’s affiliation with the correct entity.

### Choice/Opt-Out

Alliance Health provides users the opportunity to opt-out of receiving communications from us at any time by emailing us at support@cirrusdata.com. Please put Unsubscribe in the subject line and body of the email.

### How does Alliance Health use cookies and the IP address information?

We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer our website. Your IP address is used to gather broad demographic information.

We use cookies for application functions, login purposes and to deliver content on our Web site that is specific to your interests, but we do not use information from cookies for any marketing purposes, nor do we make that information available to third parties.

The cookie does not track any personal information about you, provide us with any way to contact you, or extract any information from your computer.

We hope you will want the better service that cookies provide, but you may set your browser to refuse cookies. However, by doing so, you will not be able to successfully use this service.

### How does Alliance Health work with other companies and how do these relationships affect user privacy?

Alliance Health contains links to other sites. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such web sites.

Certain products and services marketed through Alliance Health are made available by patner companies with which Alliance Health has a strategic alliance. To obtain these products and services you may be required to visit another company’s Web site or a site they share with Alliance Health. When ordering, registering for, or purchasing products or services from these partners, you will be entering into an agreement with that partner, and not with Alliance Health. In these cases, this privacy policy does not apply; instead, the privacy policy of the partner providing the goods or services will apply.

We urge you to read and understand our partners’ policies before entering into agreements with them. We are committed to partnering with companies that share our privacy concerns. Alliance Health, however, cannot control the way these partners collect or use information.

If you have questions about our partners’ privacy policies or the privacy policies of these other sites, we encourage you to contact them directly.

Occasionally we may share information with our sponsors and partners. We will share such information on an aggregate basis and will never reveal information about individual users of the site without consent.

### How does Alliance Health secure information entered by visitors?

We use industry-standard technology to keep your personal information and information you have entered into our site as secure as possible. We also have put in place privacy protection control systems designed to ensure that your personal data remain safe and private.

Each and every Alliance Health employee servicing the website is obligated to abide by this privacy policy. Employees who violate our privacy policies are subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination.

Only authorized Alliance Health employees servicing the website are permitted to have access to your personal information, and such access is limited by need.

### Changes to this Privacy Policy

Alliance Health may amend this policy from time to time.

### A Note to Parents on our Privacy Policy Regarding Children

Alliance Health is very sensitive to privacy issues and we are proud of our longtime commitment to our customers. We are especially careful in any communications with one of our most treasured customers – children and families. We do not collect personal information from children 12 and under and do not make sales to minors. We do not associate cookie data with personal information about children. Alliance Health will not condition a child’s participation in any on-line activity on the child’s disclosure of more personal information than is reasonably necessary to participate in that activity. In order to review any personal information we have about your child or to ask us to delete that information or to stop further use of the information, please email us at support@cirrusdata.com , subject line: Unsubscribe Minor. We urge parents to regularly monitor and supervise their children’s on-line activities.
