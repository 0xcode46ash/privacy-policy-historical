**Recipe request**  
When you subscribe to this feature, we ask for your name and email address and the description of the recipe that you are requesting.

**My Recipe Box / Savings Club**  
When you subscribe to My Recipe Box, you are automatically given a free membership to the AllRecipes Savings Club.

If you have subscribed to My Recipe Box, we may contact you from time to time with news and promotional information. We also make your aggregate information (without any personal identification) available to our business partners in order to obtain information about products, services and offers, which we believe may be useful to you. You always have the ability to change your preference for follow-up contacts by e-mailing us at [thestaff@allrecipes.com](mailto:thestaff@allrecipes.com).

**II. Ordering from the Allrecipes Store**   
Allrecipes and our e-commerce partners, KitchenEtc. and Electricfood.com, are committed to respecting and protecting your privacy. When ordering products from one of our partner sites, information about you is requested on an order form. The information that is collected from you is used to process orders and provide a more personalized shopping experience. Allrecipes does not sell, trade, or rent your personal information to third parties. 

To find out more detailed information regarding our commerce partner's privacy policies, please click on the links provided below: 

[Electricfood.com Privacy Policy](https://web.archive.org/shop/shop.asp?vid=2&v_code=priv)   
[KitchenEtc. Privacy Policy](https://web.archive.org/shop/shop.asp?vid=1&ke_lnkt=10)

**Security & Safety**  
To take the worry out of using your credit card to order through the web, Kitchen Etc. and Electricfood.com both use a Secure Server Technology (SSL), which encrypts your credit card information so that it cannot be read as it travels over the Internet. Which means - the characters are scrambled, making it impossible for a third party to intercept your personal information. 

You can verify that the encryption is working by locating the lock icon at the bottom of the web page. While on a secure page, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, as when you are just 'surfing.' All pages within the Marketplace will show the locked icon on the bottom of each page. To learn more about SSL, follow this link to our encryption software authenticator: www.versign.com. 

**III. Cookies**   
Like most web sites, we use "cookie" technology on our web site. We may place a "cookie" in the browser file of your computer, however the "cookie" itself does not contain any personally identifying information about you. The "cookie" does not track your personal information or provide us with any way to contact you, and the "cookie" does not extract any information off your computer. We use the "cookie" to provide functional information about your browser, allowing us to provide you a better experience. We also use "cookies" to gather broad demographic information and general usage patterns about you and other users of our sites. 

If your browser rejects cookies, you may still use our site. The only drawback to this is that you will be limited from accessing certain areas of our site, such as contests, coupons, recipe box, shopping list feature, etc. 

Some of our business partners also use cookies on our site. See next reference:

**IV. Web Beacons**  
Certain of the pages of our site contain "web beacons" (also known as Internet tags, pixel tags, single-pixel GIFs, clear GIFs, invisible GIFs, 1-by-1 GIFs, and web bugs). These web beacons do not affect the appearance of a page but allow third parties to obtain the following information: the IP address of the computer that downloaded the page on which the beacon appears, the URL of the page on which the beacon appears, the time the page containing the beacon was viewed, the type of browser used to view the page, and the information in cookies set by the third party. Allrecipes does not control or monitor the use of the information collected by third parties through the web beacons placed on the Allrecipes.com Web site. 

**V. DoubleClick**   
DoubleClick is a third-party advertising company we partner with to display the advertisements on our site. These advertisements also contain "cookies." "Cookies" received with DoubleClick's banner ads are collected by DoubleClick and used to provide broad demographic information for better advertisement targeting. Privacy issues surrounding DoubleClick's use of certain non-personally identifiable user information by its technology are discussed in DoubleClick's privacy policy, and are the sole responsibility of DoubleClick. That policy can be viewed on DoubleClick's [Privacy Policy page](http://www.doubleclick.net:8080/privacy_policy/).

**VI. Sonar Network**   
Sonar, a division of DoubleClick, is another third-party advertising company that we partner with to deliver ads to you.

**VII. Log Files**   
Each time an Allrecipes.com page is requested from your browser, we log your computer's IP address into our log files. Your computer has been pre-assigned a 12-digit number. This number is the IP address. We use your IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track your movements on the site, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to any other personally identifiable information by Allrecipes.com. Allrecipes.com does not control or monitor whether third parties with web beacons on the Allrecipes.com Web site have the same policy.

**VIII. Other Sites**   
From time to time we may have links to other websites from our site. We do not control, and therefore cannot be responsible for, the collection, use or disclosure of your information by any such third party site. Please carefully review the privacy policy of any third party site that you link to from our site.
