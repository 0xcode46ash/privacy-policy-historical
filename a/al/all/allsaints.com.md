# Health IT, Inc. Provides e-Business Solutions for the Healthcare Industry

Health IT®, Inc., has a great respect for your privacy. As such, we have posted this page to inform you on what information might be collected about you as you use this website. ****

**What information does Health IT ® receive and why do you collect it?**  
Our website, [www.healthit.com](http://www.healthit.com/), has a statistics package associated with it which enables us to know, for example, the number of visitors to our site without having a counter appear on each page.

We use our statistic package to learn about how folks who visit our site are getting there. With this knowledge we can make web pages so that any web browser can show them to you. To that extent, we learn the following about our visitors: from which state their Internet Service Provider is from (this may not reveal much: everyone using AOL appears to come from West Virginia!), which web browser they use, and from what previous website did they come to ours.

The information we collect would not be able to identify anyone by their name, nor their address or other personal information. We do not look at any "cookies*" stored on computers from our visitors.

****

**What information DO you collect from the website's visitors?  
**The only other information that we collect from you is when you willingly (and knowingly) offer it when you fill out one of our forms. That is the only time when we will know your name (or telephone or address): when you submit it to us.

****

**How do you use the information?**  
Again, the information helps us make a site that is geared towards our future visitors.

****

**What about sharing the information you collect with third parties (for example, with other companies)?  
**It's simple: this doesn’t happen. Any information we collect stays with Health IT®. 

We have a way for visitors to sign up to [join our e-mail list](https://web.archive.org/web/20041206205251id_/http%3A//resources.htm#join) for our newsletter, Health IT Today. When they do, we keep their name and e-mail address so we can send out notices to them. To further protect their privacy we send these e-mails out to those on our list in such a way that folks cannot see who else is on the list.

****

**What about Advertisements?**  
We do not have banner ads for a simple reason -- we don't want them to get in your way of maneuvering around our site.

_Other questions?_ **** Please contact our [administrator](mailto:administrator@healthit.com).
