### Cookies & Web Beacons

Alledia.com, its advertisers or analytics partners may send a cookie to your computer or use web beacons to gather statistical information. 

A cookie does not personally identify you. It is simply a way to know that a particular web browser was used to visit our sites. 

A web beacon does not personally identify you. It is simply a way to automatically send information about pages and content used to an analysis tool. 

Cookies and web beacons allows us to understand things such as whether a particular web browser is spending much time on our sites, visiting several times per month and other types of analysis. 

If you never provide us with personally identifiable information, then your visits - despite us using cookies or web beacons - are anonymous. We don't know the actual person linked with the cookie. 

Browsers can be set to accept or reject cookies or notify you when a cookie is being sent. Privacy software can be used to override web beacons. Taking either of these actions shouldn't cause a problem with our sites, should you so choose. If you do encounter a problem, please let us know.
