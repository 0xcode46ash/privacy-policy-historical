# Alliant Energy - Privacy Policy

**_Last Updated: April 11, 2017_**

Alliant Energy Corporation and its subsidiaries and affiliated companies (also referred to as “Alliant Energy”, "we" or "us") understand the importance you place on the privacy and security of information that personally identifies you or your account. We refer to this information as "personal information." We want you to know what personal information we collect and how we use it. 

We have developed this Privacy Policy to explain how we collect, use and disclose information about you. This Privacy Policy applies to information we collect when you obtain energy service from us, use our Web sites, mobile applications and online services, or interact with us. This policy does not apply to the information we collect from individuals who submit applications for employment through our Web sites or other means. 

We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make changes, we will notify you by revising the date at the top of the policy and, in some cases, we may provide you with additional notice (such as by adding a statement to the home page of our Web sites or by sending you a notification). 

We collect personal information in order to provide you with service and improve your experience.. For example, we collect information when you sign up for service, create an online account, fill out a form, pay your bill, make a purchase, contact customer service, use our mobile applications, communicate with us via third party social media sites or otherwise communicate with us. The types of information we may collect include your name, online account username, email address, postal address, phone number, fax number, Social Security number, income status, date of birth, payment method information and any other information you choose to provide. 

When you obtain energy service from us, we automatically collect energy usage information, including the amount of electricity or gas used and the average use and cost per day. This information facilitates our billing activities and overall provision of energy service.
