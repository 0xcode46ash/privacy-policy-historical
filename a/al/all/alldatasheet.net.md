Alldatasheet.comÂ  is committed to protecting your privacy. This policy explains how we handle information we learn about you while you visit our site. The information that we receive depends on what you do during your visit, and what service(s) you request

Data Collected  
We collect two types of information: personal and demographic. Personal information is any information that you choose to submit to us and that is specific to your identification (i.e. name, address, phone number, email). Demographic information is information that cannot be associated with you personally (i.e. domain information, zip codes, areas of interest). We also keep track of your browsing patterns.

Use of Data  
When you request a service, place an order, submit feedback, or participate in a seminar or survey, it is necessary for you to offer certain personal information about yourself so that we could serve your needs. We will not send you information unless you specifically request it, or we feel that the information would benefit your business needs. If you decide that you do not want to receive further information, simply contact us and request to be removed from the contact list. When you order a sample from us, a customer representative may contact you to follow up. The demographic information that is collected through our site is used to evaluate how our site is used and how it can be improved. It may also be used for marketing and investment analysis.
