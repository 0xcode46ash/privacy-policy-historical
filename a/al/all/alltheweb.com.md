You also have the right to demand access to information about the processing of any personal data about you by AlltheWeb and the nature of the personal data.

This demand should be addressed to the AlltheWeb General Manager, Fast Search & Transfer, 93 Worcester Street, Wellesley, MA 02481, USA. The general manager, at his own initiative, shall rectify deficient personal data if he becomes aware of any such deficiencies.
