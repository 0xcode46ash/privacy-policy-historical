# AllAboutVision.com Privacy Policy

All About Vision's policy is to respect the privacy of visitors to our website. This policy describes how we gather information from our site's visitors and what we do with it.

## How We Collect Information

Our web server automatically recognizes each visitor's domain name, and we collect the domain name of visitors to our website for the purposes of system administration. A domain name does not provide us with personally identifiable information.

You can visit our website without revealing any information about yourself. Our site is not set up to track, collect, or distribute personal information about you (such as name, address, e-mail address, telephone number and product preferences) unless you voluntarily input this information, such as when you sign up to receive our e-mail newsletter, when you ask us to e-mail a friend about this site or when you otherwise voluntarily input this information. Any information you input will be used by us only as described in the "How we use information" section of this statement.

We use electronic records to compile statistics about how collectively our visitors interact with our website. These statistics contain no personal information. **By voluntarily providing us with information about yourself, you are consenting to our use of it in accordance with this policy.**

## How We Use Information

We use the personally identifiable information we collect for internal purposes such as improving our products and services, sending you e-mail (at your request only) about topics you have specified, to show you the categories of banner ads in which you are most likely to be interested and learning about our users' needs.

We may share this information in aggregate form with our advertisers. For example, while we would never say, "Jen Jones wears contact lenses," we might tell our advertisers, "29% of our newsletter readers wear contact lenses."
