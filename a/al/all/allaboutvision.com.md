# AllAboutVision.com Privacy Policy

All About Vision's policy is to respect the privacy of visitors to our website. This policy describes how we gather information from our site's visitors and what we do with it.

## How We Collect Information

Our web server, like all web servers, will automatically recognize each visitor's Internet address (or "IP address"). This does not provide us with personally identifiable information. Our server logs will record page views and the serving of images and other files, and can associate those actions with particular visitor sessions, but this information is not tied to any individual visitor's identity. We use Google Analytics for this same purpose.

You can visit our website without revealing any information about yourself. Our site is not set up to track, collect or distribute personal information about you (such as name, address, e-mail address, telephone number and product preferences) unless you voluntarily provide this information, such as when you ask us to e-mail a friend or you provide this information when you fill out a "contact us" form.

## How We Use Information

We automatically use electronic records to compile statistics about how collectively our visitors interact with our website. These statistics contain no personal information.

On certain pages, you may have the opportunity to provide personally identifiable information. **When you voluntarily provide us with information about yourself, you consent to our use of it in accordance with this policy**.

We use the personally identifiable information only for clearly stated purposes. For example, we may use your email address to respond to a question you have sent us. We never add email addresses to lists for purposes of additional communication, unless you have asked us to. **Your personally identifiable information will be provided to third parties only at your request**. Examples of this include but are not limited to: (1) We may provide your medical question to a doctor for a response; (2) If you use a feedback form in an advertising section, the information will be sent to the advertiser; (3) If you provide your personal information for purposes of a product rebate or value-added service, it will be provided to a third party for fulfillment.

We may share this information in aggregate form with our advertisers, but we never supply without your permission personal information such as: "Jen Jones wears contact lenses."

Unless otherwise required by law or if pertinent to a judicial or governmental investigation, personally identifiable information is not shared with other organizations or persons. Should we ever need to make an exception, we will say so at the point where you are giving the information.

Information submitted or provided to us by a website user or any person or entity regarding us or our products or services, including but not limited to ideas for new products or services or modifications to existing products or services, shall be deemed to be non-confidential, and we shall be free to reproduce, use, disclose and distribute such information to others without limitation or attribution.

  * **Cookies.** Cookies are small text files that websites store on your computer's hard drive. When they are supplied from our site, they may contain information you have given us and are intended to be a convenience to you. They may enable the functionality of certain interactive features. They also may anonymously record how often you visit our website, or what pages you looked at.

  AllAboutVision.com cookies only store personally identifying information that you have provided to us. They are not capable of obtaining additional personally identifying information.

  * **Children.** We are very concerned about protecting the children who use our site. We never share with outside companies the personally identifying information that children provide, and use it only for the stated purpose, such as contacting the winner of a children's contest.

  In some cases we require a parent's written permission for children under 13 to participate in surveys or contests. In cases where we would normally post a person's first name on our site (such as a contest winner), we will choose a false name for any child under 18, if a parent asks us to do so.




## Third Party Advertising

Some ads on our site are served by third-party advertising companies. These companies may use information about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements on this site, other sites, and other interactive media about goods and services that may be of interest to you. [This page](http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp) has more information about that practice and your choices relative to targeted advertising.

## Other Websites

You have the opportunity to access other sites from AllAboutVision.com, by clicking either on a site's link or on an advertisement. Please be aware that these sites are outside the control of Access Media Group LLC, and that their privacy policies are likely to differ from ours. We suggest contacting these sites for relevant information about their data collection.
