Privacy on the Internet has been a front page story for almost as long as the web has existed and we think it's an important issue. Here at AllLotto.com and other sites created by AllSites.com, Inc., we take your privacy very seriously. We offer you the details of our policy: 

First, because we are an advertising supported publisher, we do need to know something about our website visitors. Information like your gender, age, income or where you live helps us to find advertisers who want to show you their products. In reality, this information is grouped with that from other visitors, so that advertisers can understand what kind of people visit our site. Not who each person is. 

We gather this information in several ways, all of which involve you typing that information into a form on our site. **If you don't want to share this information, then don't sign our guest book, or register for our services, or contests**. This will ensure that your information will remain private. 

**We do want you to register with us, so here's why it's O.K:**

1\. We will never sell your name, address or email address to any other companies. In most cases we don't even ask your name or address, so don't worry. 

2\. We promise not to email you, unless you allow us to. When we do emailings, to willing receipients, it will be handled by AllSites.com, Inc. No outside companies will be given your address! 

3\. When you do provide data via our website, we will remove that data on a timely basis, usually every week, from our web server. This will help prevent hackers, crackers or simple programming errors from displaying your data. While we can't guarantee that our security is perfect (no one's is!), we do feel that this is a responsible way for us to handle private information. 

So, feel free to sign a guest book, sign up for a contest or register for our products, we value your privacy as much as our own. 

If you have any questions or comments, email us: [privacy@allfree.com](mailto:privacy@allfree.com)
