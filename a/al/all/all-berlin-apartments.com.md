# Privacy Statement of Oh-Berlin.com (Open House Spain S.L.)

Oh-Berlin.com obtains users' information at different points throughout our website. We capture details of both users who make bookings and those who register on the website to obtain information, as well as of the accommodation owners. This personal data will be stored within a file held by Oh-Berlin.com. The user is expected to provide true, exact, complete and current information. 

**Forms**

We request personal information on our accommodation booking form and owner’ registration form, as well as on the users’ sign-up form. A user must provide contact information (such as name, email address, passport number and address) and in some cases financial information (such as credit card number, expiry date). This information is used for billing purposes and to fulfill the user’s requests. If we have problems processing a booking, we use the information to contact the user. Additionally, we use the information for the purposes of commercial communications related to the services provided by Oh-Berlin.com. Both users who book through Oh-Berlin.com’s website and users who register on the website give their express consent to receive such email communications. 

When a client books accommodation through our website, we share personal information such as name, email address, passport number, age, gender and contact details with the owner of the apartment. We encourage you to contact the owner regarding the use of your personal information. The information we collect is used for booking purposes, to notify you of your reservation status and to ask for feedback about your stay and is not shared with any third party which is not directly involved in the booking process. All credit card processing is done by Oh-Berlin.com.
