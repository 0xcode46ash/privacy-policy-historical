#### 7\. Security

This Web site takes every precaution to protect our users' information.   
When users submit sensitive information via the Web site, their information   
is protected both online and off-line. 

When our booking form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as   
credit card number), that information is encrypted and is protected by the   
best encryption software in the industry - SSL (128 bit encryption). While   
on a secure page, such as our booking form, the lock icon on the bottom   
of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer   
becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when users are just  
'surfing'.   
To learn more about SSL, follow this link: [www.webopedia.com/TERM/S/SSL.html](http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/S/SSL.html)

While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also   
do everything in our power to protect user-information off-line. All of our   
users' information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is   
restricted in our offices. Our employees must use password-protected screen-  
savers when they leave their desk. When they return, they must re-enter their   
password to re-gain access to user information. Furthermore, ALL employees are   
kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. Any time new policies are   
added, our employees are notified and/or reminded about the importance we   
place on privacy, and what they can do to ensure our users' information is protected. 

If users have any questions about the security at our Web site, users can send an   
email to [info@all-berlin-apartments.com](mailto:info@all-berlin-apartments.com).

#### 8\. Notification of Changes

If we decide to make a material change to our privacy policy, we will notify   
users by posting a prominent notice on our Web site for 30 days. Our users   
are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under   
what circumstances if any, we disclose it. We will use information in   
accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected.

#### 9\. Notification of changes of personal dates

If a user's personally identifiable information changes (such as zip code, phone,   
email or postal address), or if a user no longer desires our service, we provide   
a way to correct, update or delete/deactivate users' personally identifiable   
information. This can usually be done by emailing our Customer Support   
at [info@all-berlin-apartments.com](mailto:info@all-berlin-apartments.com) or contact us by telephone or postal mail
