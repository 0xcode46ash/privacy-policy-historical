# Allen Edmonds Privacy Policy

### **Security Guarantee**

We guarantee that every transaction with AllenEdmonds.com will be 100% safe. This means you pay nothing if any unauthorized charges are applied to your credit card as a result of shopping with us.

[ ](https://www.scanalert.com/RatingVerify?ref=www.allenedmonds.com)

Our secure server software (SSL) is the industry standard and one of the best ways to secure commerce transactions. SSL encrypts all of your personal information, including credit card number, name and address, so that it cannot be read as the information travels over the internet. Independent third parties scan AllenEdmonds.com daily to ensure security and certify our website is PCI compliant.

Under the Fair Credit Billing Act, your bank cannot hold you liable for more than $50.00 of fraudulent charges. If your bank does hold you liable for any of this amount, AllenEdmonds.com will cover the entire liability for you up to the full $50.00.

We will cover this liability only if the unauthorized use of your credit card happened through no fault of your own from purchases made at AllenEdmonds.com while using the secure server. In the event of unauthorized use of your credit card, you must notify your credit card provider in accordance with that company’s reporting rules and procedures.

### **Privacy Policy**

At Allen Edmonds, we are committed to respecting your privacy and recognizing your need for appropriate protection and management of your personal information. Personal information means any information by which you can be contacted or identified, such as your name, mailing address, email address, telephone number, etc. The information you share with us will not be shared or sold for use by anyone outside of our company and trusted partners performing activities on our behalf. Occasionally we may participate with a trusted cooperative database services partner. These services help us to direct print catalogs, mailings and other marketing initiatives to appropriate purchasers and website visitors. Names and mailing addresses may be shared between participating parties in the cooperative database services, but no credit card information or email addresses are provided to the cooperative. Information gathered on the site is used for fulfilling your order; analyzing preferences, trends and statistics; informing you of new products, services and offers; and tailoring your site experience on AllenEdmonds.com. We may use that information to link to and issue anonymous cookies containing demographic or intent-based data for online behavioral advertising purposes. Such cookies do not contain personally identifiable information.
