## Information Collection and Management

Scrubs AC, Inc. collects information from Visitors and Customers who access the various parts of our Services. Our primary goal in collecting personal information is to provide our visitors with a superior customized online experience. Among other things, we use customer contact information to fill orders, contact prior purchasers to inform them of their order status, and to send service and promotional emails. Promotional emails may be sent from any one or more of our brands, including allheart, allheartchefs and Jasco Uniform, plus other brands that we may market or acquire.

In order to better provide you with numerous products and services, each of our Sites collects Personally Identifiable Information about its visitors.

Personally Identifiable Information might include your name, mailing address, telephone number, mobile phone number, email address, credit card and billing information, profession, gender, and other identification and contact information.
