The Company will never store your personal information directly as a cookie. If, as you log in, you tick the checkbox labelled "Remember me", a persistent cookie will be set. Persistent cookies are not deleted when you close your browser, and will allow the Internet Site to recognise you on your next visit. 

**does the Company use Cookies?**

Advanced features of the site use Cookies to provide information you requested and to reduce you having to key in repeated fields.

When you visit our site, we may also log your IP address, a unique identifier for your connection at a point in time.

The Company also includes web beacons (also known as clear GIFs or web bugs) in its emails to track the success of its marketing campaigns. This means that if you open an email from the Company it can see which pages of the Internet Site you visit. 

**Credit References.**

In assessing your application for credit, to prevent fraud, to check your identity and to prevent money laundering, the Company may search the files of credit reference agencies who will record any credit searches on your file. The Company may also disclose details of how you conduct your account to such agencies. The information will be used by other credit grantors for making credit decisions about you and the people with whom you are financially associated, for fraud prevention, money laundering prevention and occasionally for tracing debtors. Information used for these purposes will include publicly available information such as electoral roll, county court judgments, bankruptcy orders or repossessions.

The Company may also share your information with its business partners in the travel, property, automotive, financial services, leisure, entertainment, advertising, media, retail and mail order business for marketing purposes or it may send you information about other organisations’ goods and services. The Company or its business partners may contact you by mail, telephone, fax, e-mail or other electronic messaging service with offers of goods and services or information that may be of interest to you e.g. holidays, cars, property, financial and leisure services, entertainment, media products, advertising, clothing or household goods. By providing the Company with your fax number, land line and/or mobile telephone numbers or email address you consent to being contacted by these methods for these purposes.
