# Privacy Policy - Allmenus.com

GrubHub, Inc. ("GrubHub") collects certain information through its websites and mobile sites, located at [www.GrubHub.com](http://www.grubhub.com/), [www.allmenus.com](http://www.allmenus.com/), and its blog, located at <http://blog.grubhub.com/> ("The Daily Grub") (the "Sites"), as well as DeliveryHub and the OrderHub (the "Applications")(collectively, "Services"). Your privacy is important to GrubHub and this Privacy Policy lays out GrubHub's policies and procedures surrounding the collection and handling of such information. This Privacy Policy applies only to the Services. It does not apply to any restaurant sites, other third party services linked to GrubHub Services or offline activities related to GrubHub services. 

  1. **Information GrubHub Collects**

GrubHub may collect the following information from users of our Services: first name, last name, street address, city, state, zip code, cross streets, phone number, e-mail address, Services-specific display name, GPS location (mobile site), electronic signature and credit card information (collectively, "Personally Identifiable Information" or "PII"). GrubHub is not intended for use by children under the age of 13 and GrubHub does not knowingly collect PII from children under the age of 13. Use of Sites services requires that you register and/or create an account ("Account") or use the Sites as a guest. In addition to the PII set forth above, GrubHub may collect information regarding Account holders' past GrubHub orders, favorite restaurants, customer service inquiries, service/restaurant reviews and certain social networking preferences relating to the Sites (e.g. pages or entities you like, recommend or follow).

In addition, GrubHub may collect information regarding GrubHub account holders' current and past GrubHub orders, gratuity amounts, favorite restaurants, customer service inquiries, service/restaurant reviews and certain social networking preferences (e.g. pages you "Like" or "Recommend").

GrubHub also uses web analytics software to track and analyze traffic for its Services in connection with GrubHub's advertising and promotion of GrubHub services. GrubHub also aggregates certain information collected by the Applications including, but not limited to, certain order data, gratuity information, delivery locations, delivery driver mileage, and delivery driver location. GrubHub may publish these statistics or share them with third parties without including PII.

GrubHub may collect additional PII in connection with The Daily Grub blog submissions including professional title, business/personal website, social networking handle/username and the author's photograph.

  2. **GrubHub's Use Of Collected Information**

GrubHub uses PII to create users' GrubHub accounts, to communicate with users (directly and through restaurants and delivery drivers) about GrubHub services, to offer users additional services, promotions and special offers and to charge for purchases and gratuities made through GrubHub. Users may opt to allow GrubHub to store certain PII used to create users' GrubHub accounts, including, but not limited to, credit card information. GrubHub uses certain stored PII to customize future order processing for you. You may request that GrubHub cease storing certain PII at any time, but you might not be able to take advantage of certain customized features. Users may affirmatively opt-out of receiving promotional communications from GrubHub by visiting [http://www.GrubHub.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20130604224943id_/http://www.allmenus.com/your-privacy-rights/www.GrubHub.com) and providing GrubHub with their e-mail address via the opt-out link. GrubHub may also use PII to enforce GrubHub terms of use and service.

GrubHub uses PII submitted by authors of The Daily Grub blog content by publishing that information on The Daily Grub, and as otherwise agreed by GrubHub and submitting author. By submitting PII to GrubHub in connection with Daily Grub blog content, the author agrees to GrubHub's publication of that PII, and any other PII included within the blog content, on The Daily Grub.

GrubHub uses cookies to remember users on the Sites and to enhance users' experience on the Sites. For example, when users with GrubHub accounts return to the Sites, cookies identify those users and allow the Sites to provide certain user-specific information such as GrubHub account information, past orders, favorite restaurants and user restaurant reviews.

GrubHub does not sell the information it collects through the Services to third parties. GrubHub shares collected PII to third-party vendors and service providers with whom GrubHub works to provide application programming interfaces ("APIs") and other functions for the Services in connection with the delivery of GrubHub services. In addition, GrubHub shares users' GrubHub order content, special order instructions, first and last name, street address, e-mail address, telephone number and gratuity amounts with restaurants where users' orders are placed and delivery drivers, to the extent necessary to process and deliver those orders. GrubHub may also disclose PII to third parties such as attorneys, collection agencies, tribunals or law enforcement authorities pursuant to valid requests in connection with alleged violations of GrubHub terms of use and service or other alleged contract violations, infringement or similar harm to persons or property. DeliveryHub users must consent to the DeliveryHub Terms of Use (<http://www.grubhub.com/deliveryhub/termsofuse>).

User generated content posted through the Sites such as service/restaurant reviews and certain social networking preferences (e.g. pages you "Like" or "Recommend") may be viewed by the general public. Accordingly, GrubHub cannot ensure the privacy of any PII included in such user generated content.

  3. **GrubHub's Protection of PII**

GrubHub uses reasonable security measures equal to or exceeding industry standard to protect PII from unauthorized access, destruction, use, modification and disclosure. Unfortunately, even with these measures, GrubHub cannot guarantee the security of PII. By using the Services, you acknowledge and agree that GrubHub makes no such guarantee, and that you use the Services at your own risk.

  4. **Accessing and Correcting Your PII**

Registered GrubHub account holders can access and change their own PII using the "Edit" function on the GrubHub website. If you have questions regarding GrubHub's use or collection of your PII, please contact GrubHub's privacy officer at: accounts@grubhub.com.

  5. **Privacy Policy Amendments**

GrubHub may change this Privacy Policy at any time by posting a new version on this page or on a successor page. The new version will become effective on the posting date, which will be listed at the top of the page as the effective date.
