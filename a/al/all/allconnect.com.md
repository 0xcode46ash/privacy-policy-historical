**What Are The Important Terms Used Throughout This Privacy Policy?**

Throughout this privacy policy we use several specialized terms. "Personally Identifiable Information" is information that tells us specifically who you are, like your name, street address, birth date, email address, billing address, user ID number (including, if applicable, customer ID number and account number), social security number, credit card number, and other non-public information that is associated with the foregoing. "User Information" means all Personally Identifiable Information and any other forms of information discussed in this privacy policy, including the Internet Protocol (IP) address of a user's computer. We use the term "aggregate" when we combine information from various persons or users. Information is said to be "anonymized" if it does not identify individual persons or entities or associate a particular person or entity with such information.

**What Types Of Information Do We Collect, How Do We Use it and To Whom Do We Disclose It?**

Visiting Our Site. When you visit our website to browse, we may collect and store the domain name and host from which you access the Internet (e.g., google.com), the IP address of your computer, your browser software and operating system and your entity identification. We may use this information to organize and analyze IP addresses so that we can provide items such as efficient service, enhance security, monitor appropriate usage and produce traffic volume statistics. This type of non-Personally Identifiable information may be shared with third parties, such as when we aggregate and disclose site traffic information for marketing and commercial purposes. When you visit our website, you may also choose certain options such as (i) Your Account, (ii) About Allconnect, (iii) Bundles, Phone, TV, Internet, Utilities and Home Service, (iv) Customer Service and (v) Contact Us to obtain more information about us, our business associates and our Services. Through these options, you may provide us with Personally Identifiable Information. We will collect, use and disclose such Personally Identifiable Information as further described below in Using Our Services. 

Using Our Services.When you use our Services, you must through our initial registration process or subsequent order placements provide Personally Identifiable Information, including your name, address, e-mail address, and billing information for you to properly and fully receive the offered Services. We collect and store this Personally Identifiable Information and any modifications that either we or you make to that information, except that we do not permanently retain your social security number, credit card number or other payment information needed solely for the processing of your order. Except as set forth in this policy, we will not reveal any such Personally Identifiable Information to any third party without the consent of the provider of such information, except that we may share User Information with our business associates who assist us in administering the Services. In such cases, the business associates are permitted to use this information only in order to carry out the services Allconnect has contracted for. Furthermore, we may use, disclose or transfer certain User Information (i) to provide you the Services or information you request; (ii) to send you additional information about your ordered services such as a confirmation, reminder, problem status or change order; (iii) to send you a newsletter or other marketing materials; (iv) to protect the confidentiality or security of your records; (v) to comply with government requests if appropriate for your protection or in connection with an investigation or prosecution, court order, or subpoena or the like; (vi) in connection with a sale or merger of Allconnect or other change in corporate control (and you will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our Web site of any change in ownership or uses of your personal information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personal information), or (vii) for other legally permissible purposes. We may also share aggregate anonymized data relating to the transactions on the site and use of the Services for marketing, research and other purposes.

From time to time, we may send you survey forms or include survey forms on our site asking you for information regarding your use of our Services. For the most part, we will only disclose your survey responses that contain anonymized data to our business associates who assist us in administering the Services. However, we may share email addresses with business associates who assist us in administering the Services.

**What Information May Be Collected By Third Parties?**

When accessing our website or Services, you may have the option to obtain a coupon or purchase products and services from a third party through our website. For example, when you sign up to initiate service to your home by a utility or other service provider under Your Account, Allconnect passes the Personally Identifiable Information needed for that service on to the third party utility or service provider that provide services to help us with our business activities such as shipping your order or offering customer service. These companies are authorized to use your personal information only as necessary to provide these services to us. Please pay close attention when you obtain a coupon or are purchasing products and services from a third party because different rules may apply to those parties' use or disclosure of such information regardless of their affiliation or relationship with us.

Your interactions with these Features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.

Finally, our website may provide links to third party websites.

On a periodic basis, we also perform security audits of our data center to help ensure a more secure site. However, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed as 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your User Information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or receive from us.
