YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOU WILL BE BOUND BY ALL SUCH MODIFICATIONS, IF ANY, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER YOU PROVIDE SUCH EMAIL ADDRESS. 

1\. Information  
AB obtains information from and about you in number of different ways, including: 

  1. **General Information.** Some information ("General Information") is gathered automatically when you access the Site. This General Information (which includes Site pages visited, type of web browser used, type of operating system, and the domain name of your Internet service provider, and similar information) does not identify you personally. This may also include without limitation any and all information you provide at the location on the Site known as the "Exchange." 
  2. **Personal Information.** Some information that may be identifiable as yours (your "Personal Information") is not gathered automatically at the Site. If you wish to provide Personal Information, you must do so voluntarily, and may do so in a number of different ways. The following are some of the kinds of Personal Information AB gathers: 
    1. **Registration Information.** When you register at the Site, you will be asked for certain Personal Information, such as your name, your street mailing address, your email address, and other information;
    2. **Third Party Information.** When you register at a third party website, and provide Personal Information to such third parties, AB may (pursuant to agreements between AB and those third parties) obtain such information to populate AB Site registration forms for use when you hyperlink to the Site; 
    3. **Credit Card Information.** If you purchase goods or services at the Site, you will be asked for credit card information, including your name, account number and expiration date; and 
    4. **Email Information.** When you send us email messages, we may retain the content of your email messages, together with your email address and our response to you. 
  3. **Cookies.** Cookies are small pieces of data that are stored by a user's web browser on the hard drive of a user's computer. Cookies can "remember" what information ("Cookie Information") a user accesses on one web page to simplify subsequent interactions with that website by the same user, or can use that information to streamline the user's transactions on related websites. The Cookies AB uses do not capture your individual email address or any personally identifying information, but do permit AB to send focused advertising, online banner advertisements, new services, promotions or other such responses to you or assist your use of the Site. AB may also set Cookies when you register or when you acquire goods or services from the Site, and may do so without notice to or permission from you or any third party. Third party websites which are accessible from the Site via links, banner ads, or "click-throughs" may also use Cookies, and AB shall have no responsibility whatsoever for such Cookies. 



2\. General Use and Disclosure of Information  
AB uses and discloses your information as follows: 

  1. **General Information.** AB uses and discloses General Information to understand Site demographics and content preferences, and shall do so without notice to, or permission from, you or any third party. In particular, AB may provide aggregate information about our customers, sales, Site traffic patterns and related information to our affiliates or third parties; 
  2. **Personal Information.** As further provided in Section 3 ("Other Use and Disclosure of Personal Information"), AB uses and discloses to our business partners and affiliates Personal Information for purposes of administering AB business activities, providing customer service and making available other products and services to you and other AB customers and prospective customers from AB and those business partners and affiliates. This may include focused advertising, online banner advertisements, new services, promotions and other responses to you. AB may also use and disclose Personal Information to notify you about important changes to the Site or our business, new AB services and special offers you may find valuable; and 
  3. **Cookie Information.** AB uses and discloses Cookie Information to improve our Site and better serve you and our other customers, and may do so without notice to, or permission from, you or any third party.



3\. Other Use and Disclosure of Personal Information  
AB may enter into agreements with third parties who may be given access to Personal Information for the purpose of providing you information regarding products and services that we think will be of interest to you. We may also disclose any of your information when legally compelled to do so, or when we, in good faith, believe that the law requires it or for the protection of our legal rights. The following are some of the ways in which we may use or disclose your Personal Information to third parties: 

  1. **Registration Information.** AB may transfer the Personal Information you provide AB during the Site registration process to third parties for those parties to use to populate their own website registration forms when you hyperlink from the Site to their websites, in order to save you time in filling out their registration forms. Such third party websites may include websites that are owned by third parties or that are "co-branded" sites of AB; 
  2. **"Pre-Population" Information.** When you come to the Site from a third party website, or when you hyperlink from the Site to a third party website, and in either case provide Personal Information at that third party website, AB may obtain that Personal Information (pursuant to an agreement between AB and that third party), and use that Personal Information to populate Site registration forms in order to save you time filing out Site registration forms; and 
  3. **Shared Registration Information.** When you register at the Site, you may be given the opportunity to register simultaneously at the websites of certain third parties. Unless you opt out of this opportunity by checking or clicking on the icon indicated on the Site, you will be deemed to have consented to such simultaneous registration, and shall therefore be subject to the privacy policies, if any, of such third party website.

When you send credit card information to us at the Site, we use a technology called Secure Socket Layer (SSL) or Secure Electronic Transaction (SET) to encrypt this information between your computer and our server. Other personal information you send to us at the Site, however, including any email messages, will not be encrypted unless we advise you otherwise.

You may be able to access certain information related to third parties at the Site, or via links, banner ads, or "click-throughs" from the Site, regarding the goods or services of third parties (collectively, "Merchant Services"). You understand and agree that your access to or use of Merchant Services is a matter entirely between you and the associated third parties, and AB shall have no liability whatsoever for any such access or use. 

6\. Community
