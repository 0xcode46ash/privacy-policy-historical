**Introduction  
** Alfred Angelo, Inc. ("Alfred Angelo") owns and operates [**_www.alfredangelo.com_**](https://web.archive.org/ "Visit AlfredAngeloBridal.com") and related websites and webpages ("service"). In order to preserve and protect the confidence and trust our customers have in Alfred Angelo, we have adopted the following policies governing use of our service and any personal information supplied online ("policies"). These policies may be changed from time to time and you should visit this page to familiarize yourself with our current policies.

 **Personal Information  
** Alfred Angelo generally collects personal information only with your knowledge and consent. Personal information may include your name, address, email address, and phone number, and we may request and you may choose to supply other information such as age, gender, credit card or other personal information (collectively "personal information.") Alfred Angelo may collect information about your transactions with us and with some of our business partners, including information about your use of our products and services that we offer.  Alfred Angelo may also record information on our server logs from your browser, including your IP address, cookie information, and the page or pages you request.

 **Use of Information Provided by You  
** Alfred Angelo uses personal information provided by you to provide the goods or services you have requested. We may also use personal information to communicate with you about new offers, features, products or services or to improve the services that we offer. Alfred Angelo does not sell your personal information, including your email address to any third party, although we may choose to rent, trade or otherwise disclose personal information to selected third parties as set forth in these policies.  In order to facilitate communications between you and affiliated full service bridal salons that carry Alfred Angelo® apparel and accessories, Alfred Angelo sends personal information to such salons who may contact you directly. Personal information may include your name, email address, suggested dress or style information and other personal information you supply to us.  We may also share personal information with others including our affiliates and carefully selected companies who we believe can offer you products or services that may be of interest to you.  If you wish not to have your personal information disclosed or you wish not to be contacted by bridal salons or others, please email or write to us as provided below.

To provide you with better service, we may also use "cookies" which are small bits of code, usually stored on a user's computer hard drive, which enable a website to "personalize" itself for each user or to facilitate future use of our service.  If we or any of our lines of business are sold or disposed of as a going concern, whether by merger, sale of assets or otherwise, the relevant customer database may be sold as part of that transaction and your personal information accessed by such successor or purchaser.

 **Children Under Age 13  
** We do not collect or disseminate personal information about anyone whom we have actual knowledge is under the age of 13.

 **Security  
** To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure correct use of information, we employ reasonable and current Internet security methods and technologies. We use Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology to encrypt credit card numbers to prevent your information from being read during transmission over the Internet.
