 **Access to Information**

  2. The College shall refuse to disclose personal information to any person other than the individual to whom the information relates except:  
2.1upon the prior written request or consent of the individual;  
2.2. in compelling circumstances affecting the health or safety of an individual; or

    3. the address and telephone number of an employee who can answer questions about the collection.

  5. FIPPA permits the disclosure of personal information to an institution or a law enforcement agency in Canada to help an investigation undertaken with a view to a law enforcement proceeding or from which a law enforcement proceeding is likely to result (section 42 (g) of the _Act_ ).

  9. FIPPA shall not preclude the College from giving access to information in response to an oral request or in the absence of a request. Any existing practice for the release of information, which is not personal in nature, may continue at the discretion of the responsible Vice President.
  10. The College will apply the Detailed Procedures found in the Procedures Manual produced by the Office of the Information and Privacy Commission of Ontario. In addition, staff are encouraged to read the legislation and to contact the FOI Coordinator if they require information.
