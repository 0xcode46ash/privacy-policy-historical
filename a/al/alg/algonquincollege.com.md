# Compliance with Ontario's Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act

**PREAMBLE**

Ontario’s Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act, which came into force on January 1, 1988, gives individuals a legal right of access to information held by the Government and its Agencies.  The Act also gives individuals a right of access to their own personal information and establishes standards to ensure that this information is protected.

 **POLICY**

In keeping with the objectives of the Act, the College will:

(a)   Provide right of access to information under its control in accordance with the principles that,

  * information held by institutions should be available to the public;
  * necessary exemptions from this general right of access should be limited and specific and in accordance with the Act;
  * decisions on the disclosure of government information should be reviewed independently.



(b)   Protect the privacy of individuals with respect to personal information about themselves held by the College, and to provide individuals with a right of access to that information. The College will not disclose the personal information of any member of the College community to any third party unless it is otherwise provided for under the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act (see Appendix A for those circumstances when personal information can be disclosed).

As the Head of this institution, the Chair, Board of Governors, is responsible for ensuring compliance with this Act.  The powers or duties of the Chair may be delegated in writing to an officer or officers of the College.

The College shall appoint a Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy (FOI) Coordinator who will be responsible for coordination of activities related to this legislation.

The application of this Act shall not preclude the College from giving access to information in response to an oral request or in the absence of a request.  Any existing practice for the release of information, which is not personal in nature, may continue at the discretion of the responsible Vice President.

 **POLICIES, PROCEDURES AND RESPONSIBILITIES**

Receipt and Logging of Request 

All requests for access under the Act will be received by, or directed to the FOI Coordinator, Robert Letourneau, 1385 Woodroffe Avenue, Room C548, Ottawa, Ontario, K2G 1V8.  This will include requests referred to the College from the Ministry of Training, Colleges and Universities or other Government organizations.  Requests under the Act must:

  * be in writing and accompanied by a $5.00 fee, and
  * provide sufficient details about the information sought.



While the Act prescribes forms for submitting a request, and the use of these forms will be encouraged, any request submitted in writing which seeks access under the Act, will be sufficient.

If the request is not sufficiently descriptive, the Coordinator will notify the requester within the stipulated 30-day deadline and provide help in pinpointing the record to which access has been demanded.  At this point, the time limit will be suspended until the Coordinator receives written notice either to continue with the search or to discontinue.

All requests will be logged from the date of their receipt by the College.

Search for the Record

When a request is deemed to be sufficiently descriptive to locate the record to which access has been requested, the FOI Coordinator will forward the request to the Records Coordinator for the Area* concerned, along with time remaining to comply with the request.  Each Area will name an individual who will coordinate the search and release of records for the FOI Coordinator.

When the Area receives a request, it will conduct a search for the requested record; determine whether the information requested can be retrieved in whole or in part; estimate the time and cost needed to search for, retrieve and prepare the information for release; and forward the information with a recommendation for/against disclosure to the President or appropriate Vice President/Executive Director for his/her approval.

*The seven Areas of the College are:

  * President
  * Academic
  * Administration
  * Business Development
  * Human Resources
  * Student Services
  * Advancement



Approval for Release

The President, Vice President or Executive Director will review the request, the information retrieved and the recommendation for the release of the information.  The FOI Coordinator will be provided with a written approval for the release of information along with the information retrieved.

Release of Information

The FOI Coordinator will notify the requester in writing advising him/her of the fee estimate (if any) for the search, preparation and photocopying of the records.  If the fee estimate is over $100.00, a deposit equal to 50% of the fee estimate will be required before processing of the request is resumed.  Upon completion of the request, the requestor will be informed of any additional amount outstanding.  The request will not be actioned until payment has been received in full.  If access is to be provided, the information will be released.  In case of denial of the request, the FOI Coordinator will send a letter informing the requester of the reasons for refusal and his/her right of appeal to the Commissioner for review of this decision.  The notification to the requester for release (or denial) along with any records to be released will be sent within 30 calendar days after a ‘complete request’ has been received by the College.

 **INTERPRETATION OF THE ACT**

The FOI Coordinator will be the contact person for all public inquiries regarding the Act.  The Coordinator will review all requests for access and rule on refusals, exemptions, transfers severance and third party notification.  He/she will rely on his/her knowledge of the Act and seek legal counsel if necessary to ensure that the College is in compliance with the legislation.

The Coordinator will represent the College at any enquiries or appeals conducted by the Commissioner.

 **COLLECTION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION**

The College will ensure that all forms by which personal information is collected will specify:

  * the legal authority for the collection;
  * the principal purpose(s) for which the information is to be used; and
  * the address and telephone number of an employee who can answer questions about the collection.



 **TRACKING AND RECORDING**

The FOI Coordinator will document information on all requests received, the rationale for decisions on access and the disposition of the requests.  A tracking and recording system will be used to ensure that all requests are processed within the established time limits and to generate the statistics for the annual report to the Commissioner.

 **COMPLIANCE**

The FOI Coordinator will require the assistance of the President, Vice President or Executive Director to monitor compliance with the privacy provisions of the Act and the notification requirements on forms.

 **DETAILED PROCEDURES**

Detailed procedures, as described in the Procedures Manual produced by the Office of the Information and Privacy Commission of Ontario will apply.  In addition, staff are encouraged to read the legislation and to contact the Coordinator if they require information: <http://www.ipc.on.ca/english/Resources/IPC-Corporate/IPC-Corporate-Summary/?id=665>
