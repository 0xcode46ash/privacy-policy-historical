# Privacy Policy | AlienVault

This privacy policy describes AlienVault's practices regarding how information we collect from you is used and shared with third parties. By visiting the AlienVault web sites, using our products and services, you accept the practices described in this privacy policy. This privacy policy applies to anonymous data and personal information collected at our web sites, and to personal information collected in connection with the sale, support and use of our products and services. This privacy policy also applies where you are a customer or user of any of our hosted service offerings.

## Part I. Information Collection

We may collect personal information through our web sites. We gather various types of personal information from our users, as explained in more detail below, and we use this personal information internally in connection with our products and services, including to personalize, provide, and improve our products and services, to allow you to set up a user account and profile, to contact you and allow other users to contact you, to fulfill your requests for certain products and services, and to analyze how you use the products and services.

AlienVault web sites collect personal information at several points, including but not limited to processes associated with e-commerce, product registration, account creation and e-mail opt-in. Visitors may voluntarily provide (and we will collect) information including but not limited to: name, email address, billing and shipping information, product purchase information, and product registration information.

We may collect information related to the use of our web sites - through, for example, the use of cookies - in order to better understand our customers' needs. A cookie is a small text file that our web server places on your computer hard drive that includes a unique identifier. Cookies enable us to track usage patterns and deliver customized content to users. We may also use web bugs, clear gifs and similar technologies that collect data similar to that collected by a cookie.

If you do not wish AlienVault to use your personal information as described in this section, please follow the procedure in Part III (Access to Your Information) below.

In order to protect the privacy interests of younger Internet users, we do not actively market our web sites or products to children under 13. We do not knowingly collect information from children under 13 for marketing purposes. We encourage children of any age to visit our web sites or to use our products and services only with the supervision of their parents.

## Part II. Information Usage

The information collected by us is used to understand how customers are using our products and services in order to make them better. We may use this data to revise the products and services based on your usage patterns, either individually or as part of the aggregated useage patterns of our other users. We may also use it to improve the products and services – for example, this data can tell us how often users use a particular feature of the products and services, and we can use that knowledge to improve the products and services for as many users as possible. Note: for USM v5.x users who have opted in to telemetry collection, you can [view a sample file](https://www.alienvault.com/legal/sample-telemetry-file) of the anonymous data collected and learn more about [telemetry collection](https://www.alienvault.com/knowledge-base/what-is-telemetry-collection-and-how-does-it-work) in AlienVault.

Anonymous, aggregated data is analyzed on a regular basis to understand product use and quality, feature popularity, quality, and to assist in the design of future products and services.

Personal information is used to fulfill orders, provide customer support, and for marketing purposes such as email announcements of new products or offers. We provide an option for you to choose not to receive marketing communications and you may always contact us at [privacy@alienvault.com](mailto:privacy@alienvault.com?subject=I%20would%20like%20to%20opt-out%20of%20marketing%20communications%20) to opt-out of marketing communications (however, we reserve the right to use your contact information if we consider it necessary to send you crucial information about the product or services you have purchased from us.)

We may also share information with companies integral to the use of the product or service. In those cases, the use of that information is subject to the privacy policies of the receiving party.

We may use third parties (including contractors and service providers) to help with certain aspects of our operations, which may require disclosure of your personal information to them. For example, we may use a third party to communicate with you (via telephone, email, or letter) about our products or services, to send information to you, to process and collect payment via your credit card (if applicable), and to perform other work that we may need to outsource. We require these contractors and third parties to use your personal information only as necessary to perform the services they are asked to perform.

We may share some or all of your personal information with our current or future "affiliates" (which means a parent company, any subsidiaries, joint ventures, or other companies under a common control), in which case we will require our affiliates to honor this privacy policy. If another company acquires AlienVault (or a business unit of AlienVault that uses your personal information), that company will possess the personal information collected by us and it will assume the rights and obligations regarding your personal information as described in this privacy policy.

We offer links to other web sites. Please note: those other web sites may observe privacy standards different from ours and the collection and use of your personal information will be governed by the privacy policies on those other sites.

Our web sites may offer a space for postings and submissions. Please be advised that any information posted in these venues will be publicly available.

## Part III. Access to Your Information

If you wish to correct or delete of any of your personal information held by us or a change in the way we use your information, please contact support at [privacy@alienvault.com](mailto:privacy@alienvault.com?subject=Question%20about%20information%20collected). We will use commercially reasonable efforts to fulfill your request in a timely manner, but not more than 30 days. However, even if we delete such personal information from our 'live' database, it may still be stored on other databases (including those kept for archival purposes).

## Part IV. Data Storage and Security

We use industry-standard methods of securing electronic databases of personal information. Except as provided elsewhere in this privacy policy, we limit access to personal information in electronic databases to those persons in our organization who have a business need for such access. However, you should know that no web site operator, including AlienVault, can fully eliminate security risks associated with personal information.

Your privacy is very important to us. Due to factors beyond our control, however, we cannot fully ensure that your personal information will not be disclosed to third parties other than those mentioned above. For example, we may be legally required to disclose information to the government or third parties under certain circumstances, or third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications.

AlienVault’s hosted service offerings may store electronic data, text, queries and other information provided by its customers, some of which may be personal information. We do not own or control any of the information we process on behalf of our customers. We receive information transferred from our customers merely as a data processor, and typically do not collect, access, transfer or use any of this information ourselves. At the direction of our customers, we may perform query operations or transfer data to third parties for hosting purposes or integration with third party software products or services. Any access to or use of personal information by us is incidental to performing our contractual obligations to our customers as a data processor. We rely on our customers to ensure that personal information is relevant for the purposes for which it is used, reliable for its intended use, accurate, complete and current, and is collected, accessed, transferred and used in a manner that does not infringe the rights or privacy of any individual and does not violate any applicable law, regulation or directive.

## Part V. Modifications

We may amend this privacy policy at any time by posting the amended version on our web sites.

## Part VI. Contact Information

If you have any questions regarding this privacy policy, please [contact support](https://www.alienvault.com/contact). We will use commercially reasonable efforts to resolve disputes within 90 days.
