We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers’ personal information. 

We may use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by recipients.  This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns.

** Our web site includes social media features, such as the Facebook like button. These features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our site, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly.
