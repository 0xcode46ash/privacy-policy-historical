Privacy Statement

alight.com respects your privacy! However, we do collect customer information in an effort to improve your shopping experience. We recognize we must maintain and use customer information responsibly.

We may use customer information for marketing and promotional purposes. We do not currently sell online customer information to any outside company or third party. In the future, if you do not want your information distributed to outside parties, please send an e–mail message to [support@alight.com](mailto:support@alight.com) and type "no third parties" in the subject line.

**Your information is secure with alight.com!**  
Protecting your order information is a priority. alight.com makes every effort to protect your online order information using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology.

SSL encrypts your order information to avoid the decoding of that information by anyone other than alight.com. To check the security of your connection, look at the lower left–hand corner of your browser window after accessing the server. If you see an unbroken key or a closed lock (depending on your browser), then SSL is active. You can also double check by looking at the URL line of your browser. When accessing a secure server, the first characters of the site address will change from "http" to "https".

Some versions of firewalls don't permit communication through secure servers. In that case, you will be unable to connect to the server (and you won't have to worry about placing an order through an unsecured connection).

If you cannot access a secure server for any reason, please feel free to use our offline order form available upon checkout, or place your order by phone. Call us toll free at 877–367–7001, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Our Customer Service representatives will be happy to assist you.
