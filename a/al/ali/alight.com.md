We take this matter very seriously, and have instituted many policies and procedures to insure that none of your privacy rights are ever violated. alight.com is a part of the Yahoo! network of stores. Yahoo! hosts our store pages, ordering system, and order data.   
While Yahoo! automatically collects order information, it does not make it available to any other party. If you accessed us through Yahoo!

**What personally identifiable information is collected and how is it used?**   
  
When you make a purchase, you are required to provide your shipping and billing address, phone number and credit card information. This information is stored in a secured database, only accessible to employees with access rights to this information. alight.com makes every effort to protect your online order information using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology. 

Additionally, alight.com logs your Internet Protocol Address (IP). An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer every time you browse the Internet. Information from IP addresses is used for system administration, to examine overall traffic trends, troubleshooting, etc. This information is kept private. IP addresses are not linked to any personally identifiable information, meaning that although the user session is tracked, the user is anonymous.

We do not currently share or have any plans to share user information with third parties. We may, in the future, share user information with selected partners if we feel they offer a valuable service or product for our users. 

In the event that alight.com is merged with or acquired by a third party, we retain the right to transfer all personal (consumer) information databases to successors in business or purchasers of the site and its assets.

Your information is secure with alight.com! ****

We have partnered with Yahoo! to handle our online transactions. We use secure servers to protect your personal information, including your name, address, and credit card information. We use the Stronghold secure server, currently the second best-selling secure server software, and in our opinion, the best product technically. It supports industry-standard 128-bit SSL encryption.  


When you enter your credit card number into the order form, it is transmitted across the Internet in an encrypted (scrambled) form, then decoded when it reaches us. 

  
If you are not the kind of person who worries about being hit by lightning as you're crossing the street, you probably don't have to worry that your credit card number will be intercepted on the way to a secure Web site. According to CNN, "The prevalent opinion... is that on-line credit card use is actually no riskier for consumers than traditional "low-tech" transactions." 

So order with confidence at alight.com.
