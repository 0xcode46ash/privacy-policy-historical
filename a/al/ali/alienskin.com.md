# About Us [privacy policy]

**Alien Skin Software Privacy Policy**

Alien Skin Software will never sell, trade, rent or loan the personal information you provide us to any other company without your permission, unless the cops hand us a warrant or something. We respect your right to privacy. 

**How we collect what we collect**  
We collect information when you order from us, when you download demo and/or public beta software, and when you register with us. We keep two separate lists: an email list, and a postal mail list. We will never make the email list available to any other company; it is used only by Alien Skin for new product and upgrade announcements, special offers, tech support issues and the like. We do occasionally make postal mail addresses available to select partners, but only if you have given us permission. 

**When you order from us**  
We collect information necessary to complete your order, including your name, company name (if applicable), email address, shipping address and phone number. 

If you buy our software over the phone and pay by credit card, we collect your card number and expiration date. This information is kept with your personal information in our database of registered users, and will never be shared with any other company. If you buy our software via our online store, we store only the last four digits of your card number. 

When you order from our online store, you are given the choice of receiving further information from them about product updates, upgrades and special offers. If you check the relevant box, we will also place you on the Alien Skin email list. If you don't check the box, you will not be placed on Alien Skin's mailing lists (although you will still be registered with us). 

We will never make any contact information obtained from Web orders available to anyone else. 

**When you download demo and/or public beta software**  
If you download a demo or a public beta version of one of our products, we will request your email address. We will send you a reminder that you are using a demo or a public beta version and add you to our email announcement list. To have your name removed from our mailing list, simply reply to the email with the word "Remove" in the subject line. 

**When you register with us**  
If you buy one of our products elsewhere and register with us, either online or by sending in your registration card, we will keep your registration code along with your contact information: name, address, phone, email and platform. 

At the point of registration, you are free to decline to be our email list when you register with us, either online or via your mail-in registration card. We use this list to announce new product information, upgrades, patches and special deals to our users, and will not share it with anyone else without customer permission. 

At the point of registration, we do ask if you will allow us to make your postal mail information available to a select few other companies with whom we work closely. If you decline, we will never trade or sell your postal information. 

Under no circumstances will we make your email address available to anyone else. Replying to any email we send with the word "Remove" will remove your name from our mailing list. 

**Updating your information with us**  
You can easily update or delete your contact information, or ask to be added or removed from our mailing list, at any time. Simply phone, fax, email or mail us with your request:
