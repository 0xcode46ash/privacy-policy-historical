# Privacy Policy | A Cork, Fork, & Passport™

## This site uses cookies.

If you continue to use our site, you are providing implied consent. If you’re unsure about how cookies are used, please read on. If you understand how cookies are used and you would prefer to not have your activity tracked, you should exit our site now.

Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used. Julie Cohn is the sole owner of the information collected on A Cork, Fork, & Passport.

## Privacy

A Cork, Fork, & Passport may collect personally identifiable information from our users at multiple points on our website.  This notice applies to all information collected or submitted on websites owned by Julie Cohn. On some pages, you can make requests and register to receive materials. I may share aggregated demographic information about our user base. I do not link aggregate user data with personally identifiable information. I do not share personally identifiable information with third parties.

I reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our website.

As is true of most websites, A Cork, Fork, & Passport gathers certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and click-stream data.

I use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users’ movements around the site and to gather demographic information about the user base as a whole. If your personally identifiable information changes, or if you no longer desire our service, you may update us by sending an email to jules@alittlebiteoflife.net.

The security of your personal information is important to me. I follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once I receive it.

No method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while I strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, I cannot guarantee its absolute security.

I do not link this automatically collected data to personally identifiable information. This web site contains links to other sites that are not owned or controlled by Julie Cohn. Please be aware that Julie Cohn is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. I encourage you to be aware when you leave this site and to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies only to information collected by this web site.

I use the information you provide about yourself to communicate with you in response to your inquiries and to provide the services you request. I use non-identifying and aggregate information to better design this website. Finally, I never use or share the personally identifiable information provided to me online in ways unrelated to the ones described above without also providing you an opportunity to opt-out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses.

In order to provide certain services to you, I may on occasion supplement the personal information you submitted with information from third-party sources. In the event A Cork, Fork, & Passport goes through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, your personally identifiable information will likely be among the assets transferred. You will be notified via prominent notice on this web site for 30 days of any such change in ownership or control of your personal information.

If I decide to change our privacy policy, I will post those changes to this privacy statement and other places we deem appropriate so that you are aware of what information I collect, how I use it, and under what circumstances, if any, I disclose it. I reserve the right to modify this privacy statement at any time, so please review it frequently. If I make material changes to this policy, I will notify you here, by email, or by means of a notice on the home page.

  * Improve the speed/security of the site
  * Allow you to share pages with social networks like Facebook

  * Collect any personally identifiable information (without your express permission)
  * Collect any sensitive information (without your express permission)
  * Pass data to advertising networks

You can learn more about all the cookies used below.

### Granting  permission to use cookies

If the settings on the software you are using to view this website (your browser) are adjusted to accept cookies I take this, and your continued use of our website, to mean that you are fine with this. Should you wish to remove or not use cookies from our site you can learn how to do this below, however doing so will likely mean that our site will not work as you would expect.

### More about cookies

#### Website-function cookies

##### Our own cookies

We use cookies to make our website work including:

  * Remembering your search settings



There is no way to prevent these cookies being set other than to not use our site.

#### Third-party functions

Our site, like most websites, includes functionality provided by third parties. A common example is an embedded YouTube video. Our site includes the following, which use cookies:

  * YouTube



Disabling these cookies will likely break the functions offered by these third parties.

#### Social websites cookies

So you can easily _Like_ or share our content on sites such as Facebook and Twitter and we have included sharing buttons on our site.

Cookies are set by:

  * Facebook
  * Twitter
  * LinkedIn
  * Pinterest
  * Google+
  * AddThis



The privacy implications on this will vary from social network to social network and will be dependent on the privacy settings you have chosen on these networks.

#### Visitor-statistics cookies

I use cookies to compile visitor statistics such as how many people have visited our website, what type of technology they are using (e.g., Mac or Windows, which helps to identify when our site isn’t working as it should for particular technologies), how long they spend on the site, what page they look at, and so on. This helps me to continuously improve the website. These so called _analytics_ programs also tell me how people reached this site (e.g., from a search engine or another website) and whether they have been here before, helping me to put more effort into developing content for you.

I use:

  * Google Analytics



### Turning cookies off

You can usually switch cookies off by adjusting your browser settings to stop it from accepting cookies (learn how [here](http://www.attacat.co.uk/resources/cookies/how-to-ban "How to ban cookies")). Doing so however will likely limit the functionality of this site and a large proportion of the world’s websites — cookies are a standard part of most modern websites.

It may be that you have concerns around cookies relating to so called _spyware_. Rather than switching off cookies in your browser you may find anti-spyware software achieves the same objective by automatically deleting cookies considered to be invasive. Learn more about [managing cookies with anti-spyware software](http://www.attacat.co.uk/resources/cookies/how-to-control-your-online-privacy "Control your online privacy").

The cookie information text on this site was derived from content provided by [Attacat Internet Marketing](http://www.attacat.co.uk/ "Attacat"), a marketing agency based in Edinburgh. If you need similar information for your own website you can use their [free cookie audit tool](http://www.attacat.co.uk/resources/cookies "Free cookie audit tool"). This information was shared with me by permission by Cyndie Shafstall of SpiderTrainers.com during a Wordcamp Denver class where she talked about the [importance of a sites privacy policy](http://spidertrainers.com/privacy-less/).
