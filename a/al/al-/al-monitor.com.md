# Al-Monitor Privacy Statement

Effective Date:  **May 22, 2012**

Welcome to Al-Monitor.com, a service of Al-Monitor, LLC.  Al-Monitor respects the privacy of visitors to our website.  Please read this Privacy Statement carefully so that you understand what information we collect through our website and what we do with that information.  This Privacy Statement applies only to information collected online through the Al-Monitor website and does not apply to any information you may provide to us, or that we may collect, offline or through other means (for example, via telephone, through the mail, or at live events).  If you have any questions about this Privacy Statement, we can be reached via email at [privacy@al-monitor.com](mailto:privacy@al-monitor.com?subject=Al-Monitor%20Privacy%20Statement%20Question&body=test).

PROTECTING THE PRIVACY OF CHILDREN

Children should always get permission from their parents before sending any information about themselves (such as their names, email addresses, and phone numbers) over the Internet, to us or to anyone else.  Our website is not directed at children under the age of 13 and we won’t knowingly allow anyone under the age of 13 to provide us any personal information.  If you’re under 13, please don’t provide any information about yourself on this website. 

TYPES OF INFORMATION WE COLLECT

The information we gather falls into two categories: (1) information voluntarily supplied by visitors to the site when they register, sign up to receive our email newsletters, post comments in any of the public posting areas on our site, respond to user surveys, and the like; and (2) anonymous tracking information that is automatically gathered as visitors navigate through our website and review our email newsletters and other email messages.  This information may be collected directly by us or it may be collected by third-party service providers on our behalf.  Third parties featured on or linked to by our website, such as advertisers and others that display promotional messages on our site or offer products and services through our site (“Advertisers”), may be gathering information as well, through processes we don’t control.

_Information You Voluntarily Supply to Us_

We may collect and store information that you voluntarily supply to us while on our site.  This may include personally identifying information if you choose to provide it.  In accessing and using the Al-Monitor website, you may have the opportunity to voluntarily submit some or all of the following types of information:

  * Contact information, such as your name and email address;
  * Demographic information, such as gender, country (and, where applicable, your postal code);
  * Login information, such as a username and password;
  * Communications preferences, such as which email messages you would like to receive from us;
  * Payment information (such as a credit card number) necessary to process a requested transaction;
  * Information posted in public posting areas and other interactive areas of our site; and
  * Questions or correspondence you send to us through the “Send Us Your Thoughts” function available on our site. 



You are not required to provide information about yourself to visit our site.  However, if you wish to receive any of our newsletters, you will be required to provide us the email address to which you want us to send the newsletters.  We’ll also ask you for your gender, the country in which you reside, and, where applicable, your postal code.  If you wish to post comments in any of the public posting areas on our site, you will be required to register.  When you register, we’ll ask you for your email address, gender and country and, where applicable, your postal code.  You’ll also have to provide a username and a password.

_Information That Is Collected Automatically_

We also may collect and store, and permit our service providers to collect and store, information that does not identify you personally that is generated automatically as you navigate through the site.  For example, we and our service providers may collect limited information about the  configuration of your computer or other device through which you visit our site, including the type of browser software you use, the operating system you’re running, the resolution of your computer monitor, the website that referred you, the type of mobile device you’re using to access our website (for example, iPhone, BlackBerry, Android device, tablet, etc.), and your IP address.  (Your IP address is a numerical address that is used by computers connected to the Internet to identify your computer so that data – such as the web pages you want to view – can be transmitted to you.  We also use IP address information for systems administration and trouble shooting purposes.)  We use this information to make our site as useful as we can for as many users as possible.

_Cookies and Pixel Tags_

We may use “cookies,” a standard feature found in browser software, to enhance your experience on the site.  Cookies are small files that your web browser places on your hard drive for record-keeping purposes.  We also may use pixel tags (sometimes referred to as “clear GIFs” or “web beacons”) to collect non-personally identifying information about how our visitors use our site.  By showing how and when visitors and registered users use the site, cookies and pixel tags help us deliver more relevant content to users, identify how many unique users visit our site and various pages within our site, and anonymously track user interests, trends and patterns.  For example, we may use these technologies to collect aggregate information about the time visitors spend on each page of our site, the number of visits made to each page or section of our site, and the content that visitors select and copy using the standard copy and paste tool provided in standard web browsers.  Providers of web analytics services may use cookies and pixel tags to gather this sort of information on our behalf.  And Advertisers that display ads or other promotional messages (“Ads”) on our site (and their providers of ad serving and other advertising services) may use cookies and pixel tags of their own in connection with Ads displayed on our site, as described below under the heading “Data Collected in Connection with Ads.”  

We also may use cookies to record certain preferences that you enter or set while using the site.  For example, if you are a registered user and you opt to have the site “remember you,” we’ll use cookies to automatically store your log-in information so that you won’t have to re-enter it the next time you visit.

The help function on most web browsers contains information on how to set your browser to notify you before accepting a cookie or to disable cookies entirely.  However, if you don’t accept cookies, you won’t be able to take advantage of various features on our site that are available to other visitors.  For example, we won’t be able to store your log-in information, so that you don’t have to log in each time you visit, unless you accept cookies.

HOW WE USE COLLECTED INFORMATION

_Generally_

We use the information we collect from you while you are using the site in a variety of ways, including, for example, to process your registration, to provide you with services and communications that you have requested, to send you email updates, newsletters, and other communications, to deliver our site content to you, to measure site traffic, to measure user interests and traffic patterns, and to improve the site and the services and features offered via the site.

_Your Email Address_

In addition, we may use your email address to contact you for customer service purposes, to inform you of important changes or additions to our site or the services offered over our site, to send you administrative notices and other information about our site, and to tell you about other products or services offered by Al-Monitor, or other companies, that we think may be of interest to you.  If you subscribe to any of our newsletters, we’ll use your email address to send the newsletters to you.  Although we hope you’ll find these communications informative and useful, if you don’t, you can always unsubscribe to either type of message by following the simple instructions included in each email.

_Information You Provide When Making a Purchase_

When you purchase any product or service on our site, we collect the information necessary to process the requested transaction, such as your name, email address, mailing address, billing address, and credit card information.  Al-Monitor does not store your credit card information; it is sent directly to our third-party credit card processor and is secured during transmission over the Internet using industry-standard secure sockets layer (SSL) encryption.  Our credit card processor is authorized to use your credit card information only to process your requested transaction, and for no other purpose.

_Data Collected in Connection with Ads_

Advertisers that display Ads on our site (and their providers of ad serving and other advertising services) may use cookies and pixel tags of their own to record your web browser’s interaction with a given Ad.  This technique allows the Advertiser (and its providers of ad serving and other advertising services) to track which Ads are displayed, and which are clicked on, and to limit the number of times a given Ad is shown to you.  The use of cookies and pixel tags may also enable these Advertisers (and their providers of ad serving and other advertising services) to serve ads to our users based on their perceived interests as gleaned from their visits to this and other websites.  For example, DoubleClick, a provider of ad serving and other advertising services, may set cookies in connection with Ads displayed on our website through our relationship with Google.  For a detailed description of Google’s interest-based advertising program, or to opt out of receiving interest-based ads from Google, [click here](http://www.google.com/privacy/ads/).

_Disclosure to Third Parties_

To help Advertisers (and their ad agencies) understand our audience and confirm the value of advertising on Al-Monitor, we may present them with aggregate information on our audience and how our audience uses our site (for example, information on traffic to various pages within our site).  This information does not identify you personally. 

We may share the information that is collected through this site with our third-party service providers for purposes related to site administration and operation.  In some cases, we may permit our third-party service providers to collect such information directly, on our behalf.  For example, this website may use third-party web analytics services to help analyze how users use the site.  These services may use cookies and pixel tags to collect non-personally identifying tracking data directly from our site on our behalf, and then use that data to provide us with statistical reports on website activity.  If you use a credit or debit card to complete a transaction on our site, your personal information and credit card number will be sent directly to our credit card processing service provider to complete your transaction.  We also may share your email address and name with third-party email services providers that send newsletters and other communications on our behalf.

We also may occasionally release information about our visitors and registered users if required to do so by law or if, in our judgment, such disclosure is reasonably necessary to comply with legal process, to enforce our [Visitor Agreement](http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/visitoragreement), or to protect the rights, property, or personal safety of visitors to our site, our employees, our donors, sponsors or Advertisers, or others.  In the unlikely event that we sell some or all of our assets, or our site is acquired by another company, information about visitors to our site may be among the transferred assets. 

_Interacting With Our Site_

You may post comments on our site through the Facebook Comment plugin you’ll find on pages throughout our site. If you don’t uncheck the box adjacent to the Comment plugin, your comment may also be posted to Facebook.  You may interact with content on our site through social media plugins provided by Facebook, Twitter, and Google.  We do not control the information that these companies collect when you use these tools, nor do we control how they use any information they collect.  We encourage you review their privacy policies before interacting with our site through these tools.  Facebook’s privacy policy can be found [here](http://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/); Twitter’s privacy policy can be found [here](https://twitter.com/privacy); Google’s privacy policy can be found [here](http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/).

Please keep in mind that whenever you make your personal information or other information available for viewing by other users online – whether in comments posted to our site, or in other public posting areas of our site – that information can be seen, collected and used by anyone with access to the Internet; we are not able to control how they may use this information.  We cannot be responsible for any use of such information by third parties.

_Storage of Information_

The information that we collect through the Al-Monitor website is stored within databases that we control (or databases hosted on our behalf) on servers maintained in protected environments within the United States.  Any credit card information you provide on our site is secured for transmission over the Internet using industry-standard secure sockets layer (SSL) encryption.  However, no physical or electronic security system is impenetrable.  We cannot guarantee the security of our servers or databases, nor can we guarantee that information you supply will not be intercepted while being transmitted to us or our third-party service providers over the Internet.

CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY STATEMENT

The web is an evolving medium.  If we need to change this Privacy Statement in the future, we will post the revised Privacy Statement on our site and update the “Effective Date,” above, to reflect the date of the changes.  By continuing to use this website after we post such changes, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Statement, as modified.
