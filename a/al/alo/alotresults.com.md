###  How We Gather Information

Like most Web sites, we do collect information automatically and through the use of electronic tools that may be transparent to our visitors. We track information about how you use our site through the use of cookies, Internet tags or web beacons, and site visit data collection (log files, server logs, clickstream). For example, your Internet browser automatically transmits to us information such as the URL of the website you just came from and the Internet Protocol (IP) address and the browser version your computer is currently using.

As one example, we may combine information about your usage patterns with similar information obtained from other users to learn which pages are visited the most or what features are the most attractive.

As we continue to develop our business, we may sell, buy, merge or partner with other companies or businesses. In such transactions, user information may be among the transferred assets. We may also disclose your information in response to a court order, at other times when we believe we are reasonably required to do so by law, in connection with the collection of amounts you may owe to us, and/or whenever we deem it appropriate or necessary to give such information to law enforcement authorities.
