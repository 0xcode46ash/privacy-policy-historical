# About This Site | Alzheimer's Association

## Introduction

The Alzheimer's Association website provides information on the symptoms and signs, seven stages, diagnosis, treatment and care of Alzheimer's disease and dementia.  Get support from our 24/7 Helpline, message boards and your local Alzheimer's Association Chapter. We also provide updates on Alzheimer's Association programs, partners and events. 

Our audience includes caregivers; people living with dementia and their families; care professionals and researchers; Alzheimer advocates; and the general public. 

Alz.org provides general information about Alzheimer's disease and related dementias, and does not take the place of professional medical advice, diagnosis or treatment. If you have noticed possible symptoms of Alzheimer's disease in yourself or someone else, please see a doctor.

Content on our site is written by Alzheimer's Association staff members. It is reviewed by subject matter experts that include physicians, researchers and clinicians. 

We do not accept or host paid advertising on www.alz.org. The Alzheimer's Association and its website is supported by the generosity of our donors.
