##  Privacy Policy

The Alzheimer’s Association is committed to protecting the privacy of its users. Information gathered by the Association is used to monitor our site’s effectiveness and to respond to your questions and requests.

Through this site we collect information about the domain name of a visitor’s server (i.e., the name of the Internet service provider’s computer that funnels traffic to the Internet) but use it only for measurement purposes. We do not automatically collect e-mail addresses or other personal information unless you provide it on a form or survey. The information we collect is used in the following ways:

  * The Alzheimer’s Association does not sell, trade, or rent personal information about its Web site users. However, if a user donates to the Association, it is possible his or her name may be on some mailing lists shared with other organizations. As a donor, you may request to have your name removed from these mailing lists. Please e-mail us at [info@alz.org](mailto:info@alz.org) and provide your full name, mailing address, and a sentence requesting removal.

  * Some information is collected on the domain name of the server from where you are visiting. This information is used to determine the number of visitors to our site and sources of traffic. The data we collect are totals of those visiting from a domain, not information on individual users.

  * E-mail addresses provided to us are used to respond to requests and questions from our feedback forms, polls, and directed e-mails. These e-mail addresses may be used to distribute e-mail bulletins. In these cases, the user will have the opportunity to "unsubscribe" or request removal from future e-mail bulletin lists.

  * You may receive periodic mailings from the Alzheimer’s Association via the U.S. mail. If you do not wish to receive such mailings, please let us know by e-mailing us at [info@alz.org](mailto:info@alz.org). Please provide your full name, mailing address, and a sentence requesting suppression of your personal information in our files.




By using the Alzheimer’s Association Web site, you consent to the collection and use of the information described above. Any changes to this policy will be posted prior to their implementation.
