  * Some information is collected on the domain name of the server from where you are visiting. This information is used to determine the number of visitors to our site and sources of traffic. The data we collect are totals of those visiting from a domain, not information on individual users.

  * E-mail addresses provided to us are used to respond to requests and questions from our feedback forms, polls, and directed e-mails. These e-mail addresses may be used to distribute e-mail bulletins. In these cases, the user will have the opportunity to "unsubscribe" or request removal from future e-mail bulletin lists.
