We maintain reasonable administrative, technical and physical safeguards to protect Personal Information against loss, theft, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction as required by applicable law.  For instance, we use Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption, which is one of the leading security protocols for data transfers on the internet.  We also restrict access to your Personal Information to authorized staff with a legitimate and specific business purpose.

  * Security monitoring tools 
  * Regular network scans

To manage the cookies that are placed on your computer, you may configure your web browser to refuse, accept or delete cookies from our website at any time.  The help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether.  Turning off your browser's cookies will also limit the information collected by web beacons.  Please note that if cookies are disabled or removed, not all features of our website will operate as intended.
