Security and Privacy Policy

The Alzheimer’s Association is committed to protecting your privacy when you visit our Web site. Information we collect from you is used to improve our site, provide you a better experience, and respond to your questions and requests.

Information Collection

We collect two types of information on our Web site:

  1. _Web server traffic information._ This information is used to determine the number of visitors to our site, length of stay and sources of traffic. We collect aggregate data — or totals of those visiting from a domain — not information identifying individual users. We use this information to help improve our site and our service to you.

  2. _Personal information provided by you._ We collect e-mail addresses and other personal information only when you provide it to us. If you fill out a form or survey, request information or make a donation, we may collect your name, address, city, state, zip code, telephone number and e-mail address.




Use of Personal Information

The Alzheimer's Association collects information from different points on our Web site. We do not sell, trade or rent our Web site visitor’s personal information to others other than those outlined in this section. If you willingly provide us your personal information, the Alzheimer’s Association may use it in the following ways:

_Donations._ When you make an on-line donation to us, it’s possible your name may be on some mailing lists shared with other reputable organizations. As a donor, you may request to have your name removed from these mailing lists. See the Your Choice section below to learn how.

_E-mail Information Requests and Questions._ When we respond to your e-mail requests or questions, we may collect your e-mail address and send you Alzheimer’s Association e-mail bulletins or news. To opt out and remove your name from future e-mails, follow the unsubscribe instructions in the message. 

_Event Registration._ The Association provides on-line registration for our major events, such as the education and research conferences and our Memory Walk. We may collect your e-mail address and send you Alzheimer’s Association e-mail bulletins or news. To opt out and remove your name from future e-mails, follow the unsubscribe instructions in the message. 

_Write Congress:_ We track the number of letters sent to members of Congress on a password-protected Web site. At this time, we do not use personal information you provide us.

_Message Boards._ Please remember that any information you disclose on the message boards becomes public information.

Your Consent

By using the Alzheimer's Association Web site, you consent to the collection and use of the information described above. Any changes to this policy will be posted prior to their implementation.

Your Choice

We respect your privacy and recognize that you may wish to limit the ways in which we contact you. Simply send an e-mail to [info@alz.org](mailto:info@alz.org) with the following information:

  * To remove your name from mailing lists shared with other organizations, please provide your full name, mailing address and a sentence requesting removal. 

  * To remove your name from the Alzheimer's Association postal mailing list, please provide your full name, mailing address and a sentence requesting suppression of your personal information in our files.

  * To review or correct your personal information with the Alzheimer's Association, please provide your name and a sentence requesting a review or a correction.




Security

We take every precaution to protect your personal information. At the Alzheimer’s Association, your personal information is kept confidential and stored in a secure environment. Access to your information is restricted only to authorized staff with a legitimate and specific business purpose. For example, our finance employees need access to information to process on-line donations. If you have any questions about the security at our Web site, send an e-mail to [webmaster@alz.org](mailto:webmaster@alz.org).

Cookies

A cookie is a piece of data sent to your Web browser and stored on your hard drive. Cookies help us improve our Web site by tracking and targeting the interests of our users as they visit different sections of our site. Cookies do not contain any personal information. 

Log Files

We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track visitors’ movements and gather broad information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to personal information.

Pixels

The Alzheimer's Association uses pixels, or transparent GIF files, to help manage on-line advertising. These GIF files are provided by our ad management partner, DoubleClick. These files enable DoubleClick to recognize a unique cookie on your Web browser, which in turn enables us to learn which advertisements bring users to our Web site. The cookie was placed by us, or by another advertiser who works with DoubleClick. With both cookies and Spotlight technology, the information that we collect and share is anonymous and not personally identifiable. It does not contain your name, address, telephone number, or e-mail address. For more information about DoubleClick, including information about how to opt out of these technologies, go to: <http://www.doubleclick.net/us/corporate/privacy>.
