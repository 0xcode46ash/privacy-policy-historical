In conjunction with gathering information through cookies, our web servers may log information such as your device type, operating system type, browser type, domain, and other system settings, as well as the language your system uses and the country and time zone where your device is located.  The web server logs also may record information such as the address of the web page that referred you to our Site and the IP address of the device you use to connect to the Internet.  They also may log information about your interaction with this Site, such as which pages you visit.  To control which web servers collect information by automated means, we may place tags on our web pages called “Web beacons,” which are small files that link web pages to particular web servers and their cookies.  We also may send instructions to your device using JavaScript or other computer languages to gather the sorts of information described above and other details about your interactions with the Sites.  Both we and others (such as our service providers or advertising networks) may collect personal information about our visitors’ online activities over time and across third-party websites. Our Sites are not designed to respond to “do not track” signals received from browsers. 

We may use third-party web analytics services on our Sites, such as those of Piwik.  The information collected for this purpose (including your IP address, time of request, address of the web page that referred you to one of our Sites, browser characteristics, operating system characteristics and other information collected by automated means) may be disclosed to or collected directly by these service providers.  To learn about opting out of Piwik, please click on the appropriate button below. 

  
In addition, when you use our ALDI USA mobile application, we may collect certain information by automated means, including the application name, device type, version of the application and version of the operating system.

We may use the information collected through automated means to provide a more tailored shopping experience and for market research, data analytics and system administration purposes, such as to determine whether you’ve visited us before or are new to the Sites, and for compliance with our legal obligations, policies and procedures.  We also may use this information to target custom content and ads to you on the Sites and other websites, including as described in the Interest-Based Advertising section below. 

The providers of third-party plug-ins on our Sites, such as social sharing tools, may use automated means to collect information regarding your use of the Sites and your interactions with the plug-ins.  This information is subject to the privacy policies or notices of the plug-in providers and is not subject to this U.S. Online Privacy Notice.  We are not responsible for these providers’ information practices. 

## Interest-Based Advertising 

Data about your activities online is being collected on our Sites for use in providing advertising tailored to your individual interests.  You may choose whether or not to have your information collected for that purpose.  This section of the U.S. Online Privacy Notice provides details and explains how to exercise that choice. 

You may see certain ads on other websites because we participate in advertising networks administered by third parties.  These networks track your online activities over time by collecting information through automated means, including through the use of the technologies described in the “Information We Collect By Automated Means” section above, and they use this information to show you advertisements that are tailored to your individual interests.  The information they collect includes information about your visits to our Sites, such as the pages you have viewed.  This collection and ad targeting takes place both on our Sites and on third-party websites that participate in the ad networks, such as sites that feature advertisements delivered by the ad networks.  This process also helps us track the effectiveness of our marketing efforts.  To learn more about ad networks, including how to opt out, visit [www.aboutads.info/choices](http://www.aboutads.info/choices). 

## Information We Share

We do not sell or otherwise share personal information about you, except as described in this U.S. Online Privacy Notice.  We share personal information with third parties who perform services on our behalf.  We also may share the personal information we obtain with our affiliates.  When you enter a nickname after completing a game on our Sites, we may post the nickname and your score on a publicly available score list. 

Our Weekly Ads pages are operated by ShopLocal, LLC (“ShopLocal”), whose own privacy policies apply to the collection, use and disclosure of information obtained through the Weekly Ads pages by ShopLocal and its partners (such as ShopLocal’s ad networks).  ShopLocal may use browser and flash cookies, HTML 5 web storage, pixels and web beacons on our Weekly Ads pages.  Similarly, the collection, use and disclosure of information by social media sites in connection with ALDI’s social media pages and accounts, including on Facebook, Pinterest, Twitter and YouTube, is subject to those sites’ privacy policies.  The ALDI Photo Service (available at [](http://www.aldiphotos.us/)[www.aldiphotos.us](http://www.aldiphotos.us/)) is offered as a service to our customers and operated by MEDION (not ALDI).  MEDION’s own privacy policies apply to the collection, use and disclosure of information obtained through the ALDI Photo Service.  Click [_here_](http://www.aldiphotos.us/data-protection.html) for MEDION’s online Privacy Policy. 

We also may disclose information about you (i) if we are required to do so by law, regulation or legal process (such as a court order or subpoena), (ii) in response to requests by government agencies, such as law enforcement authorities, or (iii) when we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to prevent physical harm or financial loss or in connection with an investigation of suspected or actual illegal activity.  We reserve the right to transfer any information we have about you in the event we sell or transfer all or a portion of our business or assets (including in the event of a reorganization, dissolution or liquidation).
