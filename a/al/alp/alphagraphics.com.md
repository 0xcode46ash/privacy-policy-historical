In addition, AlphaGraphics also collects nonpersonal information in the aggregate, such as what pages site visitors access and how often.

We may share aggregate information about our users with advertisers, business partners, sponsors and other third parties without your permission. In the event that we are acquired, merged or sell certain of our assets, then your personally identifiable information may be transferred and become subject to a different privacy policy.

From time to time, our site requests information from users via surveys. Participation in these surveys is completely voluntary, and therefore, the user has a choice whether or not to disclose information. Information requested may include contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code, age level). Contact information will be used to notify the winners and award prizes if applicable. Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this site.

## Security

This Web site takes precautions to protect our users’ information. When users submit sensitive information via the Web site, their information is protected both online and offline. When our registration form requests sensitive information (such as a credit card number), that information is encrypted using Secure Socket Layer or SSL.

While we use encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also take reasonable steps to protect user information offline. All of our users’ information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job are granted access to personally identifiable information. Although we take appropriate measures to safeguard against unauthorized disclosures of information, we cannot assure you that personally identifiable information that we collect will never be disclosed in a manner that is inconsistent with this privacy policy. Please note, however, that information disclosed online is never 100% secure and that protection of passwords and other information controlled by you is your responsibility. If you have any questions about the security at our website, you can send an e-mail to Webmaster.

AlphaGraphics may disclose user data if it feels that user has provided fraudulent or illegal information, has attempted to pose as someone else or has attempted an unauthorized access of user’s computer systems. Persons responsible for attempting unauthorized access of AlphaGraphics’ computer systems will be prosecuted to the fullest extent permitted by law.

## Correction/Updating Personal Information

If a user’s personally identifiable information (such as zip code) changes, or if a user no longer desires our services, we will endeavor to provide a way to correct, update or remove that user’s personal data provided to us. This can usually be done by emailing the AlphaGraphics Webmaster.

Users who no longer wish to receive our newsletter may opt out of receiving these communications by following the instructions listed at the bottom of the newsletter e-mail.

## Notification of Changes

If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it and under circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If at any point we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify users by posting on our Web site. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner. We will use information in accordance with the most current privacy policy
