Privacy Policy

Disclosure of information to third parties:

Your personal information is used by us in order to process and ship your orders. Personal information includes your name, e-mail address, mailing address, method of payment information and other data that identifies you as an individual. If necessary, we might use this information to contact you for help processing the order. We respect your privacy. Our secure server software encrypts all personal information, ensuring that your information stays private and protected. Aggregate information is general in nature and does not contain any personally identifying information. Aggregate information about traffic patterns, sales, and other site information may be shared with partners, vendors, and other reputable third parties.

We will _**NOT**_ sell your personal information to third parties!

Safety and Security

Shopping with ShopAlphaindustries.com is safe and secure. We ensure that it's safe by transferring all of your personal information, including your name, address and credit card, over a Secure Socket Layer (SSL) line. This ensures that your information is encrypted and cannot be read by others as it travels over the Internet. The secure mode begins when you initiate your order. You will know you're in secure mode when the tiny padlock icon (located at the bottom of your browser) appears as "locked." You also can verify you are in secure mode by looking at the URL line of your browser. When accessing a secure server, the first characters of the site address will change from "http" to "https." And after the information reaches us, it is stored on a secure server, resides behind a firewall and cannot be accessed from outside the company. At that point, your information can only be accessed by employees to process your orders. We guarantee every transaction as 100% safe and secure.
