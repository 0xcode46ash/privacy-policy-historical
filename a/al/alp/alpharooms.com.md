###  Direct Marketing 

We will not provide your personal information to any third parties for the purpose of direct marketing unless you have provided your express consent by activating the "opt-in" option on the Website. In such cases, we shall only transfer to the third party that data which is necessary to allow you to receive this direct marketing (e.g. name, address and email addresses). You may remove your consent at any time after which we will no longer disclose your information. Each relevant third party will show their contact information in their marketing material. We have no control over such third party marketing material, we therefore disclaim all liability that may arise from such third party marketing material. 

You expressly agree to such uses of your personal information. 

##  5\. Who we share your information with 

Your information is shared with hotel, airline, car rental, and other providers, who offer their products and services for sale through this Website (“Travel Providers”) and our employees, officers, agents and service providers in order to process your booking requests, provide other services you have asked for, process information or manage aspects of our Website. For example, we give your details to the hotel you have booked. We do not share your information for marketing purposes unless you have specifically agreed that we may do this. 

Information that you provide may be stored and processed in and transferred between any of the countries in which our Travel Providers operate. Where necessary to deliver the services you have asked for, information which you provide may therefore be transferred to countries which do not have data protection laws equivalent to those in force in the European Economic Area (EEA), in particular where your booking destination is outside the EEA. Where this is the case, we take all reasonable steps to ensure that appropriate protection of your data is maintained. Please note, if we cannot pass this information to the relevant Travel Providers, whether in the EEA or not, we cannot provide the services to you. 

We may disclose your personal information: 

  * to the extent that we are required to do so by law; 
  * in connection with any legal proceedings or prospective legal proceedings; 
  * for the purposes of fraud prevention; 
  * to a prospective purchaser of any business or asset which we are contemplating selling 



You expressly agree to such transfers and disclosures of your personal information. 

##  6\. How we protect your information 

While we cannot guarantee the security of data sent over the internet, we have implemented appropriate administrative, technical, and physical security procedures to help prevent the loss, misuse or unauthorised alteration of the personal information you provide to us. In particular we use encryption when transmitting sensitive personal information (such as credit card details) and we employ firewalls and intrusion detection systems to help prevent unauthorised access to your information. 

You are responsible for keeping your password and user details confidential. We will not ask you for your password (except when you log in to the Website). 

##  7\. Your Rights 

You may instruct us to provide you with any personal information we hold about you. Provision of such information will be subject to: 

  * the payment of a fee (currently £10.00); and 
  * the supply of appropriate evidence of your identity (for this purpose, we will usually accept a photocopy of your passport certified by a solicitor or bank plus an original copy of a utility bill showing your current address). 



We may withhold such personal information to the extent permitted by law. 

Please note that details of any bookings you have made with us can be viewed by logging in through the 'Manage my booking' section of our website. 

We ask you to opt in before we use your personal information for marketing purposes. If at any time you wish to opt out you can do so by clicking the “unsubscribe” link contained in each marketing communication. Alternatively you can write to us requesting this removal at the address shown in Section 10 of this Privacy Policy. 

We will correct any inaccuracies in any personal information we hold about you free of charge.
