### Data collection

Alpari UK will only collect personal data when you specifically and knowingly provide it to us.

This process may be conducted using information provided by identification verification agencies and you may be asked to supply additional information to support any unsuccessful verification attempts.

We may use the personal information you provide to contact you in the future about Alpari UK products and/or services, where you have consented to be contacted for such purposes. We will also use data held on you for the purposes of (i) ensuring the content on the Site is presented in the most effective manner, (ii) carrying out our obligations arising from any agreements entered into between Alpari UK and you, and (iii) notifying you about changes to our products and/or services.

Alpari UK will keep personal data only as long as it is necessary, including for the purposes of updating the product or services or as required by law. When the personal data is no longer required, it will be destroyed either by shredding or other approved destruction methods to prevent unauthorised parties from gaining access to the information during and after the process.

We will safeguard information in our custody.

We have developed and will maintain security procedures to safeguard personal data against loss, theft, copying and unauthorised disclosure, use or modification. Access to personal data is restricted to employees and authorised service providers who need it to perform their work.
