## 9\. Web analytics services & Retargeting

### 9.1 Google Analytics

This website uses Google Analytics, a web analytics service offered by the company Google Inc (Google). Google Analytics uses so-called cookies, small tags, which are stored on the hard disk of your computer and allow the analytics of the use of the website.

The information originated by the cookies through the usage of this website would be transmitted and stored in a Google data collection server in the USA. In case of activation of the IP anonymization on this website, the IP address will be abbreviated by Google within Member States of the European Union or other parties of the Agreement on the European Economic Area. Only in exceptional cases would the full IP address be sent to a Google data collection server in the USA and abbreviated there. We inform you herewith that this site uses Google Analytics using the anonymization procedure and therefore the IP addresses are processed only abbreviated so that any personal identification is excluded.

On behalf of the operator of this website, Google will only use this information to evaluate your use of the website, to compile reports about website activity and to provide the use of other connected services to the website operator. The IP address sent by your browser within the scope of Google Analytics will not be associated to other Google data. You may determine whether cookies should be stored by activating the corresponding browser settings. However, we inform you that as far as the cookies are not allowed, our website may not be used in its entirety.

You may also prevent the coverage of the generated data and the use of the website related data (including your IP address) by Google as well as the processing of these data by Google. If you wish to opt out you should click following link to download and install the add-on: http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=de.

ou may find further information concerning terms of use and data protection under http://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/terms/ or under http://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/. We inform you that Google Analytics has adjusted on this website the code „gat._anonymizeIp();" in order to assure an anonymous collection of IP-Addresses (so-called IP-Masking).

### 9.2. Using the Google Inc. Remarketing feature

We use the "Remarketing" feature offered by Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, US ("Google") on our website. This feature allows us to readdress users who have visited our website in a targeted way through pinpointed advertising on Google's Partner Network pages. Personalised, interest-based advertisements can then be displayed on other websites that the user may visit within the Google Display Network. Cookies are used to display these advertisements. Cookies are small text files that are stored on a user's computer. These text files help to collect anonymised data about the use of the website, which cannot be traced back to an individual.

You can permanently disable Google's use of cookies by clicking on the following link and downloading and installing the available plugin: https://www.google.com/settings/ads/plugin. Alternatively, you can disable the use of cookies by third-party providers by accessing the Network Advertising Initiative's deactivation page at http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/ and following the more detailed information provided there about opting out.

You can find information about the type, scope and purpose of the collection, usage and further processing or usage of the data by Google, as well as your rights and settings options for protection of user privacy in Google's privacy terms at http://www.google.com/privacy/ads/.

### 9.3. Retargeting

Similar as in Google Analytics, this webpage collects data through following services:

  * Criteo, web analytics service of the provider Criteo SA, 32 Rue Blanche, 75009 Paris, France
  * Sociomantic, web analytics service of the provider sociomantic labs GmbH, Münzstrasse 19, 10178 Berlin, Germany



From the data collected and stored through these web analysis services user profiles are created using pseudonyms. These web analytics services analyze the browsing behaviour based on an algorithm and can make targeted product recommendations as personalized banners on the websites (so-called publishers). These data will never be used to identify visitors of this website. Data collection and storage for the purpose of web analytics through these services can be cancelled at any time with effect for the future by following the instructions on each of the following websites:

  * Criteo: http://www.criteo.com/de/datenschutzrichtlinie
  * Sociomantic: https://www.sociomantic.com/privacy/de/#opt-out-header



### 9.4. Storm Reporting (DC Storm)

This website uses Storm Reporting, web analytics software of the provider DC Storm Ltd. (DC Storm). Storm Reporting uses so-called „Cookies". These are small tags, which are stored on the hard disk of your computer in order to obtain anonymous information on the visit to our website.

The stored information may include:

  * A randomly generated, unique identifier used to identify the revisit of the same visitor.
  * Sites, sessions and hit counters in order to capture the time and number of pages visited by a visitor. 
  * If any, the URL (referred) of the page from which a visitor comes to the website. This will be disguised by means of a hashing algorithm in the cookie. In this way could be coded "http://www.google.com/search?q=dcstorm" in, for example, "12345678|560868". This serves to avoid duplicates of new visits. This cookie loses its validity 20 minutes after being generated.



The IP address of the website visitor will not be stored by DC Storm. Due to technical reasons, this will be transmitted by each server request, but anonymized before any processing takes place (e.g. geolocalisation) and then deleted. Therefore, no IP address can be identified or neither any conclusion can be drawn to identify the person.

The collected and anonymized data will be sent and stored to a DC Storm server in the UK. Delivery and/or processing of data outside the territory of the States of the European Community do not take place. DC Storm will provide third parties with this information if required by law.

By using this website, you agree to that website-data will be collected and anonymously stored as above described.

We take your privacy very seriously and do not provide third parties with the data collected. The data collected will be used only for evaluation and optimization of our website.

You can disable the saving of cookies by your browser. We inform you that this may limit the use of the site and that under certain circumstances you will not be able to use all functions completely. Through following link you may disagree on the data collection and storage through DS Storm on the website dc-storm.de:

Stop data collection through DC Storm from the website Alpinetrek.co.uk.

That objection will be stored in a special cookie (_#uid) and will be valid as long as the cookie is not deleted.

## 10\. Social Plugins: Facebook/Twitter

Social plugins (programs) of the external providers Facebook and Twitter are integrated on our internet domain.

### 10.1. Facebook

We use the "Like button", the "Share button" as well as the "social plugins" of Facebook. These plugins are operated by Facebook Inc., 1601 S. California Ave, Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA. You may recognize them through the corresponding Facebook logo. Further information related to Facebook social plugins under: https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/.

When a visitor enters a site of our Internet domain that contains such plugin, a connection between the browser of the visitor and Facebook server will be created. Facebook receives and stores data (such as IP address and cookie ID) in order to facilitate Facebook to recognize which site from our Internet presence has been visited. This happens regardless of whether the visitor activates a Facebook plugin or not. In case that a visitor activates a Facebook plugin, the corresponding information will be sent to Facebook in the USA and stored there. In case that the visitor is logged in his personal Facebook account at the same time, the forwarded data may be assigned to the specific account. Facebook uses cookies for this purpose – for both registered and unregistered users.

Nature, scope, collection purpose, use and further processing and use of data by Facebook as well as rights and possibilities to protect the privacy of the user may be viewed and edited within the Facebook data use policy (https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy). Further, the exact data processing or storage periods and purposes are unclear.

This website uses the communication tool Conversion Tracking Pixel by Facebook Inc., 1601 S. California Ave, Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA ("Facebook"). We integrate so-called Facebook pixels in our page for that purpose. Once you have viewed or clicked a Facebook ad, you will be tagged as a visitor of our website and we will be able to follow your activities on our website. The captured data is anonymous, i.e. we will be unable to view personal data of individual users and specifically cannot connect activities on our website to any individual; we will only be able to analyse the Facebook ads for statistical and/or market research purposes. The captured data will, however, be stored and processed by Facebook and may be brought into connection with your Facebook profile. Facebook is then entitled to utilise that information in compliance with the Facebook Data Policy (https//www.facebook.com/about/privacy). You have the option of permitting or refusing Facebook and its partners to display adverts on and outside of Facebook as part of your personal profile settings on Facebook.

You can refuse the use of the Conversion Tracking Pixel on your Facebook profile here: https://www.facebook.com/settings/?tab=ads

### 10.2. Twitter

We use the Twitter button of Twitter. This plugin is operated by Twitter Inc., 795 Folsom St., Suite 600, San Francisco, CA 94107, USA. You may recognize it through the corresponding Twitter logo. Further information related to Twitter social plugins under: https://dev.twitter.com/web/overview.

When a visitor enters a site of our Internet domain that contains such plugin, a connection between the browser of the visitor and Twitter server will be created. Twitter receives and stores data (such as IP address) in order to facilitate Twitter to recognize which site from our Internet presence has been visited. This happens regardless of whether the visitor activates a Twitter plugin or not. In case that a visitor activates a Twitter plugin, the corresponding information will be sent to Twitter in the USA and stored there. In case that the visitor is logged in his personal Twitter account at the same time, the forwarded data may be assigned to the specific account.

Nature, scope, collection purpose, use and further processing and use of data by Twitter as well as rights and possibilities to protect the privacy of the user may be viewed and edited within the Twitter privacy policy (http://twitter.com/privacy).
