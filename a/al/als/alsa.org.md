### I. Privacy Policy Statement

The ALS Association is committed to protecting the privacy of its users. Information gathered by ALSA is used to monitor the effectiveness of our site and respond to your questions and requests. 

**Aggregate Information**  
When you visit our Web site, our server automatically logs (records) domain name and standard anonymous information about the operating system and Web browser you are using, as provided by your Web browser. This automatically collected information is used for statistical purposes to help us manage our site and better serve the community, but it does not identify you in any way. 

**Identifiable Information**  
Those of you who volunteer information about yourself by filling out an interactive form on ALSA's Web site (such as the "Library Order Form," "Donation Form," "Become an ALSA Advocate" or "Keep Me Informed" request), may be interested to know ALSA's Information Sharing Policy, which is as follows: 

  * The ALS Association does not rent or share donor information. If requests for donor information come from an ALSA Chapter or authorized affiliate entity, a cooperative effort will be made to understand the nature of the request and attempts will be made to provide alternate means to accomplish the desired end. 
  * A donor/prospect will be deemed the donor/prospect of the ALSA chartered affiliate entity establishing the initial contact. Where a donor/prospect expresses and alternative preference, that request shall, where feasible, be honored. 
  * ALSA affiliate entities will submit on an on-going basis as soon as practical addition and changes to records of patients associated with their entity. ALSA chapters may indicate that any individual (patient or other supporter) whose record is newly provided by their chapter to ALSA is not to be solicited by the National Office and except as may herein be provided, and that record will be coded as such. 
  * Whenever reasonable and possible, representatives of The ALS Association will endeavor to educate donors/prospects about the respective roles and responsibility of it's affiliate in order to assist donors/prospects in the contribution decisions. 
  * Patient and family information, including, but not limited to, name, address, age and telephone number, is confidential and will only be shared with ALSA entities with written permission from a patient or their designee (except to provide appropriate ALSA affiliated entities the names and phone numbers of patients and family members who call ALSA's 800 number information and referral service seeking information or help and give their verbal permission for their names to be passed on so the local ALSA entity can provide such help). Under no circumstances will ALSA provide information to outside entities, except where required by law and then only after providing notice to the patient and/or designee. ALSA will, upon request of a patient or their designee or caretaker, serve as an intermediary between patients and outside entities where deemed appropriate. 
  * ALSA may provide to government agencies and outside entities aggregate data on ALS including incidence and prevalence and number of patients served by ALSA.
