# Albertsons - Security & Privacy

Albertsons.com believes that our customers are our greatest asset. We built this Web site on that premise and, in doing so, have made every effort to ensure that your shopping experience is enjoyable, safe, and secure. We gather information from you so that we may process orders, offer special purchasing opportunities, and tailor your visit to our Web site toward your interests. This page details our practices with regard to information that you submit to our Web site.

Your Personal Information  
Our Web site's registration form requires you to give us contact information (like your name and e-mail address), unique identifiers (like a unique user name), and demographic information (like your zip code and age). When contacting our Customer Service team from any of our web sites, you will be providing us your e-mail address for direct communication between Customer Service and yourself only. Albertsons.com will not sell your personal information to third parties. Your contact information is used to contact you with questions regarding your order. Demographic and profile data is also collected at our Web site. We use this data to tailor your experience at our Web site, showing you content that we think you might be interested in, and displaying the content according to your preferences. This information is stored in your file in a secure environment separate from our Web site.

At any time, you may access all your personal information that we collect online and maintain, by logging on to albertsons.com, using your login and password. Then click the green ‘My Account’ tab at the top of the page to view your order history and personal information. We use this procedure to better safeguard your information. You can also correct factual errors in your personal information by sending a request to [cs_online@albertsons.com](mailto:cs_online@albertsons.com). To protect your privacy and security, we will also take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access or making corrections.

Albertsons.com uses an order form for you to request information, products, and services.

We run contests on our Web site in which we ask you for contact information (like your name and e-mail address). Your contact information will be used to contact you if you're a prizewinner.
