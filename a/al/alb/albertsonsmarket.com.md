**ALBERTSON’S LLC:   PRIVACY STATEMENT**

## Privacy Statement

Albertson’s LLC (“Albertsons”) respects the privacy of users of www.Albertsonsmarket.com (the "Site"). This Privacy Statement discloses how we collect and use information on the Site, and the choices that you can make about the way your information is collected and used.

**1\. INFORMATION COLLECTION AND USE**  
Portions of the Site may allow users to make online requests for information, submit comments regarding ALBERTSONS’ operations, register for certain services online, or inquire about opportunities for employment or other business transactions with ALBERTSONS. These portions of the site will require the user to provide personally identifiable contact information. ALBERTSONS uses the information you provide for the purposes stated at the point of collection. For example, ALBERTSONS routes the information internally to the individual or department best able to respond to your inquiry, and uses your contact information to respond to or follow-up regarding your inquiry. ALBERTSONS does not maintain a central database of user information obtained from users who have requested information from ALBERTSONS.  
(a) Sharing of Information. ALBERTSONS does not sell or rent personally identifiable user information collected about or from our users. In the event that ALBERTSONS sells or acquires business assets or concerns, in whole or in part, ALBERTSONS may transfer user information in conjunction with such sale or acquisition.  
(b) Web Traffic Monitoring. ALBERTSONS uses analytical software to track page views, user sessions, IP addresses, general geographic location of visitors, and similar information regarding the use of the web site in an effort to understand how visitors experience the Site and how we may improve the Site. ALBERTSONS does not normally link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable, which means that your session will be logged, but you remain anonymous to us. ALBERTSONS may use IP addresses to identify a user when we feel it is necessary to enforce compliance with the Site's Terms of Use or to protect our service, the Site, our customers or others, or in response to requests or subpoenas by law-enforcement authorities.

**2\. CONSENT TO PRIVACY STATEMENT**   
By providing the information requested by the Site, or by continuing to use the Site after having an opportunity to review the Privacy Statement, you have consented to the terms of the Privacy Statement, and ALBERTSONS' use of the information it collects as described at the point of collection or in this Privacy Statement. If you do not agree to the Privacy Statement, you may not use the Site.  
ALBERTSONS reserves the right to modify the Privacy Statement at any time without giving you prior notice. Any updates or material changes to this Privacy Statement will be posted here, and the last date of modification will be noted. Your use of the Site following any such modification constitutes your agreement to follow and be bound by the Privacy Statement as modified. The last date the Privacy Statement was revised is set forth below.  
Because ALBERTSONS does not maintain a central database of user information obtained from users who have requested information via the site, the Site does not provide a mechanism to opt-out of receiving future communications from ALBERTSONS. Should you wish to cease communications with a particular individual or department within ALBERTSONS from whom or from which you have requested information, you may inform that individual or department of your wishes at any time. ALBERTSONS’ policy is to respect such requests.

(a) Children and Privacy. The Site is not intended for use by children. ALBERTSONS encourages parents and guardians to be familiar with the web sites that their children visit. The Federal Trade Commission ("FTC") regulates the means by which web site operators collect and use personal information from children under 13, pursuant to the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (the "Act"). For more information about the Act and children's on-line privacy in general, visit the FTC's web site at http://www.ftc.gov. ALBERTSONS generally does not collect or distribute personal information from its users, including its users under 13. To the extent that some of the features and services provided in conjunction with the Site require a user to disclose personal information, ALBERTSONS requests that children under 13 refrain from using these features or obtain permission from a parent or guardian before using the features. Users under 13 are prohibited from posting any personal information on the Site or any other ALBERTSONS web site. ALBERTSONS relies on its users to comply with the provisions of this section.  
(b) Links to Other Sites. The Site contains links to other web sites. Each of these linked web sites maintains its own independent privacy policies. ALBERTSONS does not control and is not responsible for the privacy policies or the content of those web sites. When you leave the Site and access the web sites of third parties, the privacy policies of the parties maintaining those web sites apply.  
(c) Disclaimer of Liability. Under no circumstances shall ALBERTSONS, its parent entities, or any subsidiary or affiliate be liable for any damages, including, but not limited to, special, incidental, consequential or exemplary damages, that result from the use of the information or materials posted to or collected as a result of the user's access of the Site, even if ALBERTSONS has been advised of the possibility of such damages. This and the other sections in the Privacy Statement should be read in conjunction with and are subject to the Terms of Use.
