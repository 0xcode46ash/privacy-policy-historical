**Albertson’s LLC Privacy Policy**

Albertson’s LLC respects your privacy and is committed to safeguarding your personally identifiable information or “personal information” from unauthorized use or disclosure. This policy describes how your personal information may be collected when you visit our website, shop at our stores, use our products or access our services, or otherwise interact with us. It also describes how your personal information is used or disclosed and the steps we take to protect it from unauthorized use or disclosure. For special offers, promotions, contests or specific services, such as those provided by our pharmacies, we might advise you that additional or different personal information practices or terms exist. You should refer to those terms or practices as well.

**CONSENT TO PRIVACY POLICY**

By accessing our website or obtain information or services or providing personal information to us through other means, you are agreeing to the terms of this Privacy Policy.

**DEFINITION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION**

We define the term “personal information” to mean any information that we directly associate with or use to identify a specific person. This may include an address, phone number, email address, fax number, online registration or financial account, when associated with a person’s name. Our definition does not include “aggregate personal information,” which is information that we collect about a group or category of persons or services, or “de-identified information,” which is information from which we or our agents have removed any information that can be used to specifically identify a person, and this policy does not restrict or limit our collection or use of those types of information.

**COLLECTION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION**

We may collect your personal information through one or more of the following methods.

  * **Personal Information You Provide.** We may request or give you the opportunity to provide personal information when you register as a user of our website, shop in our stores, sign up for or use our products or services, cash a check, contact us about a prior purchase, or email, call, or otherwise communicate with us. For example, if you enter an on-line sweepstakes, we may request that you provide your telephone number. If you do not provide such information, your participation in such program may be limited. Similarly, if you contact us regarding a product or service that you are interested in or concerned about, we may request that you provide personal information that will enable us to respond to your inquiry.


  * **Automatically Collected Personal Information.** When you shop at our stores, or register for or use our services, transactional information such as the date of your purchase, registration or service usage, their descriptions and if applicable, the dollar amount or value of the transaction may be collected automatically. We treat this information as personal information if we combine it with or link it to other information that may identify you.


  * **Other Information.** We may obtain information about you from third parties such as demographic marketing information, address verification, or mailing list information and combine it with other personal information pertaining to you.


  * **Cookies, Web Beacons and Similar Technologies.** We may use cookies, web beacons and similar technologies to manage our website and email messages, and we may collect information about your activities online at our website. We may link this information with other personal information about you. We may also allow third parties to serve ads on our websites, and if you visit their websites, they may collect information about your visit. This Privacy Policy does not apply to, and we are not responsible for, the practices of third parties that collect your personal information. We encourage you to check the privacy policies of such third parties to learn about their practices with respect to the collection, use, disclosure and protection of your personal information.



**OUR USE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION**

We may use your personal information for a variety of purposes, including but not limited to:

  * Responding to your requests
  * Processing and completing your transactions, including the delivery of products or services
  * Contacting you about products or services that we believe may be of interest to you, or sharing with you special offers from other companies
  * Conducting market research, surveys and similar inquiries to help us understand trends and customer needs across product categories or customer groups
  * Evaluating your shopping experience or existing products and services, or to create new items
  * Attempting to contact you regarding product safety or recall issues
  * Entering you into sweepstakes and promotions
  * Verifying and validating your identity
  * Keeping a record of our interactions with you if you place an order or otherwise deal with our representatives over the telephone or online
  * Preventing, investigating or providing notice of fraud, unlawful or criminal activity, or unauthorized access to or use of personal information, our website or data systems; or to meet legal obligations



**DISCLOSURE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION**

We do not sell or rent your personal information to third parties in the ordinary course of our business, nor do we share it with them for their own direct marketing purposes. Notwithstanding, upon the occurrence of certain corporate transactions, your personal information may be disclosed or transferred as described under the caption “Certain Business Transfers” below. We may also share your personal information with our parent corporation or affiliated companies for their use in a manner similar to the purposes described above under the caption “Our Use of Personal Information.” Our practices with respect to the disclosure of personal information are described below.

  * **With Your Consent.** We may disclose your personal information to third parties with your consent. You may give your consent in several ways, such as through a written agreement that you sign or acknowledge; an online method, such as a “clickthrough” agreement or registration page; an oral statement, such as by way of an interactive voice response; or through the terms and conditions under which we provide you a particular product or service. Sometimes your consent may be implicit. For example, if you purchase products with a credit card and have them shipped to your home, you implicitly consent to the disclosure of your name and address to a third-party shipping company to complete the delivery, and of your credit card number to the credit card processor to authorize the transaction and to the bank to collect payment.


  * **Service Providers.** We may disclose your personal information to third parties who complete transactions or perform services on our behalf or for your benefit. Information provided to such parties for payment authorization or verification purposes may be retained by them in a database that is used to provide similar services to others. We may also utilize the services of third parties to verify customer data, such as mailing addresses or to supplement other information we have collected. We may also contract with third parties to host a site, conduct market research, or send you information regarding our products or services, or those of other companies with whom we conduct business.


  * **Legal Process.** We may disclose your personal information to legal or government regulatory authorities in response to their requests for such information or to assist in investigations of theft, fraud or abuse. We may also disclose your personal information to third parties in connection with claims, disputes or litigation, or if we determine its disclosure is necessary in an emergency.


  * **Certain Business Transfers.** Your personal information may be disclosed as part of a corporate business transaction, such as a merger, acquisition, joint venture, or financing or sale of company assets, and could be transferred to a third party as one of the business assets in such a transaction. It may also be disclosed in the event of insolvency, bankruptcy or receivership.



**HEALTH INFORMATION/PHARMACIES**

Our pharmacies collect protected health information, which includes your medical and personal history, prescription profile for fulfillment of pharmacy orders, and other health-related information that you, your doctor or your insurance carrier provides to us. This information is most often used to process your prescriptions, provide you with health care information or services, or to contact you with questions and respond to your inquiries. This information is subject to our notice of privacy practices that more specifically describes how we may use or disclose your protected health information. You may request a copy of our notice of privacy practices when you visit any of our pharmacies or by contacting us using one of the methods listed under the caption “How to Contact Us” that appears below.

**INFORMATION PERTAINING TO CHILDREN**

We do not intend to or knowingly collect personal information online from children under the age of 13, and we encourage parents or guardians to participate in and monitor their children’s online activity. If a child under 13 has provided personal information, a parent or guardian may inform us of that fact by contacting us using one of the methods listed under the caption “How to Contact Us” that appears below, and we will then delete the information from our database. If you are under the age of 13, do not provide us with any personal information either directly, on any website bulletin boards or by other means.

**ACCESS TO AND RETENTION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION**

We do not maintain all of your personal information in a form that you can access or update, and some items, such as transaction records, may not be changed. Accordingly, we will determine and may limit what may be accessed and how, and we may keep a record of changes (including deletions) and disclose them for lawful purposes. We keep your personal information for as long as we think is necessary or advisable, and we reserve the right to retain it to the full extent not prohibited by law. You may review your personal information that is readily accessible or request that it be updated by contacting our Customer Interaction Center using one of the methods listed under the caption “How to Contact Us” that appears below.

**SECURITY OF PERSONAL INFORMATION**

We take various physical, electronic and procedural measures to protect your personal information from unauthorized disclosure or misuse. We employ Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology, a commonly employed method of encrypted communication used on the Internet, to encrypt during transmission, sensitive personal information you input, including credit card numbers. However, because no data security systems are completely secure, we do not warrant that any personal information that you provide to us will be secure or safe from unauthorized access. If you provide any personal information to us, you do so at your own risk.

**LINKS TO OTHER WEBSITES**

Our website may contain links to websites operated by third parties. When you visit their websites, they may collect information about your visit and use it to provide advertisements to you. This Privacy Policy does not apply to, and we are not responsible for, the practices of third parties that collect your personal information. Each of these linked websites may maintain its own policies about the collection, use and protection of your personal information. We encourage you to check the privacy policies of such third parties to learn about their practices.

**CHANGES TO THIS POLICY**

We will modify this Privacy Policy if our practices change. We will notify you of such changes by posting the modified version on our website and indicating the date it was last modified. We encourage you to visit our website periodically to view the latest version of this Privacy Policy.

**NOTICE OF PRIVACY PRACTICES**

**THIS NOTICE DESCRIBES HOW MEDICAL INFORMATION ABOUT YOU MAY BE USED AND DISCLOSED AND HOW YOU CAN GET ACCESS TO THIS INFORMATION. PLEASE REVIEW IT CAREFULLY.**

Albertsons is committed to protecting your privacy and understands the importance of safeguarding your personal health information. We are required by federal law to maintain the privacy of health information that identifies you or that could be used to identify you (known as “Protected Health Information”). We also are required to provide you with this Notice, which explains our legal duties and privacy practices with respect to Protected Health Information that we collect and maintain. This Notice describes your rights under federal law and state law, where applicable, relating to your Protected Health Information. Albertsons is required by federal law to abide by this Notice. However, we reserve the right to change the privacy practices outlined in this Notice and make the new practices effective for all Protected Health Information that we maintain. Should we make such a change, we will display the revised Notice at our pharmacies and make it available to you upon request.

**Uses and Disclosures of Protected Health Information**

**Routine Uses and Disclosures of Protected Health Information For Treatment, Payment, or Health Care Operations**

Albertsons is permitted under federal law to use and disclose Protected Health Information without your specific permission for three types of routine purposes: treatment, payment, and health care operations.

Your pharmacist will use or disclose your Protected Health Information as described below. Your Protected Health Information may be used and disclosed by your pharmacist, pharmacy staff, and others outside of the pharmacy that are involved in your care and treatment. Set out below are examples of the uses and disclosures of your Protected Health Information we are permitted to make for these routine purposes. While this list is not meant to be exhaustive, it should give you an idea of the everyday uses and disclosures “behind the scenes” that are essential to the care you receive.

**Treatment.** Your Protected Health Information can be used and disclosed by Albertsons for treatment purposes. For example, your Protected Health Information will be used by our pharmacists to fill your prescription and to counsel you about the appropriate use of your medication.

We also may use and disclose your Protected Health Information to provide you with information regarding possible alternative treatment options and other health-related benefits and services that we believe might interest you. For example, we may send you reminders to refill your prescription, information about the availability of cheaper generic alternatives for your prescription, or information about new or updated products that may enhance or improve your treatment.

**Payment.** Your Protected Health Information can be used and disclosed for payment purposes. For example, we may communicate your Protected Health Information to your insurance company so that it can process payment for your prescription.

**Health Care Operations.** Your Protected Health Information can be used and disclosed to allow us to conduct health care operations, which generally are the administrative activities that we undertake in order to operate our pharmacies. For example, we may use your Protected Health Information to evaluate the performance of our pharmacists and to engage in other quality assurance activities.

**Other Uses and Disclosures of Protected Health Information Albertsons is Permitted or Required to Make Without Your Authorization**

In general, we are required to obtain your specific written authorization to use or disclose your Protected Health Information for purposes unrelated to treatment, payment, or health care operations. However, there are exceptions to this general rule under which we are permitted or required to make certain uses and disclosures of your Protected Health Information without authorization. These situations include:

**Required by the Secretary of Health and Human Services.** We may be required to disclose your Protected Health Information to the Secretary of Health and Human Services to investigate or determine our compliance with the federal privacy law.

**Required by Law.** We may use or disclose your Protected Health Information to the extent that the use or disclosure is otherwise required by state or federal law.

**Public Health.** We may disclose your Protected Health Information for public health activities, such as disclosures to a public health authority or other government agency that is permitted by law to collect or receive the information (e.g., the Food and Drug Administration).

**Abuse or Neglect.** If you have been a victim of abuse, neglect, or domestic violence, we may disclose your Protected Health Information to the government agency authorized to receive such information.

**Health Oversight.** We may disclose Protected Health Information to a health oversight agency for activities authorized by law, such as: civil or criminal investigations; inspections; licensure or disciplinary actions; or other activities necessary for appropriate oversight of retail pharmacies, governmental health benefit programs, or compliance with laws.

**Judicial and Administrative Proceedings.** We may disclose Protected Health Information in response to a court or agency order, and in some cases, in response to a subpoena or other lawful process not accompanied by a court order.

**Law Enforcement.** We may disclose Protected Health Information for law enforcement purposes, such as providing information to the police about the victim of a crime.

**Coroners, Medical Examiners, and Funeral Directors.** We may disclose Protected Health Information to a coroner, medical examiner, or funeral director if it is needed to carry out their duties.

**Research.** We may disclose your Protected Health Information to researchers when the research is being conducted under established protocols to ensure the privacy of your information.

**Serious Threat to Health or Safety.** Your Protected Health Information may be disclosed if we believe it is necessary to prevent a serious and imminent threat to the public health or safety and it is to someone we reasonably believe is able to prevent or lessen the threat.

**Specialized Government Functions.** We may disclose Protected Health Information for purposes related to military or national security concerns, such as for the purpose of a determination by the Department of Veterans Affairs of your eligibility for benefits.

**Inmates.** Under certain circumstances, we may disclose the Protected Health Information of inmates of a correctional institution.

**Workers’ Compensation.** Your Protected Health Information may be disclosed to comply with workers’ compensation laws and other similar programs.

**Other Restrictions on Uses and Disclosures of Protected Health Information**

The uses and disclosures of your Protected Health Information described above are permitted or required by federal law. Some states have laws that require additional privacy safeguards above and beyond the federal requirements. Thus, if a state law is more restrictive regarding uses and disclosures of your Protected Health Information or provides you with greater rights with respect to your Protected Health Information, Albertsons will comply with the state law. If your state has enacted a more stringent law, we have attached as an addendum to this Notice our privacy practices regarding your Protected Health Information in that state.

**Disclosures to Other Parties for Conducting Permitted Activities**

Albertsons may conduct the above-described activities ourselves, or we may use non-Albertsons entities to perform those operations. In those instances where we disclose your Protected Health Information to a third party acting on our behalf, we will protect your Protected Health Information through an appropriate privacy agreement.

**Other Uses and Disclosures of Protected Health Information Based Upon Your Written Authorization**

Other uses and disclosures of your Protected Health Information, not described above, will be made only with your written authorization. You may revoke this authorization at any time, in writing, except to the extent that we have taken action in reliance on the authorization.

**Your Rights**

As a patient, you have certain rights regarding your Protected Health Information.   We may ask that you submit a written request to exercise your patient rights.  These rights include:

**You have the right to request a restriction on certain uses and disclosures of your Protected Health Information.** This means that you may ask us not to use or disclose any part of your Protected Health Information for purposes of treatment, payment, or health care operations. You may also request that any part of your Protected Health Information not be disclosed to family members or friends who may be involved in your care. Your request must state the specific restriction requested and state to whom you want the restriction to apply.

Albertsons is not required to agree to such a restriction. If we do agree, we will abide by your restriction unless we need to use your Protected Health Information to provide emergency treatment. In addition, we may elect to terminate the restriction at any time.

**You have the right to request to receive information from us by an alternative means or at an alternative location if you believe it would enhance your privacy.** For example, you may request that we send written communications to an alternative address. We will attempt to accommodate all reasonable requests and will not request an explanation from you as to the basis for your request.

**You have the right to inspect and copy your Protected Health Information.** If you would like to see or copy your Protected Health Information, we are required to provide you access to your Protected Health Information for inspection and copying within 30 days after receipt of your request (60 days if the information is stored off-site). We may charge you a reasonable fee to cover duplicating costs. In addition, there may be situations where we may decide to deny your request for access. For example, we may deny your request if we believe the disclosure will endanger your life or health or that of another person. Depending on the circumstances of the denial, you may have a right to have this decision reviewed.

**You have the right to amend your Protected Health Information.** This means you may request an amendment of your Protected Health Information in our records for as long as we maintain this information. We will respond to your request within 60 days (with up to a 30-day extension, if needed). We may deny your request if, for example, we determine that your Protected Health Information is accurate and complete. If we deny your request, we will send you a written explanation and allow you to submit a written statement of disagreement.

**You have the right to receive an accounting of certain disclosures we have made of your Protected Health Information.** An accounting is a record of the disclosures that have been made of Protected Health Information. This right generally applies to non-routine disclosures, i.e., for purposes other than treatment, payment, or health care operations, as described in this Notice, made in the six-year period prior to your request (although you are free to request an accounting for a shorter period). We are required to provide the accounting within 60 days (with one 30-day extension, if needed) and to provide one accounting free of charge in any 12-month period.  (For more frequent requests, a reasonable fee may be charged.)

**You have the right to obtain a paper copy of this notice from Albertsons.**

**Complaints**

If you believe your privacy rights have been violated, you have the right to report such alleged violations to Albertsons, and we will promptly investigate the matter. You may file a complaint with Albertsons by contacting our Corporate Privacy Officer. Rest assured we will not retaliate against you in any way for filing a complaint about our privacy practices. You may also contact the Secretary of Health and Human Services.

You may contact our HIPAA Compliance/Legal Department at (208) 395-4455 or at P.O. Box 20, Boise, Idaho 83726 for further information about the complaint process or any other information covered by this Notice.

This notice is effective on April 14, 2003.
