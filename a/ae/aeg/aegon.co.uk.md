# Privacy | AEGON UK

## Privacy

The data controller for any personal information you give us is Scottish Equitable plc (now trading as AEGON).

This statement explains AEGON’s policy on data protection and privacy.

## Purpose of this website

This website is intended to provide a number of services to:

  * planholders
  * scheme members
  * employers
  * trustees, and
  * financial advisers



We’d only provide these services to those who they directly concern, and who have authorisation. We’d provide appropriate security accordingly.

The website also links to other AEGON services, which could include underwriting and valuations.

## Use of personal information

We’ll only use the information you give us for the following purposes:

  * dealing with your requests and enquiries
  * providing you with information about our products and services
  * carrying out customer and marketing research
  * internal record keeping
  * providing aggregate information and statistics for the purposes of monitoring website usage in order to help us develop our website and services (these statistics won’t include information that can be used to identify any individual)
  * recruitment and selection purposes
  * if you’re applying for a vacancy, then your email with any attachment will be sent to the recruitment mailbox and dealt with by the appropriate recruitment consultant



We don’t sell personal information collected through this website or use your personal data for any purposes other than those outlined above, unless you authorise it.

AEGON UK plc subsidiary companies (including Scottish Equitable plc) may send you marketing information. If you don’t want to receive this, please write to the Direct Marketing Department, AEGON Lochside Crescent, Edinburgh Park, Edinburgh, EH12 9SE.

Where necessary, we’ll process ‘sensitive data’ (including any medical information) in accordance with the Data Protection Act 1998 (the Act). This could include information about your:

  * physical health or condition
  * mental health or condition
  * sexual life



If we collect medical data, we may use it to assess any claims you make under the plan, and we’ll hold it for as long as we're required to. We may pass it to reassurers, private investigators, medical professionals and/or healthcare management companies (which would be used to arrange medicals).

We have policies in place, which means that we hold all personal data securely and limit access to those who need to see it. We apply extra security to sensitive personal data, such as medical details.

We’re legally obliged to make information available to regulatory bodies or authorities such as the Financial Services Authority or HM Revenue & Customs. We may also have to disclose information to comply with money laundering laws and for other purposes, for example detecting crime.

We’ll also share permitted relevant information with anyone acting on your behalf (for example a financial adviser) so they can fully carry out their role as agent.

## Use of personal information accessed by an organisation

We can receive individual planholders' and/or scheme members’ personal information from, and provide it to, employers, trustees and financial advisers, as long as we have the appropriate authority. For example, they can:

  * request statement of benefits
  * update our records as part of a monthly or yearly renewal of a scheme
  * change their members’ personal information
  * get valuations of policy or membership benefits



## How AEGON treats your personal data

We fully support and follow the principles of Data Protection, as set out in the Act. We make sure that our staff – and those acting on our behalf – obtain, use and disclose personal data lawfully and correctly. We don’t believe we can operate successfully otherwise. It’s also important in making sure everyone we deal with has confidence in us. This policy operates in all of our offices – both in the UK and overseas.

Specifically, the principles require that personal information will:

  * be processed fairly and lawfully and, in particular, won’t be processed unless specific conditions are met
  * be obtained only for one or more specified and lawful purposes, and won’t be further processed in any manner incompatible with that purpose or those purposes
  * be adequate, relevant and not excessive in relation to the purpose or purposes for which it’s processed
  * be accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date
  * not be kept for longer than is necessary for that purpose or those purposes
  * be processed in accordance with the rights of the individual under the Act
  * have in place appropriate technical and organisational measures against unauthorised or unlawful processing of personal data and against accidental loss or destruction of, or damage to, personal data
  * not be transferred to a country or territory outside the European Economic Area (EEA) (the countries of the European Union plus Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland) unless that country or territory ensures an adequate level of protection for the rights and freedoms of data subjects in relation to the processing of personal data or unless specific agreement has been sought from the individuals concerned



By using appropriate and consistent management and controls, we’ll:

  * meet our legal obligations to specify what we’re using the personal information for in the Scottish Equitable plc Data Protection Notification particulars, which you can find on the Information Commissioner’s website at [http://www.ico.gov.uk](http://www.ico.gov.uk/)
  * only collect and process information to the extent that we need it to operate or to comply with a legal requirement
  * make sure the information is accurate and of high quality
  * apply checks to determine how long the information is held for
  * make sure that the people we hold information on can fully exercise their rights under the Act
  * safeguard personal information by taking appropriate technical and organisational security measures
  * make sure that personal data isn’t transferred outside the EEA without suitable safeguards or agreement from the individual



## Your rights under the Data Protection Act

You have a number of rights under the Data Protection Act, including:

  * the right to get copies of all the personal data that we hold on you, with only a few exceptions, and
  * the right not to receive direct marketing



If you want a copy of your personal data, please write to Data Protection Officer, AEGON, Lochside Crescent, Edinburgh Park, Edinburgh, EH12 9SE, enclosing your details, a description of the information you want and a cheque for £10, made payable to AEGON UK.

## Cookies

A cookie is a piece of data stored on a user's hard drive containing information about the user. They work by setting data on the visitor’s browser to anonymously track the pages they visit on a website. We also use action tags (sometimes called web beacons).

We currently use cookies/tags on our websites to:

  * anonymously track participation in online surveys accessed on or from the AEGON website. We’ll set a cookie so that we remember whether you want to take part in a survey so we don’t have to ask every time you visit the site. We won’t store or collect any personal data.
  * anonymously track the usage of the website, either by AEGON or its appointed third party. We also use a third-party company to place adverts on the web, which link to the AEGON website. When someone clicks on one of these adverts and arrives at the AEGON website, we’ll anonymously track which pages they visit. This helps us to develop our site and online advertising and improve user experience.
  * anonymously track visitors’ usage of the AEGON website. When someone visits the site, we’ll track which pages they access so we can understand which pages are used most and use this knowledge to develop our site and improve user experience.



AEGON, and/or the third party, may use non-personal information about your visits to the website, for example date/time of visit, the cookie and the first three octets of the IP address. Neither AEGON nor the third party collects personally identifying information (PII).

You can find more information about cookies, including how to block them and/or delete them, at <http://www.aboutcookies.org/>

## Third-party use of information

You do have the option to transfer to websites that have links on our sites. If you choose to use one of these links, you may be asked for separate login IDs and passwords for these services. We won’t hold on to any information to do with that transfer.

## Security

We currently operate our security requirements through our security policy:

  * Breaches in security are dealt with by the security policy.
  * All members of staff, including temporary members of staff, sign confidentiality agreements to make sure they treat the information with respect.
  * Staff can only access the systems that they need to do their job.
  * We make sure that personal information is only passed to those people and organisations that are entitled to know. We check to confirm that people are who they say they are, and that these organisations or people are allowed to have access to this information. Every business area has its own verification checks that relate to the data held and types of people who may need access.
  * We train all our staff in data protection every two years. This makes sure that members of staff know how to treat personal information and the risks involved if it’s poorly treated.



We’ve put security policies, rules and technical measures in place to protect the personal data that we have under our control from:

  * unauthorised access
  * improper use or disclosure
  * unauthorised modification
  * unlawful destruction or accidental loss



All our employees and data processors who have access to, and are associated with, handling our visitors' personal data are obliged to respect its confidentiality.
