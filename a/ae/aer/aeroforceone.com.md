A cookie is a piece of data stored on the visitor’s hard drive containing information about the user. Once the user closes his/her browser, the cookie simply terminates. At Aero Force One, cookies are used to improve your online experiences by providing content specific to your interests (e.g., to store your password to eliminate the need for multiple log-in information or to recognize you by name). The use of cookies is an industry standard that is found on most major websites.

**Security**  
Aero Force One has taken steps to make all information received from our online visitors as secure as possible against unauthorized access and use. All information related to this website is protected through proper security measures, which are periodically reviewed.   
Privacy Statement for Children Under the Age of 13  
The activities of this site are carried out in compliance with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998. Under this Act, we may not ask a child to provide more personal information than is reasonably necessary to participate in the free Aero Force One website.   
On certain occasions, Aero Force One may offer sweepstakes promotions and/or contests. Children under the age of 13 will be asked to check a box indicating he/she is under the age of 13. If so, he/she will be asked to submit his/her parent’s email address. After retrieving such information, Aero Force One will send an email to the parent notifying him/her the child has registered and provide him/her with information about the program and give instructions on how the parent can remove the child from the promotion and/or contest. Aero Force One will use the collected information (emails) ONLY to notify the promotion and/or contest winners and their parent that they have won. Aero Force One requires the winners’ parents to provide us with all information other than as needed for legal requirements in connection with the promotion and/or contest. At Aero Force One, we will ONLY collect the child’s email as well as the parent’s email for promotional or contest purposes and in no event will Aero Force One use the information for any other purposes than to award prizes. The child will not be able to enter any sweepstakes or contest if he/she does not submit his/her parent’s email address.   
When we receive a request to purchase a membership or merchandise from a child under the age of 13, which would require our collection of personally identifiable information, an email requesting the consent of the parent along with instructions on purchasing the membership online or via telephone or mail is sent to the parent. The parent must fill out the personally identifiable information needed including the parent’s credit card number to consent to the child’s purchase and participation in the Aerosmith Fan Club.

**Message Board Policy**  
Participants must have a paid annual membership, which requires parental consent for a child under the age of 13, to join the Aero Force One Fan Club and participate on the Aero Force One Message Boards. It’s recommended that visitors never give out their full name, home address, email address, telephone number, or any other personally identifiable information that would allow any other online user to contact you either online or offline.   
The information, ideas or opinions posted through this website do not necessarily reflect the views of US. WE shall not assume responsibility or liability for any postings or for any claims, damages or losses resulting from their use or appearance on this website. WE will sweep its message boards periodically at its discretion.   
WE do not allow postings that contain: (1) profanity or obscenities; (2) private or personal information that identifies a user or another person; (3) slanderous, defamatory, threatening and harassing comments; and (4) other information that Aero Force One believes is inappropriate.   
This message board may only be used for noncommercial purposes. Users may not post any information intended to promote or generate revenue for themselves or other third-party businesses. WE remains committed toward providing our users with the best service available and will maintain reasonable procedures to protect our message boards. WE reserves the right to edit, delete or refuse to post any messages that violate its policies and does not endorse the accuracy or reliability of the content posted by its users.

Again, Aero Force One encourages participants not to post personally identifiable information on the Message Boards and retains rights to remove any personally identifiable information that may be posted.
