Some of the products and services on our site are offered without collecting any personally identifiable information from you. You may surf most of this site and its content anonymously without giving out any personally identifiable information. Aero Force One only collects personal information from our visitors on a voluntary basis. WE don't require any personally identifiable information to obtain access to the area of the site that is free to the public, and only collect personally identifiable information such as first and last name, mailing address, email address, telephone number, gender and date of birth when visitors register to join Aero Force One members only section of the site or to receive promotional information from US or enter a featured sweepstakes or contest where such information is required. 

Personally identifiable information is collected from our members and is used to fulfill requested transactions (such as purchasing an annual membership or shipping merchandise) and to provide special offers and services through newsletters, mailings, emails and telephone calls by US. Personally identifiable information is only collected from children under 13 years of age with verifiable parental or guardian consent for the purposes defined below. If you purchase an Aerosmith Fan Club annual membership or merchandise and services, WE may also collect a credit cardholder name, cardholder address and card number, street and billing address of any purchaser. 

**The Collection of Limited Personally Identifiable Information  
**Information provided at the Aero Force One website may be shared with Aerosmith and Rag Doll Merchandise, Inc., their management, representatives, and any existing or new record label they may join. WE are not responsible for how Third Parties handle the data once they receive it.

At Aero Force One, cookies are used to improve your online experiences by providing content specific to your interests (e.g., to store your password to eliminate the need for multiple log-in information or to recognize you by name). The use of cookies is an industry standard that is found on most major websites.

Privacy Statement for Children Under the Age of 13.

The activities of this site are carried out in compliance with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998. Under this Act, we may not ask a child to provide more personal information than is reasonably necessary to participate in the free Aero Force One website.   
On certain occasions, Aero Force One may offer sweepstakes promotions and/or contests. Children under the age of 13 will be asked to check a box indicating he/she is under the age of 13. If so, he/she will be asked to submit his/her parent’s email address. After retrieving such information, Aero Force One will send an email to the parent notifying him/her the child has registered and provide him/her with information about the program and give instructions on how the parent can remove the child from the promotion and/or contest. Aero Force One will use the collected information (emails) ONLY to notify the promotion and/or contest winners and their parent that they have won. Aero Force One requires the winners’ parents to provide us with all information other than as needed for legal requirements in connection with the promotion and/or contest. At Aero Force One, we will ONLY collect the child’s email as well as the parent’s email for promotional or contest purposes and in no event will Aero Force One use the information for any other purposes than to award prizes. The child will not be able to enter any sweepstakes or contest if he/she does not submit his/her parent’s email address. 

When we receive a request to purchase a membership or merchandise from a child under the age of 13, which would require our collection of personally identifiable information, an email requesting the consent of the parent along with instructions on purchasing the membership online or via telephone or mail is sent to the parent. The parent must fill out the personally identifiable information needed including the parent’s credit card number to consent to the child’s purchase and participation in the Aerosmith Fan Club.
