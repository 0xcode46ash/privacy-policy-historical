**  
Information We Share with Others**

**Aerosoles:** We share the information we collect internally to continually evolve and refine the products and services we offer.

**Service Providers:** We provide information to other companies, including banks and companies that process credit cards and checks, to secure the financial transactions necessary to process orders, exchanges, returns, refunds and credits. 

**Third-Party Offers:** Occasionally, we provide your physical mailing address information to responsible outside companies we carefully select so they can let you know about those of their products or services we think might be of interest to you. If you would prefer not to receive offers from outside companies please write to us at Aerosoles Direct Division, PO Box 1916, Edison, NJ 08818-1916 or call us at 800-798-9478.

**Others:** On rare occasions, we may be required to disclose customer information pursuant to lawful requests, such as subpoenas or court orders, or in compliance with applicable laws. Also, if the ownership of all or a part of a business within the Aerosoles were to change, customer information pertinent to that business’s operations would likely be transferred to, or licensed for use by, the new owner.

NOT share information about you with any of the companies outside the Aerosoles family or service providers necessary to process your order that we have authorized to send you promotional information about their products or services;

**Safeguarding the Information We Collect**
