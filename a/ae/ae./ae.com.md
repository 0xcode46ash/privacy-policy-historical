At American Eagle Outfitters, we feel that the best way to protect our customers on the Internet - is to inform them about what we are doing on the Internet. So in this section, we've tried to answer a few of your questions and concerns as honestly as we can. If we missed a direct concern of yours - or if you just want to talk to us, feel free to give us a call @ (888) A-EAGLE5. Or drop us an e-mail @ [custserv@ae.com](mailto:custserv@ae.com). So please take the time to read our privacy policy - and thanks for browsing! 

**What's the difference between Security and Privacy?**

> Security involves making sure that any sensitive information you may provide to us is handled in a safe and secure manner.

> Privacy refers to information we gather about you, and what we do with that information once we have it. 

**When I visit ae.com, what information is gathered about me?**

> There is a limited amount of information any website can know about its visitors without explicitly asking them questions. Generally this involves filling out forms so you can, for example, join our mailing list, apply for a credit card, or enter a contest at ae.com. 

> When you enter a contest we ask you for your: Name, address, telephone number, and e-mail address. When you apply for an AE Credit Card we ask you for: Name, address, telephone number, and e-mail address, etc...

> If you fill out one of our forms - your information is placed in our "House File". Our House File is a large database of American Eagle Outfitters customers. We do not trade names with other companies. The only third party company that receive individual information is GE Capital, who handles all of our on-line Credit Card Applications. GE Capital does not receive your information unless you apply for the credit card. 

> If you join our mailing list, you will receive e-mail and information in the mail, that alerts you to sales and special promotions that we may be running on the Internet or in our stores. American Eagle Outfitters will not solicit you over the phone. If you would not like to have us contact you via e-mail, simply mark the check box on the registration form marked "not in the mood for e-mail." Or give us a call at (888) A-EAGLE5 and one of our friendly operators will help you. 

**What happens when I submit an e-mail to AE?**

> We read every message that comes to us. We also try to respond back within at least 24 hours of its receipt. 
> 
> We keep e-mail addresses on file for documentation purposes and to make sure that we respond appropriately to you. 
> 
> We do not sell or give out e-mail addresses to other companies. 
> 
> We think we have addressed several of the major issues. But if you have any specific questions, please feel free to contact us either by phone or by e-mail - [custserv@ae.com](mailto:custserv@ae.com)
