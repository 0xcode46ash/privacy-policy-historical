Note, when applying for an AEO Credit Card, issued by Synchrony Bank, additional privacy policies may apply to information collected during such process.

1\. INFORMATION COLLECTED.

 **Information Provided.**

We receive and may keep information voluntarily provided when you navigate our Platforms, make a purchase, utilize our services, apply for an AEO Credit Card, create/maintain an AEO account, register with or otherwise contact us, take part in a special promotion, customer research, contest or sweepstakes, or otherwise provide or submit information.As part of such information collected, we or our Vendors (as defined below) may collect "Personal Information" (information that may be used to identify you as an individual) such as your name, e-mail address, telephone number, home address, payment information (e.g., account information or credit card number), or social security number (e.g., if you are applying for an AEO credit card, issued by Synchrony Bank). The types of Personal Information collected may vary depending on your navigation and use of the Platforms. For example, we will collect your credit card number and other payment related information in connection with your purchase of products and/or services through the Platforms.

We may also receive and keep information you provide to us regarding other people. For example, you may provide us with the name and address for a gift recipient. When you provide us with the Personal Information about the intended recipient of a shipment, we use that information for the purposes of processing the shipment and, in some cases, to communicate with the intended recipient. We rely on you to obtain the intended recipient's consent to our use of their Personal Information for these limited purposes.

 **Information We Receive from Third Parties.**

In our efforts to maintain accurate and complete information, we utilize third party entities to assist us with updating and maintaining current contact information (e.g., National Change of Address or NCOA).We may also receive Personal Information and other information from sources assisting us with updating, improving and/or analyzing our records or with detecting fraud or theft.Additionally, we may receive information from various consumer reporting agencies and related service providers.

Also, we may receive information about you from other third parties. For example, if you are on another website and you opt-in to receive information from AEO, that website will submit to us your e-mail address and other information about you so that we may contact you as requested. You may also choose to participate in a third party application or feature (such as one of our Facebook or Twitter applications or a similar application or feature on a third party website) through which you allow us to collect (or the third party to share) information about you, including Usage Information (as defined herein) and Personal Information such as lists of your friends, "likes", comments you have shared, groups and location. Services like Facebook Connect give you the option to post information about your activities on our Platforms to your profile page to share with others within your network. In addition, we may receive information about you if other users of a third party website give us access to their profiles and you are one of their "connections", or if information about you is otherwise accessible through your "connections" web page, profile page, or similar page on a social networking or other third party website or interactive service.

Information Collected Automatically.

 _Usage Information._ Whenever you visit or interact with the Platforms, we, as well as third-party advertisers, vendors and/or service providers (collectively, "Vendors"), may use a variety of technologies that automatically or passively collect information ("Automated Technologies") about how the Platforms are navigated, accessed and used ("Usage Information"). Usage Information may include browser type, device type and characteristics, Device Identifiers (as defined below), operating system, application version, the pages served, the time/date, your geo-location, the preceding page views, and your use of and pathway through the Platforms. This information helps us administer our Platforms, keep our Platforms fresh and interesting, recognize you and your Device, personalize and tailor content, diagnose problems with our servers, analyze trends, gather broad demographic information for business or aggregate use, and enable our online presence to operate properly and efficiently for you and for your individual customer experience.

 _Device Identifier._ We or our Vendors may automatically collect your IP address or other unique identifier ("Device Identifier") for the "Device" (e.g., computer, mobile phone, tablet or other device) you use to access the Platforms. A Device Identifier is usually a number that is assigned to your Device when you access a Platform or its servers, permitting identification of your Device by its Device Identifier.

 _Automated Technologies._ The Automated Technologies used on the Platforms to collect Usage Information include, but are not limited to, _cookies_ (data files placed on a Device when it is used to visit the Platforms), _mobile analytics software_ , _pixel tags_ (transparent graphic image, sometimes called a web beacon or tracking beacon, placed on a Platform to indicate that a page or e-mail has been viewed), and _similar technologies_. Both **session cookies** (which expire once you close your web browser) and **persistent cookies** (which remain on your Device, sometimes until you delete them) may be used. Please remember, some Automated Technologies may tell your browser to get content from another server.

If you would prefer not to accept cookies, most browsers will allow you to: (i) change your Device browser settings to notify you when your Device receives a cookie, which lets you choose whether or not to accept it; or (ii) set your Device browser to automatically reject any cookie. However, please be aware that if you disable or reject cookies, some features and services on our Platforms may not work properly because we may not be able to recognize and associate you with your AEO account. Please note, even if you choose to restrict or modify your settings, you may still see or receive AEO advertisements via our Platforms and on other sites, but such advertisements will not be based upon your browsing history.

AEO does not respond to "do-not-track" setting in user's web browser, and our Platforms may continue to collect information in the manner described in this Notice. You can also learn more about cookies by visiting [allaboutcookies.org](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/) which includes additional useful information on cookies and how to block cookies using different types of browsers.

2\. USE OF THE INFORMATION COLLECTED.

We or our Vendors may place Automated Technologies on your Device for a variety of reasons, including security purposes (including protecting the integrity of the Platforms and our stores), Platform navigation, and marketing and analytics purposes (including allowing the selection of personalized ads or offers believed to appeal to you, based on your interests, preferences, location, or demographic information). Additionally, Automated Technologies may also be used to associate you with social networking sites (e.g., Facebook and Twitter), and, if you so choose, enable interaction between your activities on the Platforms and your activities on such social networking sites.

The information collected via the Platforms is used to provide you service and answer your questions and requests; maintain our loyalty programs; provide you with access to certain areas and features of the Platforms; verify your identity; deliver merchandise and services ; conduct research, analysis, and surveys; communicate with you about your account and activities on the Platforms; tailor content, advertisements, and offers served to you; alert you to products (including recalls); serve you our promotional information and that of our partners, we think may be of interest to you; improve the Platforms; comply with license and legal obligations; and for purposes disclosed at the time you provide your Personal Information or otherwise with your consent.

Synchrony Bank may have its own policies that govern the site when you apply for a credit card.

 **Your Agreement to Have Your Personal Information Shared.** While utilizing our Platforms, you may have the opportunity to opt-in to receive information and/or marketing offers from someone else or to otherwise consent to the sharing of your information with a third party, including social networking sites such as Facebook or Twitter.

 **Business Transfers.** We may share your Personal Information with other entities and our affiliates primarily for business and operational purposes. In the event that AEO is involved in a bankruptcy, merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of assets, your information may be sold or transferred as part of that transaction.

If we determine upon collection that a user is under this age, we will not use or maintain his/her Personal Information without the parent/guardian's consent. If we become aware that we have unknowingly collected Personal Information from a child under the age of 13, we will make reasonable efforts to delete such information from our records.
