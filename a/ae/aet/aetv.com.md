Last updated on April 21, 2000

**A &E Television Networks ("AETN")**  
Our postal address is:  
235 East 45th Street  
New York, NY 10017

We can be reached via email at [feedback@AandE.com](mailto:feedback@AandE.com). You can also reach us by telephone at (212) 210-1400. 

AETN supports a general policy of openness about personal data collection and use. We have adopted and implemented this Privacy Policy as part of our commitment to protecting your personal information from misuse. 

This Privacy Policy applies to our information-gathering and dissemination practices for the following sites: [www.aande.com](http://www.aande.com/); [www.historychannel.com](http://www.historychannel.com/); [www.biography.com](http://www.biography.com/); [www.mysteries.com](http://www.mysteries.com/); [www.historytravel.com](http://www.historytravel.com/); [www.historyinternational.com](http://www.historyinternational.com/); [www.veterans.com](http://www.veterans.com/); [www.pythonshop.com](http://www.pythonshop.com/); and [www.originalavengers.com](http://www.originalavengers.com/).

**What information does AETN collect on its Web sites?**  
AETN collects both personal information and aggregated information on its Web sites. We discuss our collection of different kinds of information below.

**Personal Information**  
You do not have to provide personal information to use any of our Web sites. We collect personal information only when you provide it to us — for example, in answering surveys; entering contests and sweepstakes; registering to receive electronic newsletters, television listings and other materials; participating in message boards, book clubs and quizzes; purchasing items from our stores; and taking part in other promotional opportunities. You may be asked to provide your contact information (such as your name, postal address, telephone numbers and/or email address), financial information (such as credit card numbers), and demographic information (such as your Zip code, age, or income level). 

Contact information is used to respond to your inquiries; to notify you if you have won a contest or a quiz and to send products and services ordered from our sites. You also may receive periodic mailings from us with information on new products and services, updates to our Web sites or upcoming events. Occasionally, we also share our customer mailing list with reputable and carefully screened firms for marketing or promotional purposes. You may opt out of having your contact information as part of our mailing list at any time (see the Choice/Opt-Out Section below). 

Financial information that is collected is used only to process orders for products and services purchased through our Web sites and is never shared with third parties for any other reason. 

Demographic information is shared with advertisers and third parties only on an aggregated basis. (See the Aggregated Information Section below.)

You may be asked to provide military background information (branch of service, unit, rank, hometown during years of service, medals/honors and wars in which you fought); and other information (occupation, hobbies, short biography, your homepage) in creating a user profile in our public forums. If you choose to provide this information, it will be accessible to other users of the Web site (See Public Forums Section below).

Whenever we request your personal information on our Web sites, we will try to explain to you how we intend to use it and provide you with a choice to decline certain uses. In addition, if we plan to post any of your personal information on our Web sites (for example, your name and home town to identify you as the winner of a quiz), we will also notify you of this possibility either when you provide information to us or prior to posting the information.

We may be required to disclose personal information pursuant to valid legal process.

**Aggregated Information**  
We collect information through our Web sites relating to traffic levels on our Web sites — for example, the total number of users visiting particular pages. We also aggregate demographic information and the results of surveys. 

We use IP addresses to calculate Web site usage levels. Whenever you are on the Internet, a number (an IP address) is automatically assigned to your computer. This number is identified and logged automatically whenever you visit our Web sites. Collecting IP addresses is standard practice on the Internet, and is done automatically by many Web sites. An IP address does not provide us with any of your personally identifiable information, so although your session will be logged, you will remain anonymous to us.

This aggregated information, which does not personally identify you, is helpful to us for improving the services we offer and for marketing purposes. We may share aggregated information with our advertisers, business partners, or other companies.

**Use of Cookies by AETN**  
Cookies are data that a Web site transfers to an individual's computer for record-keeping purposes. Cookies, which are an industry standard used by most Web sites, including ours, can facilitate a user's ongoing access to and use of a site. Cookies do not cause damage to your computer systems or files.

We use a temporary cookie to track the products you have chosen to purchase while shopping on our Web sites. The cookie expires once you are done shopping. The cookie saves you the trouble of entering information over and over again during a single visit. We also use cookies in our discussion areas to eliminate the need to log in every time you use the book clubs and other message boards on our Web sites. 

If you do not want information collected through the use of cookies, there is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows you to decline or accept the cookie feature. You should note, however, that declining the cookies may make it difficult for you to make purchases on our Web sites and will make entering our discussion areas more cumbersome.

**Public Forums**  
We make discussion areas, message boards, and/or book clubs available to our users. Please remember that any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information, and you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal information. 

To register for the public forums, you will need to select a screen name and provide your email address. A password is required to log into the pubic forums. Depending on the site, you will either select your own password at the time of registration or will receive an email notification from us with a randomly generated initial password.

Whenever you contribute to a public forum, your screen name will automatically appear with your post and link to your profile. When you log into the discussion forums, you will be able to set up your profile, which you may edit at any time. You have the ability to change your password within the profile. Your password will never be visible to other users as part of your profile. Providing information as part of the profile is entirely optional. 

If you have indicated as part of your profile that you would like to accept private messages, other users will be able to communicate with you by sending you "private messages," without actual knowledge of your email address.

On [www.veterans.com](http://www.veterans.com/): Information that you provide as part of your user profile, except your password, will be accessible to other users of the site by clicking on your screen name associated with any of your postings. You may choose to limit disclosure of such information (including your name, email address and geographic location) to other users of the site if you indicate in the profile that you would like to keep such information private. Any remaining information contained in the profile, except your password, will be accessible. In addition, any information you have provided as part of your profile on [www.veterans.com](http://www.veterans.com/), including military information, will be accessible to users in the Veteran Locator.

_On all other AETN Web sites with public forums_ : Information that you provide as part of your user profile, except your password and email address, will be accessible to other users of the site by clicking on your screen name associated with any of your postings. However, you may opt to display your email address with your posts.

**Children**  
Our Web sites are general audience sites. We do not direct any of our content specifically at children under thirteen (13) years of age. We run classroom sites as educational tools for teachers, where contests encouraging submissions of children’s essays are occasionally announced. We announce and post personal information (such as name and home town) of contest winners after receiving consent from the children’s parents. We will not collect information from children under the age of 13 without first gaining consent or giving direct notification to a parent or guardian. We will not use this information to contact the child for other purposes, distribute this information to third parties, or give the child the ability to post publicly or otherwise distribute personally identifiable information without a parent’s or guardian’s consent. 

**Third-Party Ad Serving**  
We currently contract with DoubleClick to sell and manage the advertisements that you see on the site. The use of advertising cookies sent by third-party servers is standard in the Internet industry, and DoubleClick or our advertisers may assign their own cookies to your browser. Through cookie technology, DoubleClick and/or other advertisers may collect certain non-personally identifiable information about you. This information may be used to deliver tailored ads to you. We do not control this process, and these cookies are subject to DoubleClick's and/or other advertisers' policies. However, DoubleClick does not obtain, through use of cookies or otherwise, any personally identifiable information from us or from any of our Web sites. Click here to opt out of DoubleClick's cookies [http://www.doubleclick.com:8080/privacy_policy/privacy.htm.](http://www.doubleclick.com:8080/privacy_policy/privacy.htm)

DoubleClick makes available both its policies and information practices at DoubleClick <http://www.doubleclick.net/>, and DoubleClick has informed us that it has voluntarily opened its practices and systems for third party auditing. Click here <http://www.doubleclick.net/nf/general/onpriset.htm> at DoubleClick's Privacy Policy to read their privacy statement or email them at [info@doubleclick.net](mailto:info@doubleclick.net) if you have any additional questions. 

**Security**  
We have security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. Any time we ask for a credit card number we transmit that credit card number in an encrypted format. We use industry-standard, SSL (secure socket layer) encryption. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or from our online products or services, and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission, we make our best effort to ensure its security on our systems. We may use third parties to host and maintain our Web sites.

**Links to Third Party Sites**  
Our Web sites may contain links to third-party Web sites. The linked sites are not under the control of AETN, and we are not responsible for the contents of any linked site or any link contained in a linked site. We are providing these links only as a convenience, and the inclusion of a link does not imply endorsement of the linked site by AETN.
