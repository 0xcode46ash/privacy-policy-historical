Collecting and Using Personal Information |  | 

Welcome to Aetna Inc.’s websites. We appreciate your interest in us. When you visit and navigate our sites and when you communicate with us via our sites, we will not collect personal information about you, unless you provide us that information voluntarily. If you provide personal information to us voluntarily via our websites, we will not sell, license or transmit that information outside of Aetna Inc. and those affiliated companies involved in administering or providing services for our health benefits plans and financial products, unless required to do so by legal, judicial or governmental proceedings, or unless we do so in accordance with an express authorization you have given us. Also, in some cases, we may disclose information to our contractors or agents for the purpose of enabling them to perform certain functions for us. We will disclose information in compliance with applicable laws and regulations and will require the recipient to protect the information and use it only for the purpose provided.

By “personal information,” we mean data that is unique to an individual, such as a name, address, social security number, or telephone number. From time to time, we may request personal information from you at our sites in order to deliver requested materials to you, respond to your questions, or deliver a product or service.

Your E-Mail |  | 

We welcome your comments or questions about our websites and have provided e-mail boxes for that purpose. We will share your comments and questions with our customer service representatives and those employees most capable of addressing your questions and concerns. 

Please note that your e-mail, like most, if not all, non-encrypted Internet e-mail communications, may be accessed and viewed by other Internet users, without your knowledge and permission, while in transit to us. For that reason, to protect your privacy, please do not use e-mail to communicate information to us that you consider confidential. If you wish, you may contact us instead via telephone at the numbers provided at various locations on our sites or, in the case of our health plan members, at the Member Services toll free number that appears on your identification card. 

There are some locations on Aetna Inc.’s websites where we have made special provisions for a more secure environment in which we can exchange information with you. At each of these locations, we will provide you with appropriate instructions.   
  
Other Information; "Cookies" |  | 

You should also be aware that when you visit our websites, we collect certain information that does not identify you personally, but provides us with “usage data,” such as the number of visitors we receive or what pages are visited most often. This data helps us to analyze and improve the usefulness of the information we provide at these websites. 

Like most commercial website owners, we may also use what is known as “cookie” technology. A “cookie” is an element of data that a website can send to your browser when you link to that website. It is not a computer program and has no ability to read data residing on your computer or instruct it to perform any step or function. By assigning a unique data element to each visitor, the website is able to recognize repeat users, track usage patterns and better serve you when you return to that site. The cookie does not extract other personal information about you, such as your name or address. Most browsers provide a simple procedure that will enable you to control whether you want to receive cookies by notifying you when a website is about to deposit a cookie file.   
  
Linking to Other Sites |  | 

From time to time, Aetna Inc. websites may provide links to other websites, not owned or controlled by Aetna Inc., that we think might be useful or of interest to you. We cannot, however, be responsible for the privacy practices used by other website owners or the content or accuracy of those other websites. Links to various non-Aetna Inc. websites do not constitute or imply endorsement by Aetna Inc. of these websites, any products or services described on these sites, or of any other material contained in them.   
  
Changes to This Statement. |  | 

Aetna Inc. may change this Statement from time to time without notice. This Statement is not intended to and does not create any contractual or other legal rights in or on behalf of any party.
