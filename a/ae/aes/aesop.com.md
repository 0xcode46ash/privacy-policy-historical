> Your use of ExactSeek/Aesop's services constitutes a business relationship wherein we provide a promotion service for your web site(s). In exchange, ExactSeek/Aesop reserves the right to use the contact information collected during site submission to deliver notices regarding changes or updates to our service, to provide free newsletters (SiteProNews, SEO-News and The MarkJoyner.name Announcement List), to inform you of additions to the Jayde Online Network of web sites, or to send announcements and carefully screened offers and information on behalf of our partners or advertisers. 
> 
> You may remove yourself from any or all of our notice and announcement mailings at anytime using the unsubscribe methods provided in those mailings. Any mailing received from our company is clearly identified and includes a valid email address and unsubscribe link which you can use to remove yourself from future mailings.
