At The American Kennel Club, we are committed to protecting your privacy. We use the information we collect about you to process orders and to provide a more personalized browsing and shopping experience. 

When you create an account with us, we need to know your name, e-mail address, and mailing address. This lets us notify you of your order status and helps make your shopping experience more enjoyable. We need to know your credit card number and expiration date when you order products or reports so that we may process and fulfill your request. When you place orders or access your account information, we use a secure server. The secure server software (SSL) encrypts all information you input before it is sent to us. Furthermore, all of the customer data we collect is protected against unauthorized access.
