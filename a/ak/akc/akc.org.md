[](https://web.archive.org/store/account/) **Web Site Privacy Policy**

At The American Kennel Club, we are committed to protecting your privacy. We use the information we collect about you on this web site to process your orders or information requests and to provide a more personalized experience while you are browsing. 

**Cookies**  
A "cookie" is a small data file stored on your computer. At AKC we place a unique identifier in the cookie and use the cookie to connect your computer with the information we store for you in our database. Some examples of the data we store in our database include your account preferences, items added to your shopping cart, previous inquiries about dogs on our site, and preferences you indicate as part of "My AKC". Through cookies we may alert you to new areas that we think might be of interest to you when you return to our site, record past activity at our site or customize web page content. 

Your information is stored in a safe and secure database. Our cookies do not contain any personally identifying or financial information, but they do enable us to personalize and enhance your browsing and shopping experiences with us.

Your name, e-mail address, and mailing address let us notify you of your order status and help make your shopping experience more enjoyable. We need to know your credit card number and expiration date when you order merchandise or reports so that we may process and fulfill your request. 

When you place orders or access your account information, we use a secure server. The secure server software (SSL) encrypts all information you input before it is sent to us. Furthermore, all of the customer data we collect is protected against unauthorized access.
