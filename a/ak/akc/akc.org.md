**Your Privacy**

At The American Kennel Club, we are committed to protecting your privacy. We use the information we collect about you to process orders and to provide a more personalized shopping experience. Please read on for more details about our privacy policy. 

**What information do we collect? How do we use it?**

When you register with us, we need to know your name, e-mail address, and mailing address. This lets us notify you of your order status and helps make your shopping experience more enjoyable. When you order, we need to know your credit card number, and expiration date. This allows us to process and fulfill your order. 

We may also use the information we collect to occasionally notify you about important functionality changes to the Web site, new AKC services, and special offers we think you'll find valuable. If you would rather not receive this information, visit the Customer Account Management page to change your preferences.

Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually change your browser to prevent that. Even without a cookie, you can still use most of the features in our store, including placing items in your shopping cart and purchasing them. 

**Will the AKC disclose the information it collects to outside parties?**

The AKC currently does not sell, trade, or rent your personal information collected on our web site to others. We may choose to do so in the future with trustworthy third parties, but you can tell us not to by updating your account preferences accordingly.
