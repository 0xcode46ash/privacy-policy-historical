# Arizona @ Your Service Privacy Policy

Thank you for visiting Arizona @ Your Service™ and reviewing our Privacy Policy statement. Arizona @ Your Service™ provides a convenient "Front Door" to various information and services available from the State of Arizona by linking you to various other web sites. Though this web portal does not request information from you directly, individual web sites you access through the portal may request specific information from you.  This statement is included to inform you solely about the information that could be collected online as a result of visiting Arizona @ Your Service™ itself, and 

_not_

as a result of following a link from Arizona @ Your Service™ to reach a State agency's website or online service.  All individual agency web sites of the State of Arizona are required to contain a Privacy Policy Statement that describes what information is obtained online, how the agency uses that information, and what steps are being taken to ensure the security of customer data. Your rights to privacy are of utmost importance to the State of Arizona in building trust and confidence when conducting business through the Internet. 

Arizona @ Your Service™ offers many of the services online that you might otherwise transact in person.  Our goal is to provide citizens with a more convenient and efficient means in which to interact with the Arizona government.  If at any time you choose not to proceed with a transaction offered through the Arizona @ Your Service™ Portal, your choice will in no way affect your ability to receive benefits or services.  If you prefer to apply for benefits or services in person, you may do so at the respective State agency providing such benefits and/or services. 

_Information Collected and Stored Automatically_

Arizona @ Your Service™ does not use "cookies" to gather information during your visit. Individual web sites you access through the portal may use "cookies", however, and are required to define their use in the separate privacy policy statement located on the specific site. The web server that hosts Arizona @ Your Service™ does gather certain information about the visit automatically in a standard log file. This information never identifies you personally and consists of only the following items:

  1. The Internet domain (for example, "xcompany.com" if you use a private Internet access account, or "yourschool.edu" if you connect from a university's domain) from which you access the website;   

  2. The IP address (an IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the Web) from which you access the website; and   

  3. The date and time of your access. 



We use this information to gather statistics about the amount of use the site receives. Again, we do not automatically record information about you as an individual. This information is not shared, sold, or otherwise disseminated by Arizona @ Your Service™. 

Although Arizona @ Your Service™ does not currently use cookies, future releases will necessitate their use along with other session enhancement methods. These will be thoroughly evaluated in order to determine their benefit to both the client and the service provider before being implemented. This privacy statement will also be updated to describe exactly what information is being collected and how to disable or refuse cookies. 

_Information You Provide_

Information collected from an application submitted online will be treated in the same manner as the information collected from an application submitted on a hard copy to the applicable State agency. The information you disclose to the agency (either through Arizona @ Your Service™ or directly) will generally become a matter of public record pursuant to A. R. S. §§ 39-121, et seq., which means that the agency may be required to divulge certain information in response to a public records request or in response to a warrant, subpoena, or other court order. 

The applicable State Agency website may require that you enter personal information (e.g., your name, home address, birth date, social security number, and credit card number) when applying for certain benefits and services described on that website.  Those services may also reference common infrastructure utilities that are provided by Arizona @ Your Service™. These utilities provide the agency with a means to obtain specific information or to facilitate a specific functional requirement of the online transaction being requested. 

As an example, Arizona @ Your Service™ maintains a central credit card payment interface that agencies can use as part of their online services applications. This utility will accept only the pertinent credit card authorization data necessary to validate and fulfill the purchase. The cardholder's name, credit card number, and expiration date are obtained by the utility and used only to complete the credit card payment portion of the online transaction. The data is used only for the fulfillment of the payment and is not retained by Arizona @ Your Service™. 

Not all agency online applications use the services of Arizona @ Your Service™, nor are they required to. Please be assured that your personal information will be held in strictest confidence while Arizona @ Your Service™ processes your online transaction and will not be shared, sold, or otherwise disseminated to any outside person or entity, except as required or authorized by law. 

Please refer to respective benefits and/or services web pages of each individual agency for disclosure of when, how, and to whom specific information will be released to third parties, as specified in A.R.S. § 41-4152 (5) and (6). If you have further questions regarding how a State agency will use the information you submit online, please contact the applicable agency directly. 

_Information Collected from Children_

By statute, all State agencies must comply with the Children’s Online Privacy Policy Protection Act of 1998 ("COPPA"), requiring parental consent before collecting any personal information from any individual under the age of 13. The text of COPPA is available at http://www.ftc.gov/ogc/coppa1.htm. 

The State of Arizona and its consultants, as developer and manager of Arizona @ Your Service™ web portal, have taken several steps to safeguard the integrity of its computer systems and networks. These steps include, but are not limited to individual authentication, the security of transmitted data, security monitoring, auditing, and encryption of your information. Security methods and measures have been integrated into the design, implementation and day-to-day practices of the entire Arizona @ Your Service™ web portal. 

Arizona @ Your Service™ contains links to various other web sites operated by other government agencies, nonprofit organizations and private businesses. When you link to another site, you are no longer on Arizona @ Your Service™ and this Privacy Statement will not apply to other sites. When you link to another web site, you are subject to the privacy policy of that new site.  Links to web sites outside of State government are offered solely for your convenience. The State of Arizona is not responsible for and has no control over the policies or content of any third-party sites. 

Neither the State of Arizona, nor any agency, officer, employee, or contractor of the State of Arizona warrants the accuracy, reliability, or timeliness of any information published by this system, nor endorses any content, viewpoints, products, or services linked from this system, and shall not be held liable for any losses caused by reliance on the accuracy, reliability or timeliness of such information. Portions of such information may be inaccurate or outdated. Any person or entity that relies on any information obtained from this system does so at his or her own risk. 

This policy may be updated or revised from time to time, so please check back with Arizona @ Your Service™ periodically in order to receive advance notice of any substantive changes to the manner in which the information you disclose on this web site may be collected, used, or disseminated.
