  * your IP address, 
  * browser and version, 
  * operating system, 
  * the pages you requested, 
  * date and time of your access and

## **Other External Links Disclaimer  
**Arizona Department of Revenue web pages contain links to various other web sites operated by other government agencies, nonprofit organizations, and private businesses. When you link to another site, you are no longer on the Arizona Unclaimed Property site and this Privacy Statement will not apply to other sites. When you link to another web site, you are subject to the privacy policy of that new site. Links to web sites outside of State government are offered solely for your convenience. No State of Arizona agency is responsible for or has control over the policies or content of any third-party sites.

Neither the State of Arizona, nor any agency, officer, employee, or contractor of the State of Arizona warrants the accuracy, reliability, or timeliness of any information published by this system, nor endorses any content, viewpoints, products, or services linked from this system, and shall not be held liable for any losses caused by reliance on the accuracy, reliability or timeliness of such information. Portions of such information may be inaccurate or outdated. Any person or entity that relies on any information obtained from this system does so at his or her own risk.
