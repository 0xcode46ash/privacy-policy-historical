A primary goal of FrogWatch USA is to maintain a universally accessible, centralized database of frog and toad observations. To this end, we have partnered with the National Geographic Society (NGS) under a National Science Foundation (NSF) grant to develop, implement and evaluate a web-based software platform called Fieldscope ([www.fieldscope.org](http://www.fieldscope.org/)) for the purpose of enabling FrogWatch USA volunteers to enter, view, manipulate and analyze their data. AZA will have access to information that you submit through the Fieldscope website in connection with FrogWatch USA. All data you may provide, such as details of an observation and its associated location (species, numbers, etc.), to AZA in connection with FrogWatch USA, through the Fieldscope website or otherwise, will be made available to all users registered with FrogWatch USA, NGS, NSF, scientists, and others who are interested in examining the distribution, abundance, and trends of North American frog and toad species. However, only information pertaining to frog and toad observations is available to FrogWatch USA users; no personal contact information is ever made public.

The Fieldscope website is owned and operated by the National Geographic Society and subject to its privacy policy posted thereon.

For more information regarding AZA’s rights to data provided to it in connection with FrogWatch USA, please read the Terms of Use on our website.
