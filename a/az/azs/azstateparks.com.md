# Arizona State Parks: Privacy Policy

Thank you for visiting Arizona State Parks’ website and reviewing our Privacy Policy Statement. Arizona State Parks provides information and services specific to Arizona State Parks and Natural Areas within Arizona as well as links to affiliates and organizations which partner with our Agency. This statement is included to inform you solely about the information that could be collected online as a result of visiting Arizona State Parks itself and not as a result of following a link from Arizona State Parks to reach a partnering entity’s website or online service. All individual agency websites of the State of Arizona are required to contain a Privacy Policy Statement that describes what information is being obtained online, how that information will be used, and what steps are being taken to ensure the security of customer data. Your rights to privacy are of utmost importance to us at Arizona State Parks in building trust and confidence when conducting business through the internet.

## Online Customer Service and Alternatives

Arizona State Parks offers many of the services online that you might otherwise transact in person. Our goal is to provide citizens with a more convenient and efficient means in which to interact with Arizona government. If at any time you choose not to proceed with a transaction offered through the Arizona State Parks’ website, your choice will in no way affect your ability to receive benefits or services. If you prefer to receive benefits or services in person, you may do so at our agency location.

**Information Collected and Stored Automatically**

The Arizona State Parks' website uses cookies. A “cookie” is a small text file that contains a string of alphanumeric characters. This site uses session cookies. A session cookie is held temporarily in your computer’s memory and disappears after you close your browser or shut off your computer. This session cookie helps the Arizona State Parks Research & Marketing department analyze how users interact with the website. No personally identifiable information is stored in this cookie.

  You can set your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being set.

  In the future Arizona State Parks may use persistent cookies which remain on your hard drive until you erase them or they expire. Persistent cookies could enhance subsequent website visits, and/or speed up or enhance our website's services or functions.

The web server that hosts Arizona State Parks does gather certain information about the visit automatically in a standard log file. This information never identifies you personally and consists of only the following items: 

1\. The Internet domain (for example, "xcompany.com" if you use a private Internet access account, or "yourschool.edu" if you connect from a university's domain) from which you access the website; 

2\. The IP address (an IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the Web) from which you access the website; and 

3\. The date and time of your access. 

We do not automatically record information about you as an individual. 

_**Information You Provide**_

Information collected from an application submitted online will be treated in the same manner as the information collected from an application submitted on a hard copy to Arizona State Parks. The information you disclose to us will generally become a matter of public record pursuant to A. R. S. §§ 39-121, et seq., which means that the agency may be required to divulge certain information in response to a public records request or in response to a warrant, subpoena, or other court order. 

Arizona State Parks may require that you enter personal information (e.g., your name, home address, and credit card number) when requesting certain goods or services described on our website. Those services may also reference common infrastructure utilities that are provided by Arizona @ Your Service. These utilities provide the agency with a means to obtain specific information or to facilitate a specific functional requirement of the online transaction being requested. 

As an example, Arizona @ Your Service maintains a central credit card payment interface that Arizona State Parks uses as part of our online gift shop service. This utility will accept only the pertinent credit card authorization data necessary to validate and fulfill the purchase. The cardholder's name, credit card number, and expiration date are obtained by the utility and used only to complete the credit card payment portion of the online transaction. The data is used only for the fulfillment of the payment and is not retained by Arizona @ Your Service. 

Not all online applications use the services of Arizona @ Your Service, nor are they required to. Please be assured that your personal information will be held in strictest confidence while Arizona State Parks processes your online transaction and will not be shared, sold, or otherwise disseminated to any outside person or entity, except as required or authorized by law. 

Please refer to respective benefits and/or services web pages of our agency for disclosure of when, how, and to whom specific information will be released to third parties, as specified by A.R.S. § 41-4152 (5) and (6). If you have further questions regarding how Arizona State Parks will use the information you submit online, please contact Arizona State Parks.

_**Third Party Disclosure**_

Third party organizations contracted with the State of Arizona may provide certain services available on the state’s behalf. Personal information collected through the web portal and/or over-the-counter may be provided to third party service providers to help the state deliver benefits and services. The state will take prudent steps to ensure that third-party organizations are obligated to secure and protect personal information on the State’s behalf. 

_**Information Collected from Children**_

By statute, all State agencies must comply with the Children’s Online Privacy Policy Protection Act of 1998 (“COPPA”), requiring parental consent before collecting any personal information from any individual under the age of 13. The text of COPPA is available at <http://www.ftc.gov/ogc/coppa1.htm>. 

_**Security**_

The State of Arizona and its consultants, as developer and manager of Arizona State Parks website, have taken several steps to safeguard the integrity of its computer systems and networks. These steps include, but are not limited to individual authentication, the security of transmitted data, security monitoring, auditing, and encryption of your information. Security methods and measures have been integrated into the design, implementation and day-to-day practices of the entire Arizona State Parks website.
