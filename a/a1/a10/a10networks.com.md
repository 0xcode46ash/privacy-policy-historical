PRIVACY POLICY 

This Privacy Policy is made available to you in order to make you aware of how A10 Networks, Inc. ("A10") collects and uses personal information you provide to us or collected via your visit to the A10 website. 

By accessing the A10 website, you consent to the terms of our Privacy Policy and to A10's processing of Personal Information for the purposes given below, as well as those that may appear on the web pages where you provide your Personal Information to us. For additional restrictions on your use of the website, please see our [Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/about/termsofuse.html) policy. 

**1\. Personal Information.**   
Your "Personal Information" is information that enables us to identify you, such as your email address, name and mailing address. 

**2\. Collection and Use of Personal Information.**   
When you browse our website, you do so anonymously, unless you have previously indicated that you wish A10 to remember your login and password or you expressly provide Personal Information to us. A10 may record information about your website visit, such as Internet domain and host names; Internet protocol (IP) addresses; browser software and operating system types; clickstream patterns; and dates and times that our site is accessed. 

A10 collects Personal Information when you register products with A10, register for a A10 account, when you use certain A10 products or services, when you register to obtain certain documents, when you register to attend a training session or class, when you ask to be included in an email or other mailing list, when you request information about A10 products or services, or when you submit your information to A10 for any other reason. 

A10 may use information you provide to us to contact you or your company for marketing purposes. If you choose to provide us with your Personal Information on the website, we may transfer that information within A10 or to A10's third party service providers, across borders and from your country or jurisdiction to other countries or jurisdictions around the world. 

**3\. Your Control Over Your Personal Information.**   
New registrants may choose to limit use of their Personal Information. We will always give you the opportunity to "opt out" of receiving direct marketing or market research information. This means we assume you have given us your consent to collect and use your information in accordance with this Privacy Policy, unless you take affirmative action to indicate that you do not consent, for instance by clicking or checking the appropriate option or box at the point of collection. In some cases, when applicable, we will provide you with the opportunity to "opt in." This means we will require your affirmative action to indicate your consent before we use your information for purposes other than the purpose for which it was submitted. 

When you sign up for an email list, you will be given instructions at that time on how to remove yourself from that list. 

Certain A10 web pages require a login and password for access. The use of those web pages and the information or programs downloadable from those pages are governed by a written agreement between your employer and/or A10 and the [Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/about/termsofuse.html). Your Personal Information may be retained by A10 to verify compliance with the agreements, track software downloaded from those pages and track use of other applications available on the A10 website. 

**4\. Security of Your Personal Information**   
A10 is committed to taking reasonable steps to protect the Personal Information that you provide to us. 

**5\. Corrections to Your Personal Information**   
The accuracy of your Personal Information is important to A10. You may contact us at the following e-mail addresses to request a change to your personally identifying information: inquire@a10networks.com. We will make a sincere effort to honor your wishes.
