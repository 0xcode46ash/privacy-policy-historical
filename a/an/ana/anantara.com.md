Minor Hotel Group Limited websites use the SSL encryption protocol (Norton Secured Seal, powered by VeriSign) to guarantee secure transactions and complete confidentiality. Your bank details and all the information you enter on the various forms are automatically encrypted when your data is transferred over the network using our SSL (Secure Socket Layer).  
SSL is the most widely used and successful secure transaction solution. The SSL encryption system automatically encrypts your data before it is transmitted over the network, and it can only be decrypted using a unique key once it has arrived on our server.  
If your browser supports this system, you will see a padlock or VeriSign symbol in the top or bottom right hand side of your screen.

This stay specific information is stored at the particular hotel where you stayed and is combined with information from previous visits that you have made to our hotels. We may also collect certain information as required by local laws (e.g. passport number).
