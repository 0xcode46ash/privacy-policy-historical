# Ananova - Privacy policy

**Privacy policy - What will we do with the information you give us**

Why we ask for information

Ananova Ltd asks for and holds information for three main reasons:

  1. To deliver a service to you. For example, we need your e-mail address before we can send you an e-mail news alert. Equally, by asking for your TV region, we can give you listings for the right channels every time you visit the site.
  2. To find out more about our users in general. This helps us improve our service to you, and allows us to give our advertisers and partners a clear idea of who uses our site and what their interests are. When we deal with information in this way, we do so only in aggregate - we do not identify users individually.
  3. To maximise the chances that the adverts or promotions we show you are of interest to you. These adverts and promotions help us keep the Ananova service free for our users.



**The information we collect**

As you use interactive and personalised features of the Ananova service, we will gather certain details for the purposes described above. Some details are voluntary, but the more you tell us about yourself, the better we are able to improve our service to you. You can amend the record of personal details you have supplied to us through a web page interface.

We log hits on our web pages and video streams and use them in aggregate to see what kind of users visit which parts of the site.

We encourage you to share your views and opinions with Ananova, and with your consent, may publish them for other users to see. In addition, we will not publish the e-mail addresses of opinion contributors without their consent.

**Sending you e-mail**

If you sign up for Ananova's alerting service, we will send you e-mail to alert you to stories that match your personal alerting profile. These e-mails may contain targeted promotional messages. In addition, we may send further promotional e-mails if you give your consent. If you have given your consent, you can withdraw it, and we will stop sending you additional promotional e-mails.

**Using cookies**

Cookies are small files that are placed on your computer by your browser. We use them to save information that helps you make the most of Ananova - for example, we store your TV region so you don't have to choose it every time you visit the site. You can disable cookies by changing your browser preferences, but may find you have to enter the same information over and over again if you use a personalised part of the Ananova service regularly.

**Protecting your privacy**

For some parts of the Ananova service, we may issue you with a PIN or password which allows you to access and amend your personal details. It is your responsibility to keep this PIN or password secret. We will strive to protect your personal information, but because of the way information is transmitted over the Internet, we cannot guarantee its security.

**Sharing your personal details with third parties**

Our dealings with your personal information are governed by this simple principle: we will not disclose your personal details to a third party without your consent.

Occasions when we might seek your consent include competitions, when the prizes have been supplied by a third party with whom we have agreed to share our information. If this is the case, we will say so in the competition pages.

**Sharing aggregate data with third parties**

"Aggregate data" is information about groups of users which does not enable individuals to be identified. We may share this kind of information to advertisers, commercial partners and other third parties.

**Information not covered by this policy**

Certain adverts on Ananova may be served to you by a third party who is not covered by this policy. Currently, we use DoubleClick, whose own privacy statement can be seen [here](http://www.doubleclick.net/company_info/about_doubleclick/privacy)

Certain links on Ananova may take you to co-branded pages hosted by one of our business partners. Such pages are not covered by this policy.

**Changes to this policy**

Our privacy policy may change from time to time. If it does, we will update this page.
