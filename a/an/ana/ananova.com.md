9\. Cookies

9.1 The Ananova Service makes use of "cookies". A cookie is a small text file which is placed on your hard disk. Cookies contain information about you and your chosen preferences. For example, it might contain a record of which pages within the Ananova website you visited, to help us customise the website for you the next time you visit.

9.2 Only the information that you provide, or the choices you make, while visiting the Ananova website can be stored in a cookie. For example, the Ananova website cannot determine your email address unless you choose to type it. Allowing Orange to create a cookie does not give Orange access to the rest of your computer and only Orange can read it.

9.3 Orange will only use the cookies created to enhance your experience. What this means is that when you use the site Orange will be able to keep certain settings for you for when you return. It also means that you do not need to choose options such as your TV or weather region every time you visit the site as we store them for you during the time you spend browsing our site.
