# Privacy & Security Statement | Analog Devices

#### COLLECTION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION

Visitors to the Analog Devices, Inc. ("ADI") Web site (the "Site") may use many of the Site’s features without revealing any information that ADI can use to identify visitors personally, such as name, address, phone number or email address (“personal information”). However, in some instances, ADI requests that users provide certain personal information in order to facilitate future communications, make a purchase of Analog Devices products, or receive software, tools, information or other materials from ADI. This policy sets forth the practices that Analog Devices intends to follow with respect to such personal information, as well as other information that can be used to identify a visitor’s computer or device. The Analog Devices policy governing the personal information of employees, independent contractors, consultants and job applicants can be found [here](http://www.analog.com/en/careers/job-search/content/global_data_privacy_policy/fca.html). 

#### DECLINING THE COLLECTION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION

To the extent that ADI seeks personal information from you, you will be prompted to provide that information, but you will always have the choice to decline to provide the information and not receive the services or materials from ADI.

#### COOKIES, WEB BEACONS, AND OTHER ONLINE TRACKING TOOLS

ADI is continuously evaluating and improving the Site’s performance, navigation and ease of use. We are also striving to improve the effectiveness of our email communications. In order to help us meet these commitments, we use cookies, web beacons, and other online tracking tools to understand how the Site is being navigated and used, and to evaluate the impact of our email campaigns. A cookie is a tiny piece of text placed on your computer's hard drive. A web beacon is a small electronic file that generally consists of a single-pixel image that is placed on a web page or email and is used to transmit certain types of information. The purpose of these and other online tracking tools is to let ADI know when you visit the Site and how you use the Site. These tools also allow ADI to track your use of the Site over time and associate that data with other information, such as your IP address. They also can provide information about your responses to our emails. ADI does not collect from cookies, web beacons, or other tracking tools any personal information that you have not already disclosed, but information from these tools may be linked to personal information that you have chosen to disclose. 

The advantage to you as a visitor to the Site is that information requested by us for purchasing ADI products will be pre-filled for you based on the ID we collect via a cookie. This saves you time in filling out information when visiting the Site and requesting information or samples, or when signing up for myAnalog, or any other function within the Site that requires registration. We also use information from cookies and other online tracking tools to identify ways to improve the Site. 

ADI also uses these tools in its online advertising efforts. For example, we use these tools to tailor the communications that we send to you, including marketing messages and online ads.

ADI partners with certain third-party service providers to collect and analyze the information discussed above. These third parties may use web beacons and web logs or set and access cookies on your computer or other device. 

Finally, third party vendors, including Google, show relevant ADI ads on third party sites on the Internet. These third party vendors use cookies to serve you relevant ads based on your prior visits to the ADI website. You may opt out of Google's use of cookies by visiting the [Google advertising opt-out page](http://www.google.com/privacy/ads/). You may also opt out of other third party vendors’ use of cookies by visiting the [Network Advertising Initiative opt-out page](http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp).

If you have any further questions, please feel free to contact [external.webmaster@analog.com](mailto:external.webmaster@analog.com). 

#### HOW ADI USES AND SHARES YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION

ADI will use the personal information you provide for legitimate business purposes, such as to facilitate future communications with you, assist you in making a purchase of ADI products, respond to your request for ADI information and materials, or inform you about products or services that might interest you. ADI will share your personal information with authorized third parties in connection with fulfillment of legitimate business uses that are intended to serve you, such as shipping products or materials requested by you. ADI also may share your information with our distribution partners and others in order for them to provide you with information about ADI and other products and services that we believe may be of interest to you. In addition, ADI reserves the right to collect and share personal information as part of (i) an investigation or response to a violation of ADI terms and conditions of use, fraud, illegal activities or other actions or threats that may damage ADI, the Site, or other property, or injure or threaten ADI's customers or other persons, (ii) compliance with a court order, subpoena, government investigation or other legal process, or (iii) transfer or sale of a business unit. Finally, ADI uses third-party platforms to store, analyze, and manage certain personal and other information, which helps ADI improve its operations, marketing and customer service and more effectively tailor our communications with you. 

#### REMOVAL AND UPDATING OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION

If at any time you wish to have ADI remove your personal information from its database, or to make other changes, please notify ADI at [external.webmaster@analog.com](mailto:external.webmaster@analog.com). Similarly, if you need to update or expand upon any other information you have provided to ADI, you can re-enter that information at the relevant prompt, or notify ADI by e-mail of this additional information at [external.webmaster@analog.com](mailto:external.webmaster@analog.com).

#### SECURITY STATEMENT: HOW ADI PROTECTS YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION

ADI has implemented reasonable information security practices designed to help safeguard your personal information. We do not authorize ADI employees or our service providers to access or use this information unless they have a need to know it in connection with performing their employment duties or providing services to ADI. ADI does not use credit card information for any purpose other than to process payment for sales, and does not provide your credit card information to anyone other than the financial services institutions and contractors responsible for the confidential processing of your payment.

While ADI will continue to exercise diligence and use reasonable measures to protect the security of this Site, ADI cannot warrant that all internet communications will be absolutely secure. If you have any questions about this Security Statement, please contact [external.webmaster@analog.com](mailto:external.webmaster@analog.com).

ADI is committed to the responsible use of the Internet. ADI reserves the right to change or amend its privacy and security statement from time to time, but will post any such changes on this Site.
