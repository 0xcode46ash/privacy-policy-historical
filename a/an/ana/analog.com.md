**Policy on Privacy of Personal Information**

Analog Devices frequently communicates with customers, users and others through its site on the World Wide Web. Visitors to Analog Devices' Web site are not required to reveal any information about themselves. However, in some instances, Analog Devices' Web site may give visitors the opportunity to provide information in order to facilitate future communications, make a purchase of Analog Devices' products, or receive Analog Devices information and materials. This policy sets forth the practices that Analog Devices intends to follow with respect to such personal information.  
  
   
  
**When will the Analog Devices Web site collect information from me?**

The Analog Devices Web site does not automatically collect information about visitors. To the extent that Analog Devices seeks information from you, you will be prompted to provide that information; you will be told what use Analog Devices plans to make of the information; and you will be given the opportunity to decline to provide the information.  
  
   
  
**What uses does Analog Devices make of this information?**

The sole use Analog Devices will make of any information you provide will be to facilitate future communications with you, assist you in making a purchase of Analog Devices' products, or respond to your request for Analog Devices information and materials. Analog Devices will not provide your information to any third party. Under certain circumstances, your information will be forwarded to Analog Devices authorized sales representatives and distributors for action.  
  
   
  
**What if I change my mind?**

If at any time you wish to have Analog Devices remove your information from its database, please notify us at [external.webmaster@analog.com](mailto:external.webmaster@analog.com). Similarly, if you need to update or expand upon any other information you have provided to us, you can re-enter that information at the relevant prompt, or notify us by e-mail of this additional information.  
  
   
  
**What does Analog Devices do to protect the information I provide?**

Analog Devices provides three levels of protection. First, access to the servers that store your information is limited to those Analog Devices employees with a need to know the information. Second, Analog Devices' servers use commercially-available security measures to prevent unauthorized access. Finally, when you purchase Analog Devices products through our Web site, Analog Devices will take reasonable steps to establish a secure connection to your Web browser. Analog Devices does not use credit card information for any purpose other than to process payment for sales, and does not provide your credit card information to anyone else.

Analog Devices is committed to the responsible use of the World Wide Web. Analog Devices reserves the right to change or amend this policy from time to time, but will post any such changes on this site.
