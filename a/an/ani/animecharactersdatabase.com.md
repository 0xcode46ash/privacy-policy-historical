    This information is to be used only for investigating suspicious account activity. 
    

## Updated: May 15th, 2011
    
    
    Time for a new Privacy Policy.
    
    Change Number 1: We no long use Google Analytics Tracking services.
    
    We do our best to balance the need for Ad Revenue and respecting your privacy.
    
    All members have the option to Turn Off Ads by clicking a button in the side menu.
    Anyone can visit the Privacy Policy and click a similar button within the page.
    
    We try to minimize the amount of 3rd party content on the site.
    I can't stand web sites that connect to hundreds of third party sources,
     so I wont force that on the users of my web site.
    Where there are member comments, you may encounter 3rd party hosted Avatars,
     or linked images in comments.
    
    Anime Characters Database can be fully used with JavaScript turned off,
     and works great with NoScript ( a firefox extension ).
    Such a choice will make us worry about paying our hosting bills,
     but offers you faster browsing speeds, and max privacy!
    
    We do collect standard web access logs.
    These contain:
     - IP address
     - request time
     - request type
     - request URL
     - referrer URL
     - user agent
     - transfer size
     - status code
    We keep these logs for roughly a year.
    We do not sell our access logs.
    We do not share entire logs with anyone.
    Sections of logs may be made public.
    
    Our database at most records:
     - IP address
     - user agent
     - time
    as identifying markers when you post content to the site.
    The purpose being to identify spammers, and quickly remove related spam.
    
    We also maintain a usage stats table, which contains:
     - time first seen
     - time last seen
     - page requests
     - online today marker
     - ip address
     - session cookie
     - user agent
    Purpose: 
     - maintain a reliable user session
     - detect and prevent Denial of Service attacks
    
    Members are free to submit as much or as little personal information in their
     account profiles. 
    We try hard to maintain an unusually high level of server security.
    While we do have substantial security preventing intrusion, we have also
     spent vast amounts of time and effort obscuring the internals of our system
     to a point that should a hacker gain access, they will have a very foreign, 
     very limited system opened to them.

Final Fantasy VII is probably one of the best games I have ever played in my entire life.  
It also has one of the most emotional and sadest scenes/moments I have ever seen in a videogame. (it made me cry, seriously)  
Now I heard that there is a remake of Final Fantasy VII coming up for the Playstation 4 eventually, if I´m not mistaken. (I don´t know the release date yet though, but I hope it will be soon)   
Hopefully, they haven´t changed the game story that much, because that would ruin the whole thing with this legendary game. I do know that the graphics and the music will have a much cooler and a much better improvement though.   
Man, I just can´t wait for it to come out!
