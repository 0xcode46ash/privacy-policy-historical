# Anime Online - Anime Online Privacy Statement

**Animeonline/EverythingAnime Privacy Information**

Your privacy is very important to us. We DO NOT sell or share your personal information or email address with ANY third party. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for the websites:  http://www.animeonline.net /  http://www.everything-anime.com

The following policy outlines the types of information that we gather about you and the way that way we use and don't use this information. 

The information that we collect about our visitors falls into three general categories: 1\. _Information You Provide to Us_. We may collect and store information, personal or otherwise, that you voluntarily supply to us either on the AnimeOnline site, via e-mail, or in any other way. Some examples of this type of information include the information you submit (such as your name or e-mail address) when you register for an account,Â  information that you post on message boards, and information contained in search requests or questions you submit to the site. If you decline to supply or provide us with certain information, we may not be able to provide you with some services that are dependent on the collection of this information. 2\. _Information that is Automatically Collected._ We also collect and store information that is generated automatically as you navigate through the AnimeOnline site. For example, to enhance your experience at AnimeOnline, we use a standard feature found in browser software called a "cookie." Cookies are small files that your web browser places on your hard drive for record-keeping purposes. By showing how and when visitors use our site, cookies help us track user trends and patterns. They also prevent you from having to re-enter your preferences on certain areas of our site where you have entered preference information before. Another example of information that we automatically collect as you navigate our site is information about your computer's connection to the Internet. This information allows us, among other things, to improve the delivery of our web pages to you and to measure traffic on our site. How is the Information Used? AnimeOnline uses the information it collects in a variety of ways, including, using the information to customize features and that appear on the AnimeOnline site. Please also keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information online - for example on message boards, through gallery, or in other areas - that information can be seen, collected and used by others besides AnimeOnline. AnimeOnline cannot be responsible for any unauthorized third party use of information that you disclose online. Be aware that we may occasionally release information about our visitors when release is appropriate to comply with law, to enforce our Terms of Service agreement, or to protect the rights, property or safety of visitors to our sites, the public, or AnimeOnline. **Children's Privacy Statement for AnimeOnline** This children's privacy statement explains our practices with respect to the online collection and use of personal information from children under the age of thirteen, and provides important information on your rights under federal law with respect to such information. 

  * We do NOT knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of thirteen. We screen users who wish to provide personal information in order to prevent users under the age of thirteen from providing such information.

If we change our practices in the future, we will obtain prior, verifiable parental consent before collecting any personally identifiable information from children under the age of thirteen. 
  * Because we do not collect any personally identifiable information from children under the age of thirteen, we also do NOT knowingly distribute such information to third parties.
