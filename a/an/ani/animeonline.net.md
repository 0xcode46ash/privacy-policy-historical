# Anime Online - Privacy Statement

Your privacy is very important to us, and as a result, we DO NOT sell or share your personal information or email address with ANY 3rd party. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for this website [www.animeonline.net](http://www.animeonline.net/).

This Privacy Statement also outlines the types of information that we gather about you and the way that way we use this information.

The information we collects can be categorized into 3 categories:

  1. **_Information You Provide to Us._** We may collect and store information, personal or otherwise, that you voluntarily supply to us either on the AnimeOnline site, via email, or in any other way. Some examples of this type of information include the information you submit (such as your name or email address) when you register for an account,Â information that you post on the forums, and information contained in search requests or questions you submit to the site. If you decline to supply or provide us with certain information, we may not be able to provide you with some services that are dependent on the collection of this information.
  2. **_Information that is Automatically Collected._** We also collect and store information that is generated automatically as you navigate through the AnimeOnline site. For example, to enhance your experience at AnimeOnline, we use a standard feature found in browser software called a "cookie." Cookies are small files that your web browser places on your hard drive for record-keeping purposes. By showing how and when visitors use our site, cookies help us track user trends and patterns. They also prevent you from having to re-enter your preferences on certain areas of our site where you have entered preference information before. Another example of information that we automatically collect as you navigate our site is information about your computer's connection to the Internet. This information allows us, among other things, to improve the delivery of our web pages to you and to measure traffic on our site.

_Use of Information_

AnimeOnline uses the information it collects in a variety of ways, including, using the information to customize features that appear on the AnimeOnline site.

Please also keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information online - for example on forums, through the gallery, or in other areas - that information can be seen, collected and used by others besides AnimeOnline. AnimeOnline cannot be held responsible for any unauthorized third party use of information that you disclose online. Be aware that we may occasionally release information about our visitors when release is appropriate to comply with the law, to enforce our Terms of Service agreement, or to protect the rights, property or safety of visitors to AnimeOnline or the general public.

**Children's Privacy Statement**

  * We do NOT knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13. We screen users who wish to provide personal information in order to prevent users under the age of 13 from providing such information.

If we change our practices in the future, we will obtain prior, verifiable parental consent before collecting any personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13.
  * Because we do not collect any personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13, we also do NOT knowingly distribute such information to 3rd parties.
