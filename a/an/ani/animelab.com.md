The Animeland Network(ALN), it's advertisers and affiliates are deeply committed to protecting the privacy of Internet users. Below is information outlining our continued support for the responsible management of consumer information.

**Consumer Information**

During the process of visiting our web sites, ALN does not collect any personally identifiable information about you such as name, address, phone number, or e-mail address. However, ALN does obtain some types of non-personally identifiable information such as the Internet Service Provider you use to connect to the Internet, your browser type, or the type of computer operating system you use (Macintosh or Windows, for example). The information collected by ALN is used for the purpose of targeting advertising.

In some cases, you may voluntarily provide personal information in response to a specific advert (this ad may ask you to fill out a survey or provide year zip code). If this does occur, ALN may collect this information on behalf of an advertiser. This information is used by an advertiser to respond to your request. In addition, ALN may combine this information with other users information and review it in an aggregate form to understand the type of individuals who view a specific type of ad or visit a particular kind of website.

**Data Collection**

ALN, as well as most sites on the Internet, use "cookies" to enhance your experience on the web. ALN cannot use these cookies to personally identify you in any way. What are cookies and why do we use them? A cookie is a piece of data that is provided to you the first time you visit a website. This unique data may later be recovered from your computer. This cookie can help ALN ensure that we don't serve you the same ad multiple times, and help our advertisers understand what you like and don't like about their offerings so that they can cater better to your needs the next time you are interested in their products or services. We believe that cookies enhance your Internet experience.
