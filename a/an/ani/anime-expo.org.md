PRIVACY POLICY for ONLINE REGISTRATION

The following is the Anime Expo® 2008 Online Registration Privacy Policy ("Privacy Policy") located within the website, www.anime-expo.org. If you have objections to the Privacy Policy, you should not register for Anime Expo® 2008 using the online registration form. This Privacy Policy does not apply to offline activities or other online activities associated with The Society for the Promotion of Japanese Animation’s (“SPJA”) Anime Expo® 2008 website. Using the online registration form is your agreement to the terms of this Privacy Policy.  
The SPJA respects your privacy and is committed to protecting the personal information that you may provide while using the online registration form. This Privacy Policy is intended to provide you with notice of the following: 

  * The web site covered by this Privacy Policy
  * Our policy concerning children
  * What personal information we collect from you
  * Information on "cookies" and related technology
  * How we use and share the information that we collect from you
  * How you may access or change the information you have provided to us
  * Information for persons outside the United States
  * Our commitment to secure the personal information we have collected
  * Notice of changes to the Privacy Policy



**• The web sites and services covered by this Policy**

The following website contains the online registration form to which this Privacy Policy applies:  
www.anime-expo.org

**• Our policy concerning children**

Because our registration form is directed to a general audience including children above the age of 5, SPJA will collect personal information. **If you are between the ages of 5 and 18, please let your parent or guardian know about this policy and get his or her permission before you give us any of your personal identifiable information.**

SPJA encourages parents and guardians to register on behalf of their children. If you are a parent or guardian who has discovered that your child has submitted his or her personal information without your permission or consent, SPJA will take reasonable efforts to remove that information from the registration database at your request. To request removal of your child’s information, please send us an e-mail via the contact form on the Anime Expo® 2008 website and be sure to include in your message the registration name that your child submitted. If your child has used your credit card on our web sites without your permission, contact us immediately.

**• What personal information we collect from you**

We do not collect any personal information from you, unless you provide it to us voluntarily. If you decide to provide us your personal information (e.g., name, email address, and mailing address), we will only collect the identifying personal information which is needed to complete the registration process for Anime Expo® 2008. Nonidentifying personal information, such as from a survey, is used to compile demographics for marketing purposes only. If you refuse to provide your personal information on the registration form, your attendee registration may not be completed and you will not be able to attend Anime Expo® 2008.

**• Information on cookies and related technology**

SPJA’s Anime Expo® 2008 website may contain "cookies." A cookie is a piece of data that is sent to your browser, which will store the cookie on your computer if your browser is enabled to accept cookies. Clear gifs (also known as "web beacons") assist in the delivery of cookies.

SPJA may use cookies, clear gifs, frames, server log analysis or other technology to customize your experience with our site. Personal information collected through the use of these technologies will be handled according to this Privacy Policy.

Most internet browsers will allow you to erase cookies from your computer hard drive, block acceptance of cookies, or receive a warning before a cookie is stored. You should refer to your browser instructions or "Help" screen to learn more about how to manage cookies. Please note, however, that if you block cookies, the online registration form may not function properly.

**• How we use and share the information that we collect from you**

Personal information which we collect for a particular purpose will only be saved and used for that purpose. For example, when you register online for an attendee badge, and unless you have given us permission to do otherwise, we will only collect and save the personal information you provided to us, including your billing and delivery information, in order to (1) complete the sale, (2) comply with tax and other applicable statutes, (3) maintain accurate business and financial records (in accordance with accepted standards), and (4) assist with customer service and returns.

When you have provided personal information to us for a particular purpose, we may disclose your information to other companies that we have engaged to assist us in fulfilling your request. This may include, but is not limited to, fulfillment houses, transaction managers, credit verification services, and other service providers. We may also disclose your personal information to law enforcement or other appropriate third parties in connection with criminal investigations, investigation of fraud, infringement of intellectual property rights, or other suspected illegal activities, or as otherwise may be required by applicable law, or in order to protect the legitimate legal and business interests of SPJA.

We send e-mail to our registered attendees who want to receive e-mail from us. However, if you don’t want to receive e-mail from us, you can "opt out" of receiving it. If you change your mind and wish to stop receiving e-mails from us, you may also choose to opt out by contacting us via the online contact form found within the Anime Expo® 2008 website. (Select the Registration Department)

Except as described in this policy, we will not give any of your personal information to any third party without your express approval, and the only personal information we will ask you if you want us to share with third parties is your name, your mailing address and e-mail address. We sometimes share general, demographic, or aggregated (not personal) information with third parties about our user base, but that information does not include any personal information.

**• How you may access or change the information you have provided to us**

If you change your mind and do not want to receive e-mails from us, you may send an e-mail via the Anime Expo® 2008 contact form. Subject to security and privacy concerns (e.g., regarding your credit card number), we will give you the ability to review, correct and/or update your information. If you choose to have your personal information removed from our active databases, we will do so within a reasonable time after your request and we will take reasonable steps to ensure that your personal data is not used (except as may be required by law) by SPJA after your notification to us.

Removal of your personal information from our database will require the cancellation of your registration as the information you provide is used as a security measure to protect your registration from theft or other forms of fraud.

**• Information for persons outside the United States**

By consenting to this policy, you confirm that your command and knowledge of English is sufficient to understand the terms and conditions set forth herein.

**• Our commitment to secure the personal information we have collected**

While SPJA takes precautions against possible breaches in its websites and attendee databases, no web site or Internet transmission is completely secure. Consequently, SPJA cannot guarantee that unauthorized access, hacking, data loss, or other breaches will never occur. Your use of the SPJA sites and services is at your own risk.

Whenever you give SPJA sensitive or confidential information (for example, credit card numbers for purchases), SPJA will take commercially reasonable efforts to protect the information by establishing a secure connection with your web browser. Unless otherwise specified herein or on the site where you make a purchase, credit card numbers are used only for payment processing and are not retained for marketing purposes.

**• Notice of changes to the Privacy Policy**

SPJA reserves the right to change this Privacy Policy at any time by notification via e-mail of the existence of a new Privacy Policy and/or posting the new Privacy Policy on the SPJA sites. All changes to the Privacy Policy will be effective when posted, and your continued use of any SPJA site or service after the posting will constitute your acceptance of, and agreement to be bound by those changes.
