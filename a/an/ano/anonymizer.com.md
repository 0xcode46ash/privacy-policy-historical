# Anonymizer Privacy Policy

  
Anonymizer Privacy Policy  
Updated August 25, 2004

**  
** As the leader in Internet privacy & security solutions, Anonymizer knows the value of information and understands your concerns about privacy. As a result, we believe that you have the right to know how we collect and use your personal information. Anonymizer values your trust and respects your privacy — and is committed to protecting them.

  
Anonymizer is the sole owner of the information collected on this site. We will not sell, rent, trade or lease this information to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement. We will only share information with third-party agents who provide services for our internal business operations. These agents must comply with our privacy policies and cannot use your personal data for any other purpose. For example, we currently use Lyris ListManager to send Anonymizer email campaigns to our subscribers. Lyris simply provides the technology to send these email campaigns and they are in strict compliance with Anonymizer’s privacy policy. 

When you place an order, email technical support, download software or respond to our promotional campaigns we will gather certain personal information from you to respond to your request. For example, we will collect information such as your credit card number, contact information, billing and shipping address and use it to complete your order (anonymous cash payment is also available). If we have trouble processing an order, this contact information is used to get in touch with you. 

For your protection, all information on the order sheet, including credit card holder's name, number, billing address, is subject to verification prior to processing any order. This is to prevent fraud, and the unlikely use of the credit card without the cardholder's permission. Your billing information is in no way correlated with your Internet activities because our billing system and Anonymizer privacy and security services run totally independently. Please note that customers using Total Net Shield are provided an anonymous email address that correlates in our system back to their username and real identity. We may use aggregate information to improve our website, but that information is never personally identifiable. 

  
Anonymizer does not intend to collect information from children who are under the age of 18 in the European Union and Asia Pacific, or under the age of 13 in the United States and Latin America. If you do not meet these age limits, you should not provide information on this site and should ask your parent or guardian to do so for you.

  
Like most companies, Anonymizer uses cookies to customize our communication and provide you with better service. A cookie is a small data file that our website writes to your hard drive when you visit our site. That file may contain information that we use to track the Web pages you have visited or how often you've visited Anonymizer's site. The primary reason Anonymizer uses cookies is to prepare customized pages for you. However, a cookie cannot read data off your computer's hard disk. You can also set your browser to warn you before accepting cookies, or you can refuse cookies by turning them off in your browser.

  
Anonymizer will not sell, rent, trade, or lease your personal information for marketing purposes. We will only share information with third-party agents who provide services for our internal business operations. These agents must comply with our privacy policies and cannot use your personal data for any other purpose. Apart from this, we disclose personal information only in the good faith belief that we are required to do so by law, or that doing so is reasonably necessary to: comply with legal process; respond to any spamming and related abuses of netiquette claims; or protect the rights, property or personal safety of Anonymizer, our customers, or the public. Note: Anonymizer does not hold any personal information on our customers that could result in compromising their privacy and security. 

Note to European Customers: The information you provide us will be transferred outside the European Economic Area for the purpose of processing by Anonymizer, Inc., its affiliates and agents. By submitting your information, you agree to that international transfer.

**If you forget your password** , you will be unable to access your account. Anonymizer provides anonymity and therefore keeps as little information as possible on our customers, including their passwords. It is highly recommended that you record your username and password in a secure place for future reference.

Anonymizer will take all reasonable steps to the extent permitted by law to ensure that access information about you is restricted to those Anonymizer personnel who are required to have access to the information in order to enable Anonymizer to provide the Customer with service. Anonymizer reserves the right to disclose your information in the following cases: 

  * You are found in violation of the terms of use, or you have abused the service by using it to attack other systems or to gain unauthorized access to any other system. 
  * If at any time you violate the Anti-Spam policy or engage in Spamming, which is defined as posting large volumes of unsolicited email or other postings. 
  * When required by law or by order of a court. 



With the exceptions noted above, the parties’ obligations as to confidentiality shall survive any termination of this Agreement. This privacy policy does not apply to usage logs. Usage logs do not reveal any personally identifiable information, and are only used for the purpose of tracking system abuse and spam. Use logs may be kept for a period of 48 hours for the above stated purpose. However, if a pattern of abuse is found, the usage logs may be retained to investigate the abuse. 

**Disclaimer:** Anonymizer is dedicated to continually improving its websites by adding new functionality, products, services and programs. Because of those improvements — along with the changes in the law, technology, and Anonymizer's business — Anonymizer reserves the right to change, modify, add, or remove portions of this Privacy Policy at any time. The latest version of our privacy policy will be available on our web site and will indicate the date that it went into affect. We encourage you to review our Privacy Policy whenever you use this website to make sure you always understand how your information will be used.
