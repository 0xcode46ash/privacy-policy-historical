# Anonymizer Privacy Policy

**[Unsubscribe from our mailing list](https://web.archive.org/consumer/mailinglist_management.html)**

Date Updated: November 26, 2007 

**At Anonymizer, we do more than help you protect your privacy.**

As the leader in Internet privacy & security solutions, Anonymizer knows the value of information and understands your concerns about privacy. As a result, we believe that you have the right to know how we collect and use your personal information. Anonymizer values your trust and respects your privacy — and is committed to protecting them. 

**What customer information does Anonymizer gather and use?**

Anonymizer is the sole owner of the information collected on this site. We will not sell, rent, trade or lease this information to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this policy. 

When you place an order, download software, respond to our promotional campaigns, request email technical support or otherwise communicate with us about our goods or services, we will gather, retain and use certain personal information you provide to us. For example, we may collect information such as your name, contact information including address, telephone number and email address, credit card number, bank account number, your billing and shipping address, and records of the kinds of products and services you have purchased from us or are interested in. We will use this information to complete your order (anonymous cash payment is also available), respond to your request or communication, to assist us in providing our products and services to you, and to manage our relationship with you. By furnishing any such information to us, you expressly consent to the use of your information in accordance with the terms of this privacy policy. 

For your protection, all information with respect to an order, including the credit card holder's name, number and billing address, is subject to verification prior to processing any order. This is to assist us in preventing fraud and the unauthorized use of a credit card without the cardholder's permission. Records of your billing information are kept separately from records of your Internet activities because our billing system and Anonymizer privacy and security services run independently. 

When you use Anonymizer services, our servers may automatically record the information that your browser sends whenever you visit a Web site. We may maintain usage logs containing a record of Web access made to and through our service. These server logs may include such information as your Web request, Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request, the size in kilobytes of the communication, and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser. (See discussion of cookies, below.) Anonymizer may use this data individually or in the aggregate with other users’ data for our internal marketing purposes or to improve our services. Anonymizer also uses this data for the purposes of tracking system abuse and spamming. 

Customers using Nyms and Total Net Shield are provided an anonymous email address that correlates in our system back to their username and real identity. Unless addressed to us, we do not read email messages, instant messages, online chats, or the content of other online communications that pass through our service. Anonymizer will not disclose customer identities or information concerning email communication except as stated below in the discussion of our information sharing practices. 

**Will Anonymizer share my information with other companies or people?**

Anonymizer will not sell, rent, trade, or lease your personal information for marketing purposes. We may share information with third parties who furnish services necessary to provide you with the products and services offered by us but only if these third parties agree to comply with our privacy policies and not use your personal data for any other purpose. Apart from this, we disclose personal information only when we have a good faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of such information is reasonably necessary to (a) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request, (b) enforce applicable terms of use or other contract rights, including investigation of potential violations thereof, (c) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues (including abuse of our products or services by spamming or other abuses of netiquette, and use of our products or services to attack other systems or to gain unauthorized access to any other system) or (d) protect against imminent harm to the rights, property or safety of Anonymizer, our customers or the public. Please note that if Anonymizer sells all or a portion of its business or assets, Anonymizer reserves the right to transfer customer information to the acquirer as part of that acquisition. 

Note to European Customers: The information you provide us will be transferred outside the European Economic Area for the purpose of processing by Anonymizer, Inc., its affiliates and agents. By submitting your information, you agree to that international transfer. 

**Does Anonymizer use Cookies?**

Like most companies, Anonymizer uses cookies to customize our communication and provide you with better service. A cookie is a small data file that our Web site writes to your hard drive when you visit our site. That file may contain information that we use to track the Web pages you have visited or how often you've visited Anonymizer's site. The primary reason Anonymizer uses cookies is to prepare customized pages for you. However, a cookie cannot read data off your computer's hard disk. You can also set your browser to warn you before accepting cookies, or you can refuse cookies by turning them off in your browser. 

**Does Anonymizer collect information on minors?**

Anonymizer does not intend to collect information from children who are under the age of 18 in the European Union and Asia Pacific, or under the age of 13 in the United States and Latin America. If you do not meet these age limits, you should not provide information on this site and should ask your parent or guardian to do so for you. 

**How can I manage my personal information or unsubscribe from emails?**

Anonymizer maintains the following procedures for you to review or request changes to the information that we collect about you.
