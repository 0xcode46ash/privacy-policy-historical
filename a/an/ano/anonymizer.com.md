The Anonymizer provides services which allow the anonymous use of Internet resources such as email, usenet, and the web. Because our business is privacy and anonymity, we do not require that users provide any personally identifiable information to use our services. User Log Files   
No information connecting a user name or the identity of a user (IP address for example) with the sites being visited is ever kept any where in any form. Our log files do not contain usernames or user IP addresses. Additionally, they are purged every 48 hours. Our own system administrators can not tell who is looking at what, even in real time with root access to the servers. Information this Site Gathers/Tracks   
The only personally identifiable information we collect is user email addresses for paying customers. For users who choose to pay by credit card we must collect personal information such as the card number, expiration date, card holders name, card verification value (CVV2) (except when using an American Express card), and billing address for AVS security. This information is stored in our credit card database for payment, refund, and charge back purposes only. Use of the Information this Site Gathers/Tracks   
User email addresses are used exclusively to notify the user of changes to our services which will affect the user directly, and to notify the user of the impending expiration of the account. Credit card information is used exclusively for payments, refunds, and charge backs. Sharing of the Information this Site Gathers/Tracks   
Anonymizer never shares any personally identifiable information with any other company, organization or individual. 

No personally identifiable information at all is collected for users of the free Anonymizer service. The provision of all personally identifiable information is voluntary.
