Last modified: June 1, 2016

### COLLECTION:

We collect two types of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) on our Website. This information is used to provide users with the Anova service and to better allow us to understand how visitors navigate our website.

Purchase Information: If you purchase your Anova from our website, we collect your name, billing and shipping address, credit card information and any other information necessary to complete the transaction.

Website Use Information:Like many websites, we use tools (including Google analytics) to collect information from visitors in order to better understand how they use our website (e.g., browser type, domains, page views). We use session cookies to keep you logged in while you use features of our web application; these disappear after you close your browser. We also use persistent cookies which stay in your browser and allow us to recognize you when you return to the site. Most Internet browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can change the settings to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. If you turn off cookies, parts of our Website may not work for you.

We also use an advertising service that uses cookies to market Anova services to you on other websites. If you prefer not to use these cookies, you can opt-out in some browsers by turning on “Do Not Track” or visit http://www.aboutads.info/choices to opt-out directly.

### TRANSFER:

We do not rent or sell our customer lists. We may share your personally identifiable information with third parties for purposes of providing you with our products and services. These third parties may use your information to perform the services, and to offer you other products or services that may be of interest to you. Except as described herein, Anova will only provide information collected on the website to a third party if required to do so by law, or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with state and federal laws or respond to a court order, subpoena, or search warrant.

### SECURITY:

Anova takes security seriously. We use commercially standard methods to transmit your data securely including HTTPS, SSL, and 128bit encryption. The data is stored using Amazon’s S3 cloud service.

#### International Visitors:

Our website is hosted in the United States and is intended for United States and Canadian visitors. If you are accessing the site from the European Union or other regions with laws governing data collection and use that may differ from U.S. law, then please note that you are transferring your personal data to the United States and by providing your personal data you consent to that transfer.

#### Business Transitions:

Upon the sale or transfer of the company and its assets, we will require a purchaser to treat our data under the privacy statement in place at the time of its collection.

#### Changes to Privacy Policy:

Please note that this Privacy Policy may change from time to time. We will not reduce your rights under this Privacy Policy without your explicit consent. If we decide to change our privacy policy, then we will post those changes to this Privacy Notice, and other places we deem appropriate so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. We will also keep prior versions of this Privacy Policy in an archive for your review.
