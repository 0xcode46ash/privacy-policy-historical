# Disclaimer/Disclosure/Privacy Policy - An Ordinary Housewife

**Intellectual Content**

It is not my intent or desire to infringe on anyone else’s ideas or intellectual property, including blogs, other sites and non electronically published content. Any similarities between posts or other content on this site and that of another are coincidental and not intended to copy anyone else’s ideas without due credit. My posts, reviews, frugal finds, etc., are based on my own findings and experiences.

If I find information on another site or blog that I feel is so wonderful I _must_ share it, I will give due credit and include a link or other reference to the quoted source. It is my desire to conduct myself and my blog with the utmost integrity and I repeat, I will not knowingly copy someone else’s ideas, though some things posted _may_ bear some small similarity to something else you’ve seen or heard. Also, I ask anyone reading this blog to show me the same courtesy and not copy content from this site without crediting the source. Thank you.

**Advertisements**

**** Visitors to this site may encounter various advertisements, some of which I have little control over, except to remove if I find them unfit for or irrelevant to my site. To my knowledge, none of them are obscene, offensive or otherwise inappropriate. If anyone finds any advertisements on this site to be so, I ask you to notify me at once so appropriate action may be taken. ****

If any visitors to this site choose to click on any advertisements, they do so at their own risk. I cannot assume responsibility the actions of other sites. These sites may ask for personal information which you may choose to enter at your own risk. To my _knowledge_ there are no malicious links or spam-producing advertisers on this site, but I cannot guarantee this. I am obliged to provide this disclaimer. It is not my intent to “scare” anyone from exploring these advertisers, but I urge visitors to exercise caution when clicking on ads on _any_ site, not only this one. I truly hope my visitors will benefit from my advertisers, particularly links I have directly in my posts.
