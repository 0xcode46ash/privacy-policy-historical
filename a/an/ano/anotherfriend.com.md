# AnotherFriend.Com - Irelands Best Free Internet Dating and Personals Service for Irish Singles

At AnotherFriend.com we have created this privacy statement to demonstrate our commitment to protecting your privacy and to inform you about how we handle your personal information. 

This privacy statement only applies to transactions and activities in which you engage, and data gathered, on the AnotherFriend.com website but does not apply to any other web site or offline point of contact between AnotherFriend.com, or any other company, and consumers. Please review this privacy policy periodically as we may modify it from time to time. This privacy policy was last revised on May 16th, 2003. Each time you visit the Site or provide us with information, by doing so you are accepting the practices described in this privacy policy at that time. 

**Information we collect from you**

AnotherFriend.com only requests information that is necessary in order for us to fulfil our obligations to you and providing introductions to other interested members. We require visitors to the site to give us contact information (including their name and email address) and demographic information (like their age, occupation, height) to become a member. We then use this information to contact the visitor when necessary for support or to respond to members' emails. In this way, other members can only see the site name you have chosen. Thus, this is a private email system that allows you to communicate without having to give your email address to others. The personal profiles that are posted on this site are available to all the visitors 

We ask that you do not enter personal information or financial information into your "Profile" (for example, don't use your address as your user name, or include your name or address in your "About me" section), because if you do then it may be posted publicly on the Site, and the information will then be treated as "demographic information" that is "public information." 

The site has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. All data is stored on highly protected databases. 

**Your IP Address**  
Like most e-commerce websites, each time you visit the Site, we automatically collect your IP address and the web page from which you came. In order to administer and optimise the Site for you and to diagnose problems with our Site, we use your IP address to help identify you and to gather broad demographic information about you. 

**Does AnotherFriend.com monitor on-line behaviour?**

Our users communicate with each other through e-mail, chat, forum and SMS. While we do not, as a rule, moderate or monitor users private exchanges, we reserve the right to do so. User submissions that appear on the public area of the Site can be moderated and, if necessary, we reserve the right to edit, delete remove or not use any communication on a public area of the Site. 

**Correct/Update**  
You can change or update all your personal information (exclusive of your first and last name and e-mail address) online by logging in as a member, and clicking on 'Edit Profile' 

**Payment Security**  
All Credit Card numbers are secured as we use a third party to process your payment. No credit card details are stored on our servers. 

**Choice/Opt-Out**  
AnotherFriend.com regularly sends email to its members in order to inform them of new services, improvements, etc. Our members can opt-out of receiving communications from us by suspending their membership. This site gives users the following options for removing their information from our database to not receive future communications or to no longer receive our service. 1\. You can send email to [info@anotherfriend.com](mailto:info@anotherfriend.com) 2\. You can log onto your account and click on the deactivate account.
