# AnotherFriend.Com - Irelands free dating and Irish personals Service for Irish Singles

At AnotherFriend.com we have created this privacy statement to demonstrate our commitment to protecting your privacy and to inform you about how we handle your personal information. 

This privacy statement only applies to transactions and activities in which you engage, and data gathered, on the www.AnotherFriend.com website and any other partner website to whom we may link, but does not apply to any other web site or offline point of contact between AnotherFriend.com, or any other company, and consumers. 

This is a legal document which sets out how AnotherFriend.com handles data which identifies you. You should read it in conjunction with our Terms of Service, of which this Privacy Policy forms part. Please review this privacy policy periodically as we may modify it from time to time. Each time you visit the Site or provide us with information, by doing so you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Policy at that time by doing so you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Policy at that time. 

**Your IP Address**  
Like most e-commerce websites, each time you visit the Site, we automatically collect your IP address and the web page from which you came. In order to administer and optimise the Site for you and to diagnose problems with our Site, we use your IP address to help identify you and to gather broad demographic information about you. 

**Cookies**  
We use small files called 'cookies' to enhance the user experience of the AnotherFriend.com service and to track some site activities. If you wish to disable these cookies, the 'help' section of your browser will tell you how, but this will affect your access to some sections of the site as you will only be able to browse the site but will be unable to log on. 

**Information we collect from you**   
AnotherFriend.com only requests information that is necessary in order for us to fulfill our obligations to you and providing introductions to other interested members. We require visitors to the site to give us contact information (including their name and email address) and demographic information (like their age, occupation, height) to become a member. We then use this information to contact the visitor when necessary for support or to respond to members' emails. In this way, to protect your privacy, AnotherFriend.com acts as a gateway for all messages, so your email address is never revealed and other members can only see the site name you have chosen. Thus, this is a private email system that allows you to communicate without having to give your email address to others. The personal profiles that are posted on this site are available to all the visitors 

We ask that you do not enter personal information or financial information into your "Profile" (for example, don't use your address as your user name, or include your name or address in your "About me" section), because if you do then it may be posted publicly on the Site, and the information will then be treated as "demographic information" that is "public information." 

The site has security measures in place to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. All data is stored on highly protected databases, which is amongst the best software available today for secure software transactions. 

**Information other sites collect from you**  
On this website, we may place links to other websites operated by other parties. When you click on these links and visit other websites, regardless of whether or not they contain our brandname, or other references to us, you need to be aware that we do not control these websites or their businesses, and that this Privacy Policy does not apply to these websites. Hence they may collect other information from you and we encourage you to review their individual privacy policies. 

**How we use Information?**  
We use your e-mail information and other personal information to operate this site efficiently and to contact you in relation to your transaction, to forward messages to/from you to/from other members, and to inform you of what is happening on the site. These 'Direct Communications' to you may also contain commercial messages e.g. banner ads, promotional offers, etc. 'Direct Communications' are an obligatory part of the functioning of this website and receipt of these is a function of site membership. 

**Does AnotherFriend.com monitor on-line behaviour?**  
Our users communicate with each other through e-mail, chat and SMS. While we do not, as a rule, moderate or monitor users private exchanges, we reserve the right to do so. User submissions that appear on the public area of the Site can be moderated and, if necessary, we reserve the right to edit, delete/remove or not use any communication on a public area of the Site. 

**Correct/Update Your Information**  
You can change or update all your personal information online by logging in as a member, and clicking on 'Edit Profile' (this is exclusive of your e-mail address as you must notify us directly if you wish to change this). 

**Protect Yourself from SPAM**  
It is a good practice to refrain from disclosing your e-mail address or any other personal information in chat rooms, public forums or any other place unless it is properly protected. Information disclosed may be used by other persons for many purposes, including spamming.
