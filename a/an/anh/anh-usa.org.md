# Privacy Policy | Welcome to the Alliance for Natural Health - USA

**Privacy Policy**

* * *

 **We respect your privacy.**

The Alliance for Natural Health USA (ANH-USA) is committed to protecting the personal information that you entrust to us when using ANH-USA’s websites. This online privacy statement (the “Privacy Statement”) describes how we treat all user data collected by ANH-USA during your visit to www.anh-usa.org and its affiliated sites. It covers both technical data that is automatically collected and data that you voluntarily provide.

  *  **We do not rent, sell, or trade our member list to third parties.**
  * Email:
    *  **We only send email to those who have elected to receive it from us.** You may elect to receive email from ANH-USA when subscribing to our newsletter, making a donation, or signing a petition on our site or a partner website such as Care2.
    * You can opt-out of receiving some or all electronic communications by clicking the link to Unsubscribe at the end of any email, or by emailing office@anh-usa.org with the subject line, “Unsubscribe.”
  * Postal Mail:
    *  **We will only send you postal mail in reference to your membership.** Examples include but are not limited to thank-you letters, tax receipts, and renewal reminders. In an effort to reduce our environmental impact, we send as little postal mail as possible.
    *  **You will never receive advertising or promotional mail from ANH-USA.**



ANH-USA may occasionally update this Statement. We will post any changes on this web page, so be sure to check back periodically. If we do make material changes, we will post a notice on our home page that the Privacy Statement has been modified and provide a link to the revised Privacy Statement.

 **What User Data We Collect**

We collect two types of user data: (1) technical data that is automatically collected from all visitors to the ANH-USA Site (”Automatically Collected Data”); and (2) data that you voluntarily submit to us (described below under “Voluntarily Submitted Data”).

 ** _Automatically Collected Data:_**

We automatically collect Internet Protocol (”IP”) addresses and domain names of the originating visitor’s computer on our server and may have some information you have previously provided through cookies. (See the section on Cookies below for more information.)

We also track the number and frequency of hits per page by IP addresses, but we do not associate any individual IP address with any other personal identifying information except to detect security intrusions or certain unlawful activity.

In addition, if you come to an ANH-USA website from a hyperlink (email or website), we may also identify the source of that link.

 _ **Voluntarily Submitted Data:**_

 _ ****_We may collect Voluntarily Submitted Data, including personal data, that you provide, including your name and postal address, phone number, e-mail address, and similar information. For example when you:

  * join or renew your membership to ANH-USA;
  * make an additional contribution to support ANH-USA;
  * sign up for our e-mail network;
  * send correspondence to your government representative, to a friend or to other targeted representatives through the ANH-USA Site;
  * participate in one of our online petitions or surveys; or
  * participate in any activity that requires your Voluntarily Submitted Data.



 **How We Use the Data We Collect**

 _ **Automatically Collected Data:**_

In addition to the uses described above, we use Automatically Collected Data to identify the source of user traffic (i.e., aol.com), but we do not tie this information to individual users in our database.

We use data on which sections of the ANH-USA site are most visited, so that we can evaluate the popularity of our different web pages and continue to improve the ANH-USA Site.

We do not link any Automatically Collected Data to the Voluntarily Submitted Data you provide to us except to detect security intrusions or certain unlawful activity.

 ** _Voluntarily Submitted Data:_**

We use Voluntarily Submitted Data in a number of ways, depending on how and why you provided your data to us. These uses include:

  * To fulfill the request for which you specifically provided the data, including sharing the data with its intended recipient (e.g., delivering a petition you sign or a letter you wish to send to the recipient of the petition or letter);
  * To periodically communicate with you concerning natural health matters, such as delivering to you information and updates on our activities and action alerts, if you have not opted out of receiving such information and updates;
  * To indicate you as the author of any comment you post, including on any ANH-USA blog, when you opt to identify yourself as the author or when posting such comment requires such identification, and to display any information you voluntarily include in such comments.
  * To allow you to set and change user preferences;
  * To allow you to renew your membership with ANH-USA;
  * To offer you other ways to support ANH-USA, including solicitations for additional contributions if you have not opted out of receiving such communications;
  * To confirm your contributions to ANH-USA;
  * To confirm your registration to an ANH-USA event;
  * To follow up with you with an email specific to an activity you have participated in or intend to participate in.



The ANH-USA Sites are hosted by servers in the United States. Accordingly, if you are located outside of the United States, the Voluntarily Submitted Data you provide to us will be transferred to the United States. By submitting your Voluntarily Submitted Data, you consent to its transfer and storage in the United States and its use in accordance with the purposes for which it was originally collected (see below regarding third-party sharing of Voluntarily Submitted Data from non-U.S. residents).

If you are a U.S. resident, we may also from time to time combine your Voluntarily Submitted Data with some publicly available data collected from third parties to improve our services to you and for our own internal marketing, communications, and fundraising purposes.
