# Privacy Policy | Welcome to the Alliance for Natural Health - USA

**Privacy Policy**

* * *

**We respect your privacy.**

This privacy statement was created in order to demonstrate our commitment to you, our supporter. This statement discloses the privacy practices for this site.

We do not rent or sell our Member list to 3rd parties.

We only send email to those who have elected to receive it from us.

You can opt-out of receiving electronic communications by clicking the opt-out button (or sending an email with the subject: unsubscribe) at any time.

The American Association for Health Freedom (ANH-USA) is committed to protecting health freedom. We are also committed to protecting the personal information that you entrust to us when using ANH-USA’s websites. This online privacy statement (the “Privacy Statement”) describes how we treat all user data collected by ANH-USA during your visit to the reformFDA.org website or www.anh-usa.org. It covers both technical data that is automatically collected and data that you voluntarily provide.

ANH-USA may occasionally update this Statement. We will post any changes on this web page, so be sure to check back periodically. If we do make material changes, we will post a notice on our home page that the Privacy Statement has been modified and provide a link to the revised Privacy Statement.

**User Data We Collect**

We collect two types of user data: (1) technical data that is automatically collected from all visitors to the ANH-USA Site (”Automatically Collected Data”); and (2) data that you voluntarily submit to us (described below under “Voluntarily Submitted Data”).

Automatically Collected Data. We automatically collect Internet Protocol (”IP”) addresses and domain names of the originating visitor’s computer on our server and may have some information you have previously provided through cookies. (See the section on Cookies below for more information.) We also track the number and frequency of hits per page by IP addresses, but we do not associate any individual IP address with any other personal identifying information except to detect security intrusions or certain unlawful activity.

In addition, if you come to an ANH-USA website from a hyperlink (email or website), we may also identify the source of that link.

Voluntarily Submitted Data. We may collect Voluntarily Submitted Data, including personal data, that you provide, including your name and postal address, phone number, e-mail address, and similar information. For example when you:

join or renew your membership to ANH-USA;

make an additional contribution to support ANH-USA;

sign up for our e-mail network;

send correspondence to your government representative, to a friend or to other targeted representatives through the ANH-USA Site;

participate in one of our online petitions or surveys; or

participate in any activity that requires your Voluntarily Submitted Data.

**How We Use the Data We Collect**

In addition to the uses described above, we use Automatically Collected Data to identify the source of user traffic (i.e., aol.com), but we do not tie this information to individual users in our database. We use data on which sections of the ANH-USA site are most visited, so that we can evaluate the popularity of our different web pages and continue to improve the ANH-USA Site. We do not link any Automatically Collected Data with the Voluntarily Submitted Data you provide to us except to detect security intrusions or certain unlawful activity.

**We use your Voluntarily Submitted Data for various purposes:**

To fulfill the request for which you specifically provided the data, including sharing the data with its intended recipient (e.g., delivering a petition you sign or a letter you wish to send to the recipient of the petition or letter);

To periodically communicate with you concerning health freedom matters, such as delivering to you information and updates on our activities and action alerts, if you have not opted out of receiving such information and updates;

To indicate you as the author of any comment you post, including on any ANH-USA Site blog or forum, when you opt to identify yourself as the author or when posting such comment requires such identification, and to display any personally identifying or other information you voluntarily include in such comments.

To personalize the content that you see based on the activities and products that you have selected on the ANH-USA Site;

To allow you to set and change user preferences;

To allow you to renew your membership in the ANH-USA;

To offer you other ways to support the ANH-USA, including solicitations for additional contributions if you have not opted out of receiving such communications;

To confirm your contribution to ANH-USA;

To confirm your registration to an ANH-USA event;

To follow up with you with an email specific to an activity you have participated in or intend to participate in.

If your Voluntarily Submitted Data includes a U.S. zip code or state and you are a member, donor or subscriber to ANH-USA information, we may also share your Voluntarily Submitted Data with our state chapter if you have checked that you want to support our state efforts and have given us permission to do so. They may use that information to:

Periodically communicate with you concerning local chapter matters, such as delivering information and updates on the chapter’s activities, action alerts concerning local matters and invitations to local events, if you have not opted out of receiving that information;

Confirm your registration to an event;

Follow up with you with an email specific to an activity you have participated in or intend to participate in; and

Offer you other ways to support ANH-USA and chapter, including solicitations for additional contributions, if you have not opted out of receiving such communications.

The ANH-USA Sites are hosted by servers in the United States. Accordingly, if you are located outside of the United States, the Voluntarily Submitted Data you provide to us will be transferred to the United States. By submitting your Voluntarily Submitted Data, you consent to its transfer and storage in the United States and its use in accordance with the purposes for which it was originally collected (see below regarding third-party sharing of Voluntarily Submitted Data from non-U.S. residents).

If you are a U.S. resident, we may also from time to time combine your Voluntarily Submitted Data with some publicly available data collected from third parties to improve our services to you and for our own internal marketing, communications, and fundraising purposes.
