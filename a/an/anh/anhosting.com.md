## Information Collection and Use

### Orders

If you purchase a product or service from us, we request certain personally identifiable information from you on our order form. You must provide contact information (such as name, email, and mailing address) and financial information (such as credit card number, CVV, expiration date). 

We use this information for billing purposes and to fill your orders. If we have trouble processing an order, we will use this information to contact you.

After you register, you should receive a confirmation email which will show that the order was received, a welcome email with your username and password, and an email with a receipt for the transaction. 

### Customer Testimonials

We post customer testimonials/comments/reviews on our web site which may contain personally identifiable information. We do obtain the customer's consent via email prior to posting the testimonial to post their name along with their testimonial.

### Customer Service

We will communicate with you in response to your inquiries, to provide the services you request, and to manage your account. We will communicate with you by email or telephone, in accordance with your wishes.

### Surveys or Contests

From time-to-time we may provide you the opportunity to participate in contests or surveys. If you choose participate, we may request certain personally identifiable information from you. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this information. The requested information may include contact information, demographic information, and personal preferences.

We use this information to improve our website, services and user experience, as well as communicate with contest participants.

We may use a third party service provider to conduct these surveys or contests; that provider is prohibited from using our users' personally identifiable information for any other purpose. 

### Uses of Information

The forms found on our website are used to gather contact information (such as name, email address, billing information, and phone number) of users to process orders, respond to questions and requests. If you need to change your personal account information, you may update it by making the change in your account. 

We keep records of our user interaction and support provided (via chat, phone, and email) to track account history and better assist our users.

## Tracking Technologies

### Log Files

As is true of most Web sites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. 

### Cookies

A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user's computer for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies on this site. We do not link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our site. 

We use session ID cookies. We use session cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our site. A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser 

If you reject cookies, you may still use our site, but your ability to use some areas of our site, such as our shopping cart will be limited. 

### Clear Gifs 

We employ a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers' personally identifiable information. 

We may also use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns. If you would like to opt-out of these emails, please click the "unsubscribe" link in the email footer. 

We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users' movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We do not link this automatically-collected data to personally identifiable information. 

We use the following third-party tracking services: Google Analytics, DirectTrack, which use cookies and web beacons to track non-personally identifiable information about visitors to our site in the aggregate of IP addresses to track marketing efforts and affiliate sales. We have no access or control of these third party tracking technologies.

### Email Correspondence 

AN Hosting will use your name and email address to send newsletter to you. These newsletters include information on promotions, services, and company information. Out of respect for your privacy, we provide you a way to unsubscribe in each promotional email. 

We will send you strictly service-related announcements on occasion when it is necessary to do so; for example, if there is network maintenance you will receive an email. You may opt-out of these communications by clicking the unsubscribe link provided.

### Choice/Opt-out

If you don't want to receive our newsletter and promotional communications, you may opt-out of receiving them by following the instructions included in each newsletter or communication or by emailing us at [sales@anhosting.com](mailto:sales@anhosting.com).

### Third Party Sharing 

We will share your personal information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this privacy statement. We do not sell your personal information to third parties except as described in this privacy statement (see "Business Transitions"). We may also disclose your personal information: as required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena, or similar legal process; when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request; to any other third party with your prior consent to do so. 

### Advertising 

We partner with a third party ad network to manage our advertising on other sites. Our ad network partner uses cookies and Web beacons to collect non-personally identifiable information about your activities on this and other Web sites to provide you targeted advertising based upon your interests, search history, and web browser history. If you wish to not have this information used for the purpose of serving you targeted ads, you may opt-out by [clicking here](http://preferences.truste.com/). Please note this does not opt you out of being served advertising. You will continue to receive generic ads. 

[NAI opt-out](http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp)

### Co-branded sites

Our privacy statement does apply to the information collected on these co-branded sites. You should read the privacy statement of our co-branded partner.

### Security

The security of your personal information is important to us. We use the highest standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. When you enter sensitive information (such as a credit card number) on our order forms, we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).

### Data Retention

We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services. If you wish to cancel your account or request that we no longer use your information to provide you services contact us at [billing@anhosting.com](mailto:billing@anhosting.com). We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. 

### Business Transitions

In the event AN Hosting goes through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, your personally identifiable information will likely be among the assets transferred. 

### Access to Personally Identifiable Information

If your personally identifiable information changes, or if you no longer desire our service, you may correct, update, or delete it by making the change on our profile page or by emailing [billing@anhosting.com](mailto:billing@anhosting.com) or by contacting us by phone or postal mail at the contact information listed below. We will respond to all requests for access within 30 days.
