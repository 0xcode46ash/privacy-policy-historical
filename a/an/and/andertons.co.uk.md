# Privacy Policy - Andertons Music Co.

**2\. How do we use cookies?**

**2.1** Shopping Cart: When you add multiple items to your cart, a cookie is used to remember all the items that are in your cart. This cookie is stored for a short period of time, in case you want to return to our site later that day to complete your purchase(s).

**2.2** Recommendations: A cookie is used to recommend a range of products that might be relevant to your interests, based on the content you've viewed on our site.

**2.3** Customer Login: When you log in to our website, we set a cookie that keeps you logged on, so you can check out from our website without having to enter your password more than once. This cookie is short-term and will be remembered for around 24 hours.

**2.4** Payment Providers: If you wish to pay using Paypal or Instant Finance, cookies are required to retain your order details when you leave the Andertons Music Co. website, to process your payment on Paypal or our Instant Finance provider.

**2.5** Analytics: We use cloud-based services called Google Analytics and IBM Tealeaf to provide insight into how customers use our website. For example, we can see what the most visited products are, identify website technical issues, or find out if anyone read our latest blog! The information includes behavioural data like pages users viewed, buttons/links that users clicked, and key actions that users take throughout the online browsing and ordering process. We use this information to improve our customer experience, like showing you our most popular gear, improving the speed of the website and providing content you want to read.

Please Note: These cookies store no personal information about you and your personal browsing activity is anonymised, so users cannot be monitored individually. Analytics cookies can be stored for up to 30 days. This allows us to see how many users have returned to the site after an initial visit.

**2.6** Facebook Modules: The embedded Facebook comments and Facebook Like buttons use cookies, set by Facebook, to determine whether you are currently logged into Facebook or not. These cookies are not used to collect data. We do not have access to this cookie data. Both of these services are hosted by Facebook on facebook.com.

We also use Facebook Pixel. This involves a cookie which allows us serve adverts based on your browsing and purchasing behaviour on facebook.com. Your personal data is not shared in anyway, and the information is anonymised, so we cannot track your individual behaviour.

**2.7** Bing and Google Shopping Cookies: When you perform a search on Bing and/or Google, you are eligible to see product shopping ads. Should you click a product advert from a search engine, including image search, they will store a cookie on your machine. This helps us understand how many people saw or clicked an advert from Andertons.
