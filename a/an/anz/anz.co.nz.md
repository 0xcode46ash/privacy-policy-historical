### Acceptance and Changes to Security and Privacy Statement

You acknowledge and accept that your use of the ANZ website indicates your acceptance of the ANZ website Terms of Use and the Security and Privacy Statement.

ANZ may at any time vary the Security and Privacy Statement by publishing the varied Security and Privacy Statement on the ANZ website. You accept that by doing this, ANZ has provided you with sufficient notice of the variation.

### Security of information

ANZ takes reasonable steps to preserve the security of cookie and personal information in accordance with the ANZ website Terms of Use and this Security and Privacy Statement. If your browser is suitably configured, it will advise you whether the information you are sending us will be secure (encrypted) or not secure (unencrypted). If secure transmission is indicated, ANZ currently uses 128 bit SSL encryption.

ANZ regularly reviews developments in security and encryption technologies. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed as totally secure. Accordingly, although ANZ strives to protect such information, ANZ cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or from our online products or services and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission, we take reasonable steps to preserve the security of the information in our own systems.

### Information collected

The information that ANZ collects about you is dependent on how you use the facilities offered by the ANZ website.

If you visit an unsecure area of the ANZ website (that is, an area where you are not required to log on) to read, browse or download information, our system will record the date and time of your visit to our site, the pages viewed and any information downloaded. However, our systems will not record any personally identifiable information.

The ANZ website may offer a number of interactive facilities including tools such as budget planners and home loan calculators, as well as online surveys and application forms.

If you use any of the tools such as the budget planner or home loan calculator we generally do not capture any personal information that you may enter when using these tools. An exception to this is when a tool such as a budget planner allows you to suspend or save your plan and retrieve the details at a later time. In that case the information is stored on our systems so that you may recover the information when you resume your plan. Any information stored in a suspended or saved budget planner or other similar tool will not be viewed by ANZ.

If you decide to complete an online application form or online survey, the information that you enter into the online form or survey will only be collected by ANZ if you submit your online application or survey. If at any stage you cancel your application or log out prior to submitting your application or survey, the information you have entered up to that point will be automatically deleted. You can suspend and save online applications. If you suspend or save your application, for example because you wish to complete it at another time, the information that you have entered will be retained in our systems so that you may recover the information when you resume your application. You may only recover this information within 30 days. After this time, the information is deleted. Online applications that have been suspended or saved will not be viewed by us and are not processed by us.

ANZ uses Liveperson Inc. to deliver its live chat facility. If you decide to participate in a live chat, Liveperson Inc., on behalf of ANZ, collects, stores, uses and discloses any personal information that you provide for quality assurance purposes and to allow ANZ to follow up with your inquiry. Liveperson Inc. is required under its arrangements with ANZ to maintain the privacy and confidentiality of that personal information.  

The ANZ website may also contain links to the websites of third party providers of goods and services ("Third Party websites"). If you have accessed Third Party websites through the ANZ website and if those third parties collect information about you, ANZ may also collect or have access to that information as part of our arrangements with those third parties.

Where you access a Third Party website from the ANZ website, cookie information, information about your preferences or other information you have provided about yourself may be shared between us and the third party. You cannot usually be identified from the information that is shared; if you can be identified from this information, we will seek your consent before sharing such information.

Third Party websites should contain their own privacy statements and those third parties are responsible for their own privacy practices.

### Cookies

We use "cookies" as a fundamental part of our interaction with your Internet browser. The purpose is to provide you with better and more customised service and a more effective website. A cookie is a small text file that can be stored on your computer, tablet or phone when you visit a website. A web server sends you a cookie and your browser accepts it. The browser then returns the cookie to the web server next time you visit that particular website. You can choose if and how a cookie will be accepted by configuring your preferences and options in your browser.

Please note that if your browser is configured to reject all cookies you will be unable to use secure services on the ANZ website that require cookies in order to participate. Those services may include online applications and surveys. You may still be able to use some information-only pages even if you do not accept cookies.

### Tracking and Advertising

ANZ works with a number of Advertising and Tracking Companies (such as MediaMind, DoubleClick and Datalicious) to deliver advertising on Third Party websites and monitor performance of ANZ advertising and associated ANZ websites.

The Advertising and Tracking Companies use cookies to collect information such as:

  * The device/browser type you are using
  * The date and time of your visit
  * The advertising you see
  * How you use ANZ websites



  
When you access the ANZ website after viewing an ANZ advertisement on a Third Party website, the Advertising Company collects information on how you utilise the ANZ website, such as which web pages you view or whether you complete an online application.

The Advertising and Tracking Companies use this information to perform statistical analyses of aggregate user behaviour, but those analyses are not based on personal information. ANZ uses these analyses to track ANZ website and marketing performance and to offer more relevant advertising and content on ANZ websites and Third Party websites. ANZ may disclose this information in an aggregate (not personal) form only, to third parties including advertisers or potential advertisers.
