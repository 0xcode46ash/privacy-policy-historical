### Security and Confidentiality Note

The Annual Credit Report Request Service recognizes the importance of secure online transactions, and takes steps to safeguard the privacy of information you provide through online forms. When you request free credit reports online, programs encrypt the information you provide on the request form before transmitting it to the selected nationwide consumer credit reporting company(ies).

  * To allow us to gather aggregated statistical data about the use of this website for management and development purposes; and

These cookies will only collect information during your online activity at this website, not during any of your other Internet activity. Cookies set by us cannot be interpreted by any other third party without your explicit consent. We may sometimes use outside technology companies to set cookies on this website and collect cookie information for us. The cookie information collected by these companies is used in the same manner as stated above in this section. Those companies may not use these cookies for their own internal purposes or share the information collected with any party other than Central Source and the three nationwide consumer credit reporting companies and their contractors. 

**How can I accept cookies?**

You can decide if and how your computer will accept a cookie by establishing your preferences in your web browser.
