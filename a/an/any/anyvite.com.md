# Privacy Policy

It is Anyvite's policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our website. 

  


##  Website Visitors

Like most website operators, Anyvite collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Anyvite's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Anyvite's visitors use its website. From time to time, Anyvite may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.

Anyvite also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. Anyvite does not use such information to identify its visitors, however, and does not disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information, as described below. 

  


## Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information

Certain visitors to Anyvite's websites choose to interact with Anyvite in ways that require Anyvite to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Anyvite gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who register and login at Anyvite to provide a valid email address. Those who engage in transactions with Anyvite - by registering, for example - are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, Anyvite collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor's interaction with Anyvite. Anyvite does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.

  


##  Aggregated Statistics 

Anyvite may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. For instance, Anyvite may monitor the most popular parts of the Anyvite site, and log page views. Anyvite may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, Anyvite does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.

  


## Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information

Anyvite discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Anyvite's behalf or to provide services available at Anyvite's websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Anyvite's websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Anyvite will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Anyvite discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only when required to do so by law, or when Anyvite believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Anyvite, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of a Anyvite website and have supplied your email address, Anyvite may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what's going on with Anyvite and our products. We primarily use our blog to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Anyvite takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.

  


##  Cookies

A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor's computer, and that the visitor's browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Anyvite uses cookies to help Anyvite identify and track visitors, their usage of Anyvite website, and their website access preferences. Anyvite visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using Anyvite's websites, with the drawback that certain features of Anyvite's websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.

  


##  Privacy Policy Changes 

Although most changes are likely to be minor, Anyvite may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in Anyvite's sole discretion. Anyvite encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.
