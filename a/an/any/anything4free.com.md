### Privacy Policy

Anything 4 Free is committed to maintaining your confidence and trust, and accordingly maintains the following privacy policy to protect personal information you provide online.

####  **Third Party Advertising**

We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our Web site. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements on this site and other sites about goods and services that may be of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, please click [here](http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp).

####  **Third Party Cookies**

In the course of serving advertisements to this site, our third-party advertiser may place or recognize a unique "cookie" on your browser.

####  **No Computer Tracking of Identifiable Information**

Our server is not set up to track, collect or distribute personal information about its visitors. It does recognize the home server of visitors, but not e-mail addresses. For example, we can tell which Internet Service Provider our visitors use, but not the names, addresses or other information about our visitors that would allow us to identify the particular visitors to our sites. This information is used only for internal purposes by Anything4Free.

In addition, our website tracks information about the visits to our website. For example, we compile statistics that show the daily number of visitors to our sites, the daily requests we receive for particular files on our web sites, and what countries those requests come from. These aggregated statistics are used internally to better provide services to the public and may also be provided to others, but again, the statistics contain no personal information and cannot be used to gather such information.

####  **We hate spam too.**

We will never sell or distribute any of your personally identifiable information unless it must be released in compliance with the law.

**Anything4Free is not responsible for the privacy practices or policies of any affiliates or 3rd party organizations displayed within our website.**

####  **How To Contact Us**

If you have any further questions, please send an email to [admin@anything4free.com](mailto:admin@anything4free.com)
