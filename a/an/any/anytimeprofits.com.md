**Privacy Policy**

Use of the **Success Ventures** website: We respect your privacy. Below is an outline of what information this site gathers and how it's used:

Whenever your request a page, your IP address, browser and version, operating system and the site you came from are stored in a log file. This information cannot be used to identify a specific individual. This information is only used for statistical purposes to help improve this site and provide accurate statistics to help us understand site usage.

Any email addresses collected on this site are not sold, or disclosed to a third party. The email addresses collected will only be used to send you information from us.

**Cookies**

In common with many other online services, we will use "cookies" to store and sometimes to track information about you. A cookie is a small amount of data sent from the server which is stored on your PC's hard drive. You can ask your browser to show you where the cookie has been set up and, if you wish, you may also set your browser to refuse cookies. Some of the services which we provide, however, depend on the presence of a cookie and, if you choose to reject our cookie, certain online features may not be available to you. We use the information collected in this way to help us review, develop and improve the service which we offer to you.

**Orders**

We request information from the user on our order form. Here a user must provide contact information (like name and shipping address) and financial information (like credit card number, expiration date). This information is used for billing purposes and to fill customer's orders. If we have trouble processing an order, this contact information is used to get in touch with the user.

**Log Files**

We use IP addresses to analyse trends, administer the site, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information.

**Sharing**

We may share aggregated demographic information with our partners and advertisers. This is not linked to any personal information that can identify any individual person.

We use a credit card processing company to bill users for goods and services. These companies do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes.

**Security**

This website takes every precaution to protect our users' information. When users submit sensitive information via the website, your information is protected both online and off-line.

When our registration/order form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number and/or social security number), that information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry - SSL. While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when you are just 'surfing'.

While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect user-information off-line. All of our users' information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information.

**Links**

This web site may contain links to other sites. Please be aware that we [Success Ventures] are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this Web site.

**Correction/Updating Personal Information**

If a user's personally identifiable information changes (such as your post code), or if a user no longer desires our service, we will endeavor to provide a way to correct, update or remove that user's personal data provided to us. This can be done by contacting our Admin Department.

**Notification of Changes**

If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on our Home page so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If at any point we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify users by way of an email. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected.

**Opt-Out**

If you use this site to purchase goods or services you may occasionally receive information on products, services, special deals, and a newsletter. Out of respect for the privacy of our users we present the option to not receive these types of communications on our order form.

Users who no longer wish to receive our newsletter or promotional materials from our partners may opt-out of receiving these communications by replying to unsubscribe in the subject line in the email or email us at [](mailto:).

Users of our site are always notified when their information is being collected by any outside parties. We do this so our users can make an informed choice as to whether they should proceed with services that require an outside party, or not.
