With respect to cookies: We use cookies to customize Web page content based on visitors' browser type or other information that the visitor sends. 

We require our members to provide an email address (account email) of a type considered valid by us. We will not provide the account email address you provide to any third party except where required by law. Our use of the account email will be limited solely to AWC-generated password confirmations, reminders or other site-related information. 

You may optionally also wish to provide an email address that enables the "blind-email" feature of our site where you can anonymously share emails from other members. From time to time, we make these optional e-mail addresses available to other reputable organizations whose products or services we think you might find interesting.

As a result of your visit to our site, ad server companies may collect information such as your domain type, your IP address and clickstream information.

From time to time, we may use customer information for new, unanticipated uses not previously disclosed in our privacy notice. If our information practices change at some time in the future we will post the policy changes to our Web site to notify you of these changes and provide you with the ability to opt out of these new uses. If you are concerned about how your information is used, you should check back at our Web site periodically. 

Upon request we provide site visitors with access to unique identifier information (e.g., customer number or password) that we maintain about them, contact information (e.g., name, address, phone number) that we maintain about them, a description of information that we maintain about them. Consumers can access this information by visiting their Membership Profile. Consumers can have this information corrected by amending their Membership Profile.
