After compidivng these tracking information reports, we may then provide these reports to our vendors and other third parties. None of the tracking information in these reports can be connected to the identities of individual Users.

Pursuant to the terms of this Policy, we may use your Personal Information for a number of different commercial purposes, including the following (without limitation):

  * Provide access to the Service and verify your eligibility for the Service;

Vendors

We may share aggregate data regarding the use of our Service by you and others with our third party vendors that provide discounts and offers through our Service. This information is intended to serve as a high-level overview of our Users' collective activities on our Service, and allows our vendors to modify their discounts and other offers based on such activity and user traffic. In some cases, we may provide periodic reports to our vendors pertaining to Users’ activities on our Service, page impressions, click-rates, and other similar metrics. Additionally, in some cases, we may share Personal Information about you with our vendors, such as your name and email address, for purposes of facilitating your purchase or redemption of certain perks or discounts offered through the Service.

Service Providers

We may use third-party service providers (i.e., for our web hosting, data management, network, hardware, software, storage, and/or payment processing needs) to manage one of more aspects of our business operations, including the processing or handling of Personal Information. When we do use an outside company, we use contractual or other appropriate means to ensure that Personal Information is used in a manner that is consistent with this Policy. By registering for the Service and providing your credit or debit card details to us, you permit us to use your provided credit or debit card information to bill you for the Service subscription you purchase. Additionally, by providing your credit card details to us, you consent to and authorize us to provide your credit card details to payment processors and financial institutions necessary to process your payment for the Service. To provide increased availability of our website and/or Service, some of these operations may potentially result in Personal Information collected by us being stored in other countries outside the U.S., and as a result, such Personal Information may be accessible to law enforcement and regulatory authorities in accordance with applicable laws of such countries outside of the U.S.

Information Shared Amongst Our Affiliates, Subsidiaries and Divisions

We may share Personal Information gathered through our Service with and amongst our corporate subsidiaries, affiliates or divisions for internal business purposes in accordance with this Policy. We may also transfer Personal Information if AnyPerk is acquired by or merged with another company. In this event, we will notify you before Personal Information is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy, and will ensure that such Personal Information continues to be used only in accordance with this Policy and your expressed choices.

Legal Disclosure and Compliance with Laws

We may disclose your Personal Information as permitted or required by law without your consent, if we are compelled to release information by a court of law or other person or entity with jurisdiction to compel production of such information (e.g., subpoenas). Additionally, if we have reasonable grounds to believe information could be useful in the investigation or prevention of improper or unlawful activity (i.e., suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of our Terms of Service), we may disclose information voluntarily to law enforcement agencies or other appropriate investigative bodies without obtaining your consent before doing so.

AnyPerk uses third party vendors and hosting partners to provide the necessary hardware, software, networking, storage, and related technology required to run our services. Although AnyPerk owns the code, databases, and all rights to the AnyPerk applications, you retain all rights to your data.

Our Service enables Users to obtain discounts and other perks from third party vendors and otherwise contains links to third-party websites or Internet resources which are provided solely for your convenience and information. When you click on one of those links you are contacting another website or Internet resource. You understand that this Policy does not extend or apply to any such third party website or Internet resource that you may visit or be redirected to through our Service. We have no control over, or responsibility or liability for, those other websites or Internet resources or their collection, use and disclosure of your Personal Information. We encourage you to read the privacy policies of those other websites to learn how they collect and use your Personal Information. 

AnyPerk endeavors to safeguard Personal Information to ensure that such information is kept private. However, we cannot guarantee the security of your Personal Information. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, the inherent insecurity of the Internet and other factors, may compromise the security of your Personal Information at any time. You can take steps to protect your Personal Information by protecting your log-in information and password. 

If you are located outside of the United States, please note that the Service is hosted in the United States. Therefore, your information may be processed and stored in the United States. As a result, United States federal and state governments, courts, or law enforcement or regulatory agencies may be able to obtain disclosure of your information through laws applicable in the United States. Your use of this Service or your submission of any Personal Information to us will constitute your consent to the transfer of your Personal Information outside of your home country, including the United States, which may provide for different data protection rules than in your country. 

The Service is not intended for use by minors under the age of 13 and we do not knowingly solicit any information from or market to such minors. If you are a parent or legal guardian who discovers that your child has provided us with information without your consent, you may contact us at [privacy@anyperk.com](mailto:privacy@anyperk.com). We will delete such information from our files. 

We may periodically update this Policy at our sole discretion. We will notify you about significant changes in the way we treat Personal Information by sending a notice to the primary e-mail address registered in your AnyPerk account and/or by placing a prominent notice on our website. Please ensure that your primary e-mail address on file with us is correct. You retain the right to access, amend, correct or delete your Personal Information where it is inaccurate at any time. To do so, please contact us by e-mail at [privacy@anyperk.com](mailto:privacy@anyperk.com). We encourage you to check this Policy whenever you use our Service to understand how your Personal Information is being used. Please remember that if you object to any of the changes to our Policy terms at any given time and/or you no longer wish to use our Service, you may close your account and discontinue any and all use of our Service. 

We may send you communications regarding our Service, including (without limitation): (a) notices about your use of our Service (including any notices regarding violations of such use), (b) updates to our Service, and (c) promotional information and materials related to our Service. You may opt-out of receiving these promotional e-mails and other promotional communications from us at any time by e-mailing [privacy@anyperk.com](mailto:privacy@anyperk.com) with your specific request.
