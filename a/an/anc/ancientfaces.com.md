# Your Privacy is Important | AncientFaces Privacy Policy

AncientFaces knows that you care about the information you share. We appreciate and value your trust. This Privacy Policy describes how we treat your information. By visiting AncientFaces you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Policy 

##  What Personal Information about visitors does AncientFaces gather? 

### Information You Give Us:

We collect personal information such as your name, email address, and other basic information to provide you with an enhanced experience at AncientFaces. Your information is used to customize and improve your visits. Registered members enter basic information about themselves to gain the ability to create member profiles, edit email subscriptions, change any of the material they have added to AncientFaces, and communicate with other members. We may also collect various pieces of visitor information to track the use of our web site. This information might include the visitor's domain name or IP address, and the visitor's browser and platform type. All collected information is kept strictly secure and private and is never shared. 

### Use of cookies:

AncientFaces uses cookies for registered member sessions. The information is erased once you leave the site. When you sign in to your profile as a registered member, a cookie is activated to let our web site know that you are logged in. This enables your membership functions. Without cookies, we wouldn't be able to tell if you were signed in or not. 

###  Does AncientFaces Share the Information it receives? 

AncientFaces never shares any of our visitors' personal information. However, please be aware that when you post information to AncientFaces certain information is made available online so that visitors who are interested in your material can contact you to discuss your submission. 

###  How Secure Is Information About Me? 

AncientFaces is dedicated to protecting your personal information. AncientFaces uses Secure-Socket Layer (SSL) encryption to keep your personal information safe. SSL is an Internet Protocol, which allows for the secure transfer of data. Rather than transferring data between a number of carriers, SSL creates a secure connection between the client (you) and the host (AncientFaces). To ensure your personal information is safe, we employ several other methods of security. 

###  What Information Can I Access? 

AncientFaces gives you access to certain information about you for the limited purpose of viewing and, in certain cases, updating that information. You can find this information in 'Your Profile' if you are a member. 

###  Conditions of Use, Notices, and Revisions. 

If you choose to visit AncientFaces, your visit and any disputes over privacy is subject to this Privacy Policy and our Terms and Conditions of use, including limitations on damages, arbitration of disputes, and application of the law of the state of California. If you have any concern about privacy at AncientFaces, please submit a request at our [Contact Us](https://web.archive.org/content/contact) page. Our business changes constantly and this policy along with the Terms and Conditions of use will also change.
