# Your Privacy is Important | AncientFaces Privacy Policy

AncientFaces knows that you care about the information you share. We appreciate and value your trust. This Privacy Policy describes how we treat your information. 

**By visiting AncientFaces you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Policy.**

## What Personal Information about Visitors does AncientFaces gather?

### Information You Give Us:

We collect personal information to provide you with an enhanced experience at AncientFaces. Your information is used to customize and improve your visits. Registered users enter basic information about themselves to gain the ability to create user profiles, edit email subscriptions, change any of the material they have added to AncientFaces, and sell in the Marketplace. Under some circumstances we may require additional financial information, such as, but not limited to, if you are registering to sell in the Marketplace. We use your financial information, including credit card information to verify your name, address, and other information, as well as to bill you for use of our services. You may also choose to receive payments via Direct Deposit into your checking account. Basic checking information is needed to credit your account. This information is kept strictly secure and private. We may also collect various pieces of visitor information to track the use of our web site. This information might include the visitor's domain name or IP address, and the visitor's browser and platform type. 

### Use of cookies:

AncientFaces uses cookies for registered user sessions. The information is erased once you leave the site. When you sign in as a Registered User, a cookie is activated to let our web site know that you are registered. This enables your user functions. Without cookies, we wouldn't be able to tell if you were signed in or not. 

AncientFaces never shares any of our visitors' personal information. However, we do post basic contact information of those that upload material on AncientFaces. This information is made available so visitors who are interested in your material can contact you to gain more information. 

### How Secure Is Information About Me?

AncientFaces is dedicated to protecting your personal information. AncientFaces uses Secure-Socket Layer (SSL) encryption powered by VeriSign to keep your personal information safe. SSL is an Internet Protocol, which allows for the secure transfer of data. Rather than transferring data between a number of carriers, SSL creates a secure connection between the client (you) and the host (AncientFaces). To ensure your personal information is safe, such as credit card and banking information, we employ SSL as well as several other methods of security. We also validate your credit card information before it is sent for processing so that we can prevent the need for multiple transmissions, and thus prevent the chance that your data is put at risk. 

### What Information Can I Access?

AncientFaces gives you access to certain information about you for the limited purpose of viewing and, in certain cases, updating that information. You can find this information in 'Your Account' if you are a Registered user or Seller. Conditions of Use, Notices, and Revisions If you choose to visit AncientFaces, your visit and any disputes over privacy is subject to this Privacy Policy and our Conditions of Use, including limitations on damages, arbitration of disputes, and application of the law of the state of California. If you have any concern about privacy at AncientFaces, please submit a request with a thorough description at our [Contact Us](http://www.ancientfaces.com/help/contact) page. Our business changes constantly and this policy along with the Conditions of Use will also change.
