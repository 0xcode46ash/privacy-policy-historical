# Privacy Policy | Ancient Origins

We take seriously your interest in how your information is collected and used. Please read the following to understand about our privacy practices. 

Our Privacy Policy applies to all of the services offered by Ancient Origins, including our website Ancient-Origins.net, mobile site and app (the “Site”), but excludes services that have separate privacy policies that do not incorporate this Privacy Policy. Specifically, it outlines the types of information that we gather about you while you are using the Site, and the ways in which we use and share this information. This Privacy Notice does not apply to any information you may provide to us, or that we may collect, offline and/or through other means. 

Please read this Privacy Notice carefully. By visiting and using the Site, you agree that your use of our Site, and any dispute over our online privacy practices, is governed by this Privacy Notice and our [Disclaimer](http://www.ancient-origins.net/disclaimer). Because the Web is an evolving medium, we may need to change our Privacy Notice at some point in the future, in which case we’ll post the revised Privacy Notice on this website. By continuing to use the Site after we post any such changes, you accept the Privacy Notice as modified. Your access of the Site for the limited and exclusive purpose of reviewing this Privacy Notice does not constitute your acceptance of this Notice unless you make any further access or use of our Site. 

## Information We Collect 

We collect information that you give us or that we get from your use of our Site and services, including without limitation, the following: 

Information about your use of our Site and services, including details of your visits to our Site, pages viewed and the resources that you accessed. Examples of information include device, location and traffic data. 

Information specifically provided by you, including your name, telephone number, email address, physical address, login username, password, or other information that you voluntarily share with us. 

## Use of Cookies 

We may use cookies to gather information about your general internet use. When used, cookies are downloaded and stored on your device. Such information, on its own, will not identify you personally. It is statistical data. Generally you can turn off the cookie function on your device, but that may prevent you from using our Site and services. Some third party services that we use, such as Google Analytics, Quantcast, Clicky, bRealTime and Mobiright  may also place cookies on your device. This Privacy Policy does not cover the use of cookies by third parties. 

## Using Your Information 

We use the information we collect from you to provide, maintain, protect and improve our Site and services, and to develop new ones.  

In addition, we may use the information for one or more of the following purposes: 

  * To provide information to you that you request from us relating to our products or services. 
  * To provide information to you related to products or services provided by us. 
  * To inform you of any changes, offers, updates or other announcements about our Site, services or products. 



Finally, if you install and use any of our products or services, such as a module or any other software, these products will report information to us, and we will collect this information.  This information may be linked to you and we may use this information to better provide technical support to you and our other customers, and to improve our Site, services and products. 

## Storing and Securing your Personal Data and Information 

Our computer servers are currently based in the United States (“U.S.”), so your personal data will be processed by us in the U.S. where data protection and privacy regulations may not offer the same level of protection as in other parts of the world, such as the European Union (“EU”). If you visit and use our Site from outside the U.S., you agree to this Privacy Policy and you consent to the transfer of all such information to the U.S., which may not offer an equivalent level of protection of that required in the EU or certain other countries, and to the processing of that information as described in this Privacy Policy. 

We take all reasonable measures to protect your personal data and information, and to protect our Site from unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of information we maintain.  

## Disclosing Your Information 

We will not disclose your personal information to any other party other than in accordance with this Privacy Policy and in the circumstances detailed below:
