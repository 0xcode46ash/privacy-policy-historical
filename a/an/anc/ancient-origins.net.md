# Privacy Policy | Ancient Origins

We take seriously your interest in how your information is collected and used. Please read the following to understand about our privacy practices.

Our Privacy Policy applies to all of the services offered by Ancient Origins, including our website Ancient-Origins.net, mobile site and app (the “Site”), but excludes services that have separate privacy policies that do not incorporate this Privacy Policy. Specifically, it outlines the types of information that we gather about you while you are using the Site, and the ways in which we use and share this information. This Privacy Notice does not apply to any information you may provide to us, or that we may collect, offline and/or through other means.

Please read this Privacy Notice carefully. By visiting and using the Site, you agree that your use of our Site, and any dispute over our online privacy practices, is governed by this Privacy Notice and our [Disclaimer](http://www.ancient-origins.net/disclaimer). Because the Web is an evolving medium, we may need to change our Privacy Notice at some point in the future, in which case we’ll post the revised Privacy Notice on this website. By continuing to use the Site after we post any such changes, you accept the Privacy Notice as modified. Your access of the Site for the limited and exclusive purpose of reviewing this Privacy Notice does not constitute your acceptance of this Notice unless you make any further access or use of our Site.

## Information We Collect

Information about your use of our Site and services, including details of your visits to our Site, pages viewed and the resources that you accessed. Examples of information include device, location and traffic data.

Information specifically provided by you, including your name, telephone number, email address, physical address, login username, password, or other information that you voluntarily share with us. 

## Use of Cookies

We may use cookies to gather information about your general internet use. When used, cookies are downloaded and stored on your device. Such information, on its own, will not identify you personally. It is statistical data. Generally you can turn off the cookie function on your device, but that may prevent you from using our Site and services. Some third party services that we use, such as Google Analytics, Quantcast, Clicky, bRealTime and Mobiright  may also place cookies on your device. This Privacy Policy does not cover the use of cookies by third parties. 

## Using Your Information

We use the information we collect from you to provide, maintain, protect and improve our Site and services, and to develop new ones.  

In addition, we may use the information for one or more of the following purposes:

  * To provide information to you that you request from us relating to our products or services.
  * To provide information to you related to products or services provided by us.
  * To inform you of any changes, offers, updates or other announcements about our Site, services or products.



Finally, if you install and use any of our products or services, such as a module or any other software, these products will report information to us, and we will collect this information.  This information may be linked to you and we may use this information to better provide technical support to you and our other customers, and to improve our Site, services and products. 

## Storing and Securing your Personal Data and Information

Our computer servers are currently based in the United States (“U.S.”), so your personal data will be processed by us in the U.S. where data protection and privacy regulations may not offer the same level of protection as in other parts of the world, such as the European Union (“EU”). If you visit and use our Site from outside the U.S., you agree to this Privacy Policy and you consent to the transfer of all such information to the U.S., which may not offer an equivalent level of protection of that required in the EU or certain other countries, and to the processing of that information as described in this Privacy Policy. 

We take all reasonable measures to protect your personal data and information, and to protect our Site from unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of information we maintain.

  * Consent: 
    * We may disclose personal information if we have your specific consent to do so.
  * Co-sponsored activities: 
    * When you sign up for a webinar or other activity that is co-sponsored by another company, we may share your registration information with that company.
  * Third Party Services: 
    * We use trusted third party service providers, consultants and other agents to help us provide, maintain, protect and improve our Site, services and products.  We provide personal information to these parties to perform certain tasks based on our instructions and in compliance with our Privacy Policy or an equivalent level of privacy protection.
    * Examples of third party services include data storage, maintenance services, database management, web analytics, payment processing.
  * Legal: 
    * We will share personal information if we have a good-faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to: 
      * meet any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request;
      * enforce applicable Terms of Service or any of our other agreements with you, including investigation of potential breaches;
      * detect, prevent or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues; or

All information you disclose in your public profile, in forum posts, blogs, comments, issue queues, or other public portions of our Site becomes public information.  You should be careful in what you choose to disclose publicly. 

## Accessing and Updating Your Personal Information

You may have access to your personal information that we hold, and correct, amend, or delete that information where it is inaccurate, except where the burden or expense of providing access would be disproportionate to the risks to your privacy, or where the rights of persons other than you would be violated. 

## Other Information Automatically Collected to Improve the Site and Deliver Targeted

Advertising. We also collect and store information through a variety of automatic technologies, such as browser and flash cookies, pixels and web beacons about your use of our Site, including device identifying information such as IP addresses, MAC address or other device-specific alphanumerical ID numbers, the make and model of your device, the wireless provider associated with your device, whether you downloaded the app, the source of the download of the App (for example, whether via a particular advertisement for the App), when the App is launched, how many times a particular page within the Site is visited, which features the users interact with, and your device or computer’s connection to the Internet. If you choose to connect to our Site through a social network such as Facebook, we may automatically collect your profile information. These things allow us, among other things, to improve the delivery of our web pages to you and to measure traffic on the Site.

The information we collect may be collected directly by us, or it may be collected by a third-party website hosting provider, or another third-party service provider, on our behalf.

We also may use “cookies” and other similar technologies on the Site. Cookies are small files that are placed on your hard drive for record-keeping purposes and to enhance your experience with the Site. By showing how and when visitors use the Site, cookies help us deliver advertisements, identify how many unique users visit us, and track user trends and patterns. They also prevent you from having to re-enter your preferences on certain areas of the Site where you may have entered preference information before. This Site also may use web beacons (single-pixel graphic files also known as “transparent GIFs”) to access cookies and to count users who visit the Site or open HTML-formatted email messages.

## Sharing Information with Third Parties for Advertising and Other Promotional Purposes. 

We may use third-party service providers to target and serve some of the advertisements you see on the Site. We may share technical or aggregate information, such as type of pages viewed and categories of interest, from our Site with these service providers and advertisers for their use in displaying ads on our Site. These third party providers and advertisers may use their own browser or flash cookies, web beacons and similar technologies to collect technical information (such as device unique identifier, IP address, MAC address, browser type, pages visited, and location information) from users of the Site that is generated automatically as a user views or interacts with an ad. These service providers may use that information, sometimes in conjunction with similar information gathered through other websites and other sources, to deliver advertisements on this Site, and on other websites.

Unless you affirmatively provide information within an ad, the data collected in connection with the ads, ad serving and ad targeting on our Site does not include your name, address, email address or telephone number, but it may include the device unique identifier, IP address, MAC address and location information of your computer or device. The use and collection of information by third-party advertising service providers is governed by the relevant third party’s privacy policy and is not covered by our Privacy Notice.

For information about use of your information by us and by third-party advertising service providers for advertising, see the section “[Data Collected in Connection with Ad Serving and Targeting.](http://www.courier-journal.com/section/privacy#adchoices)“

Sharing with Third Parties for Other Purposes. Please be aware that we may occasionally release information about our visitors if required to do so by law or if, in our business judgment, such disclosure is reasonably necessary: (a) to comply with legal process; (b) to enforce our [Disclaimer](http://www.ancient-origins.net/disclaimer); or (c) to protect the rights, property, or personal safety of our Site, us, our affiliates, our officers, directors, employees, representatives, our licensors, other users, and/or the public.

Please also note that as our business grows, we may buy or sell various assets. In the unlikely event that we sell some or all of our assets, or our Site is acquired by another company, information about our Site users may be among the transferred assets.
