Privacy Information for Ancestry.ca.  
MyFamily.com, Inc. (MyFamily), operator of this Website (Site), recognizes the confidentiality of information that may be disclosed by members or other visitors in registering or making purchases from our Website and we are firmly committed to protecting your privacy. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for this Website. 

**Overview:**  
The personal, private information that is provided to MyFamily.com, Inc. by individual members is not provided to unrelated third parties except in rare cases involving possible violations of our use policies, legal statutes, or other laws. We do collect some data, always with your knowledge and consent, that is used to fulfill orders and otherwise enhance content to better meet the needs of our users.

Information submitted by you online (such as products you purchase from MyFamily.com, Inc., your name, address, e-mail address) may be shared with internet distribution companies with which MyFamily.com, Inc. has a commercial relationship and through which you reached this site, for marketing purposes. In such circumstances you will be considered their customer as well. If you object to such use, you may opt-out by e-mail request. Under no circumstances will MyFamily.com, Inc. share with any other party your password or other personal information it may acquire about children, family, etc.

Demographic information collected through on-site user surveys may be used in aggregate statistical form to attract potential sponsors.

**Consent:**

Unless permitted by law, no personal information is collected, without first obtaining your consent to the collection, use and dissemination of that information. However, we may seek consent to use and disclose personal information after it has been collected in those cases where we wish to use the information for a new or different purpose where you have not already consented to such a use of your personal information.

**By providing personal information on this website, you agree and consent that we may collect, use and disclose your personal information in accordance with this Policy**.  In addition, where appropriate, specific authorizations or consents may be obtained from time to time. 

In most cases, and subject to legal and contractual restrictions, you are free to refuse or withdraw your consent at any time, upon reasonable advance notice.  Note that in certain circumstances, products or services can only be offered or provided if you provide personal information. Consequently, if you choose not provide us with any required personal information, we may not be able to offer or provide the products or services requested. 

Some of the specifics of our Privacy Policy are best described in the answers to the following Frequently Asked Questions:

**Does MyFamily ask for personal information?**  
Yes. MyFamily asks for your name, e-mail address, and other limited personal information when you sign up as a member and use features such as e-mail, and make purchases at the MyFamily online store. Most of this information may be entered at your discretion. We may ask for similar information at other times, such as when you enter sweepstakes or other promotions sponsored by MyFamily and/or our many partners.

To facilitate payment and fulfillment for membership and purchases at the MyFamily online store, MyFamily will request personal credit card or debit card information. In order to take advantage of other value-added family services that may be offered by MyFamily in the future, users may be required to supply financial information.

**How Does MyFamily use my personal information?**  
Our goal is to provide you with the most personalized, relevant, user-friendly Web experience possible. The primary use of all your personal information is to efficiently provide you with relevant information or services.

MyFamily will also use registration information to let you know about new features or other offers of interest from MyFamily, or to address customer service needs and requests. 

In distributing advertiser or sponsor messages, **the advertiser never has access to individual account information. MyFamily does not sell, rent or otherwise distribute the personal information you provide us to these advertisers.** Advertisers simply provide an insertion order for the advertising message and MyFamily then displays the ad to appropriate users based on the criteria specified in the order.

  
**Will MyFamily disclose any of my personal information to third parties?**  
MyFamily will not disclose any of your personal information, except with your knowledge and consent, or as described in this policy or as may be required by law, or to protect the rights or property of MyFamily.

We may disclose your personal information to individuals or organizations who are our service providers.  Where MyFamily discloses personal information to organizations that perform services on our behalf, we will require those service providers to use such information solely for the purposes of providing services to you or MyFamily and to have appropriate safeguards for the protection of that personal information. 

Other circumstances where limited personal information may be disclosed are specifically described when the data is collected, such as in the User Agreement, or in the rules of sweepstakes or other promotions. So, in all cases you control what, if any, information you disclose.

MyFamily reserves the right to disclose aggregated user statistics, such as "45% of our users are female" or "47% of our users have attended college" in order to describe our services to prospective partners, advertisers, and other third parties. 

Under protection of confidentiality agreements, MyFamily may match common user information, such as name, address and phone number with third party data to avoid duplication of promotional mailings, to comply with CAN SPAM and other laws and to prevent errors. 

Additionally, if you click away from MyFamily to visit the site of any third party advertiser or sponsor, you may be asked for your credit card or other personal information in order to purchase or use products and services offered. These companies have their own privacy and data collection practices. MyFamily has no responsibility or liability for these independent policies. You should therefore review their privacy policies carefully if you have concerns about how your information may be used.

**Where does MyFamily keep my information?**  
Currently, the principal place in which MyFamily holds personal information is in the city of Provo, Utah , Unites States of America, and nearby municipalities where off-site hosting or storage facilities may be located.

**Will MyFamily use my information for direct mailings?**  
MyFamily will send electronic mail to you, for the purpose of informing you of changes or additions to MyFamily, or of any MyFamily related products and services. If you do not want to receive such mailings, you may opt out at any time by using the unsubscribe link listed in the e-mail or by making appropriate selections in the MyAccount tab on the Site.

**May I refuse to provide personal information to MyFamily or to accept advertising?**  
Visitors may access MyFamily’s free services by providing a first name, last name, and e-mail address. To gain full access to the members-only areas, a username, e-mail address and appropriate billing information are required. Because the MyFamily site is partially advertiser supported, you may not "turn off" the advertising that appears on MyFamily pages, but you may opt to be excluded from any e-mail advertising.

**How does MyFamily protect my information?**  
MyFamily endeavours to maintain appropriate physical, procedural and technical security with respect to its offices and information storage facilities, so as to prevent any loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, or modification of personal information. This also applies to our disposal or destruction of personal information.

MyFamily further protects personal information by restricting access to it to those of our personnel who have a need to know that information in order that we may provide our products or services.

**May I access and review my personal information held by MyFamily?**  
MyFamily permits the reasonable right of access and review of your personal information held by us by allowing you to access account information via the MyAccount tab on the site.

MyFamily reserves the right to decline to provide access to personal information where the information requested:

a)     Would disclose (i) personal information, including opinions, about another individual or about a deceased individual; or (ii) trade secrets or other business or confidential information that may harm MyFamily or the competitive position of a third party;

b)     Would interfere with contractual or other negotiations of MyFamily or a third party;

c)     Is subject to solicitor-client, litigation or other legal privilege; 

d)     Is not readily retrievable and the burden or cost of providing the information would be disproportionate to the nature or value of the information;

e)     Does not exist, is not held, or cannot be found by MyFamily; 

f)       Could reasonably result in (i) serious harm to the treatment or recovery of the individual concerned, (ii) serious emotional harm to the individual concerned or another individual, or (iii) serious bodily harm to another individual; 

g)     May harm or interfere with law enforcement activities and other investigative or regulatory functions of a body authorized by law to perform such functions; or

h)     May be withheld or is requested to be withheld under applicable legislation.

Where information will not or cannot be disclosed, you will be provided with the reasons for non-disclosure.

**Does MyFamily use "IP Addresses" and cookies?**  
IP Addresses: We do use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our Web site. Your IP address is also used to gather broad demographic information such as geographic distribution of our members.

**MyFamily Cookies:**  
Contrary to popular myth, cookies do not extract private or personal information from your computer’s memory, but rather, record only information you volunteer to us upon registering or visiting the site. Cookies are tiny files placed onto the hard drive of your computer when you register at our Web site that enable our server to recognize or "remember" who you are each time you return. MyFamily may make limited use of cookies to deliver content specific to your interests. For instance they may be used to retain your personal preferences, hold session information for a "shopping basket," or save your password so it doesn’t have to be re-entered each time you login.

**Advertiser Cookies:**  
We may use third-party advertising companies to serve ads on our behalf. These companies may employ cookies and action tags (also known as single pixel gifs or web beacons) to measure advertising effectiveness. 

**What else should I know about privacy?**  
The following encapsulates a few key issues mentioned in context above. 

**Contests & Promotions**  
MyFamily may occasionally run contests or other special promotions on our site in which we ask members or visitors for contact information (like an e-mail address) or demographic information (like a zip code, age, or income level). We use this data to send you promotional material about our company or our partners. Your contact information is also used to contact you when necessary and may be shared with other companies for promotional purposes, but only with your prior permission and under the terms and conditions specified when you take part in the promotion. At any time, you may opt-out of receiving future mailings of this kind, or simply decline to take part in the promotions.
