# Our Privacy Philosophy

Ancestry.com is the world’s largest online family history resource. Our mission is to help everyone discover, preserve, and share their family history. We recognize that your family history includes personal information about you and your family, so protecting your privacy is at the core of what we do. 

These are our privacy principles: 

**Help you share your family history research safely** **  
**We believe that the entire family history community benefits when people share their family history. You may discover new stories about your ancestors—or even find a cousin or two—while your tree may help another member fill gaps in their family tree. We recognize that the information about living family members can be sensitive so we have safeguards to hide living individuals within family trees.  


**Give you choices about what and how you share** **  
** When you share information within the Ancestry Community, we believe you should always have meaningful choices of what and how you share information about yourself and your family tree. You should be able to manage what people can learn about you, what content they can see, and even how you can be contacted.   


**Give you credit for your contributions** **  
** We want you to get credit and recognition for the content you share with the Ancestry Community. Any information you post on the site will be linked to your profile, even if others copy what you have shared. This lets others know who the original source of the material is.    


**Keep privacy features and policies clear and simple** **  
** We make every effort to be transparent about our policies relating to your privacy. We want you to understand what personal information we collect from and about you, what we do with it, and how you can manage your privacy settings. **  
**

**Be responsible with the information you entrust to us** **  
** We know how valuable your family history is and understand the personal nature of your family tree. We employ a variety of technical and organizational measures to protect your information so you’ll feel safe preserving and sharing your information within the Ancestry Community. **  
**

We also encourage you to read our comprehensive [**Privacy Statement**](https://web.archive.org/cs/legal/privacystatement), which explains in more detail **** how we collect and process your personal data **.** **
