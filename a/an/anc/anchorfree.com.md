AnchorFree, Inc. ("AnchorFree") recognizes the importance of protecting the privacy of all information provided to us by any user of Hotspot Shield (collectively or individually "User(s)"). Hotspot Shield makes Users anonymous, to both AnchorFree and other third parties, by assigning each User a virtual IP address. Hotspot Shield automatically collects certain non-personally identifiable information from Users that is used in the aggregate only.

Your use of Hotspot Shield is subject to the terms of this Privacy Notice. Please note that the AnchorFree website located at www.anchorfree.com has a different privacy notice that governs the use of personal information collected on that site.

**NOTE TO KIDS** : THE HOTSPOT SHIELD IS NOT AVAILABLE TO PERSONS UNDER THE AGE OF 13. _If you are under 13 years of age, please do not use the Hotspot Shield_ , there are lots of other great web sites for you, check out http://yahooligans.yahoo.com/.

**_Our Commitment to User Privacy:_**

AnchorFree Hotspot Shield is committed to keeping all User identity private from third parties and from AnchorFree. We do not collect any personally identifiable information on Hotspot Shield. Furthermore, we assign each User of Hotspot Shield with a virtual identity to keep each User�s real identity private. We place Users in control of their identity and personal information online and keep the identity of Users using Hotspot Shield private on the Internet. 

Please note that Hotspot Shield only enables privacy and encrypts user Internet sessions when it is turned ON. Having Hotspot Shield on the desktop, without turning it ON does not do anything. Unless Users turn Hotspot Shield ON and opt into the service, Hotspot Shield will be completely idle.

**_Our Commitment to Web Security:_**

Hotspot Shield encrypts every page visited by our Users, thus creating a virtual private network tunnel between each User and the Internet. This enables every page visited to go through HTTP(S) encryption. All activities on Hotspot Shield are secured and encrypted, so that personal information is kept secure and that such activities as online shopping, signing into email accounts, conducting financial transactions online are protected.

Please note that Hotspot Shield secures your Internet session, not your computer. Hotspot Shield does not protect your computer from viruses or malware. We recommend getting anti-virus/anti-malware solutions from one of our reputable partners in order to also secure your computer.

AnchorFree Hotspot Shield uses commercially reasonable physical, managerial, and technical safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of any information collected. We cannot, however, ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to AnchorFree Hotspot Shield, and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission of information, AnchorFree makes commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the security of our systems. However, please note that this is not a guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards. 

If AnchorFree learns of a security systems breach, we may post a notice on the AnchorFree Hotspot Shield to notify Users. 

**_The Information Hotspot Shield Collects:_**

**"Cookies" Information**.  When you use Hotspot Shield, we may send one or more cookies � a small text file containing a string of alphanumeric characters � to your computer. The Hotspot Shield uses both session cookies and persistent cookies. A persistent cookie remains after you close your browser and may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the Hotspot Shield. These persistent type of cookies can be removed, but each web browser is a little different, so please look through your browser "Help" file to learn the correct way to modify your cookies set-up. 

**"Automatically Collected" Information**   When you use the Hotspot Shield, we automatically record certain information from your web browser by using different types of proprietary technology. The automatically collected information does not identify a User personally, and AnchorFree only uses the automatically collected information in the aggregate to monitor the advertisements displayed on the Hotspot Shield.

**_The Way AnchorFree Uses Information collected from Hotspot Shield:_**

AnchorFree may use the automatically collected information in the aggregate to monitor the advertisements displayed on the Hotspot Shield, and for purposes of research or analysis.

Please note by having Hotspot Shield on your computer, no information is collected by AnchorFree. Anonymous web information may only be collected when you turn Hotspot Shield ON.

**_When AnchorFree Discloses Information collected from Hotspot Shield:_**

AnchoFree may share anonymous data with a variety of third parties, including its affiliates, advertisers, and other current and prospective business partners. AnchorFree may use anonymous data collected for website administration, advertising, and promotional purposes, and may share such information with various affiliated and unaffiliated entities for such purposes. AnchorFree may also enter into agreements with outside companies that possess technology that allows us to customize the advertising and marketing messages Users receive while using the Hotspot Shield. 

AnchorFree may disclose automatically collected and other aggregate non-personally-identifiable information with interested third parties to assist such parties in understanding the usage, viewing, and demographic patterns for certain programs, content, services, advertisements, promotions, and/or functionality on the Hotspot Shield. 

**_Third-party Advertisers, Links to Other Sites on the Hotspot Shield:_**

AnchorFree allows other companies, called third-party ad servers or ad networks, to serve advertisements within the Hotspot Shield. These third-party ad servers or ad networks use technology to send, directly to your browser, the advertisements and links that appear on the Hotspot Shield. They automatically receive the virtual IP Address assigned by AnchorFree when this happens. They may also use other technologies (such as cookies, javascript, or web beacons) to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements and to personalize their advertising content.

AnchorFree's Hotspot Shield Privacy Notice does not apply to, and we cannot control the activities of, such other advertisers or other web sites visited by Users.

**_Changes and updates to this Hotspot Shield Privacy Notice:_**

This Hotspot Shield Privacy Notice may be revised periodically and this will be reflected by the "last modified" notice above. Please revisit this page to stay aware of any changes. Your continued use of the Hotspot Shield constitutes your agreement to this Hotspot Shield Privacy Notice and any future revisions.
