Information Sharing and Disclosure

Aggregate Information (non-personally identifiable)

We may share aggregated demographic information about our user base with future professional services sponsors. This information does not identify individual users. We do not link aggregate user data with personally identifiable information.

Legal Disclaimer

We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our Web site

Log Files

As is true of most Web sites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp and clickstream data. 

We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track usersХ movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We do not link this automatically-collected data to personally identifiable information

Cookies

A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a userХs computer for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies on this site. We use both session ID cookies and/or persistent cookies. A session ID cookie expires when you close you browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time; itХs used to store things like passwords so you donХt have to enter them more than once. You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browserХs "help" file. If you reject cookies, you may still use our site, but your ability to use some areas of our site may be limited.

Some of our business partners or linked sites may use cookies on our site. We have no access to or control over these cookies. This privacy statement covers the use of cookies by [www.angelsoft.net](http://www.angelsoft.net/) only and does not cover the use of cookies by any third parties linked to this site.

Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs)

We employ a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a userХs computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customersХ personally identifiable information. 

We use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns. If you would like to opt-out of these emails, please see "Choice and Opt-out."

Links to Other Sites

This Web site contains links to other sites that are not owned or controlled by Angelsoft LLC. Please be aware that we, Angelsoft, are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage you to be aware when you leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies only to information collected by this web site.

Access to Personally Identifiable Information

If your personally identifiable information changes, or if you no longer desire to receive information from us, you may correct, update, delete or deactivate it by making the change on our member information page or by emailing us at [subscriptions@angelsoft.net](mailto:subscriptions@angelsoft.net) or by contacting us by telephone or postal mail at the contact information listed below.

Security

The security of your personal information is important to us. When you enter sensitive information (such as private group information) on our information request forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

If you have any questions about security on our Web site, you can send email us at [webmaster@angelsoft.net](mailto:webmaster@angelsoft.net).

Business Transitions

In the event Angelsoft LLC goes through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, your personally identifiable information will likely be among the assets transferred. You will be notified via a prominent notice on our web site for 30 days of any such change in ownership or control of your personal information.

Changes in this Privacy Statement

If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement, the homepage, and other places we deem appropriate so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.

We reserve the right to modify this privacy statement at any time, so please review it frequently. If we make material changes to this policy, we will notify you here, by email, or by means of a notice on our home page.
