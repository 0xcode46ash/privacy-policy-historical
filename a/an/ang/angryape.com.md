# Privacy â€“ AngryApe

We take your privacy very seriously, and we are committed to maintaining the trust of our users. This Privacy Statement will help you understand what types of information we collect, and how we use it.

We automatically receive and record information from our servers and from your web browser, including your IP address, what pages you visited on this site, and the times you visited them. Unless you have registered for one of our products or services, the information we gather through the use of tracking technologies cannot be matched with any personally identifiable information about you. If you have specifically given us personally identifiable information, such as when signing up to a newsletter, we will only use your information for the specific purposes intended.

We may disclose certain information to third parties, such as advertisers for marketing, promotional and other purposes. We do not disclose any information that could be used to identify you personally, unless you have specifically asked us to. In the event that personally identifiable material is requested from us by a law-enforcement agency or court of law then we will disclose such information.

Users who do not wish to provide any information requested from registration processes do not need to register, however the specific content and features that use that registration information may not be available to you. Most of this site is still available without the use of registration. Users are able to remove themselves from mailing lists/newsletters at any time, unless there are technical problems at that time.

We cannot guarantee that any information you provide to us is completely safe, and there may be occasions when technical problems beyond our control make information available to unauthorised persons. We do however take reasonable care to prevent any such problems occurring.
