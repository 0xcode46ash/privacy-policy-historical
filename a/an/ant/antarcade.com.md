We Really Care About Your Privacy  
Ant Arcade created this section of the web site, dedicated to explaining the way we operate our business. It also explains what you, as our visitor, will experience when visiting our site and outlines your privacy rights.

Questions regarding this statement should be directed to Customer Service by email, 

Information you provide us via the following: 

Order Form  
Ant Arcade requires your name, billing address, phone number, email address, shipping address and credit card information to process an order. We also use this information if the need arises, to contact you about your order. Firstly, we will try to contact you by email and only if that fails, or if time is critical, will we try to contact you by phone. We process your orders ourselves, in house so your details remain with us. 

When we have to share this information, it will only be necessary information with third parties for the processing of your order. For example, the financial institution that issued your credit card and the parcel service that delivers your order. Any sharing of personal information will only occur with service providers (banks, credit card verifiers, etc.) in processing orders. 

Ant Arcade does not give shoppers the Paypal option for payments. Be aware that Paypal requires you to enter your personal and financial information on the Paypal website. For information provided on the Paypal web site, refer to Paypal’s Privacy Policy.

‘Contact Us’ Emails  
Contact us by email via the Contact Us form. For a suggestion or problem, you will be prompted for your name and email address. We will only use that information to send you a quick reply. As all service related emails are related to our service and are not promotional, there is no opt-out or unsubscribe option. For example, on registering, sending a new user their name and password.

Contest Entry Form  
Entry to our contests requires your name, mailing address and email address. Also we need you to maintain a subscription to our free email newsletter. The contest rules state that you give us permission, should you be a winner, to publish your name, city, state and country on our web site. Winners will be notified by email. Prize redemption instructions will be sent by post to the address given on your entry form. Your personal information will not be used for any other purpose and you will not receive any additional mailings. Please be advised that contests will only take place occasionally.

Information We Automatically Collect 

Shopper ID  
On your first visit to our store, we assign you a unique Shopper ID and attempt to store that onto your computer in the form of a cookie. This is used to keep track of your shopping bag during your visit and between visits. Cookies used by antarcade.com are not tied to personally identifiable information. If you are uncomfortable with the idea of being assigned a Shopper ID, we recommend disabling cookie support in your browser (please see your browser documentation for specific procedures). You may still place an order by phone, fax or postal mail. Disabling cookie support will disable the shopping bag feature of our site.

IP Address  
IP addresses are recorded as a means of monitoring the level of activity on our site, but we do not link this to your Shopper ID. When clicking a link from an affiliate’s web site to gain entry to our web site, we will try to store the affiliate’s ID as a cookie. We do this so the affiliate web site receives credit for any order you might place. Your personal information will not be shared with any of our affiliates.

AntArcade.com uses industry standard SSL encryption when accepting your credit card information during our online checkout process. 

We may include links to other sites. Although we choose these sites, based on their integrity, we cannot be responsible for the site’s privacy policies and content. We will let you know when a link goes to another site.

Order information  
Changes to your order can be made by contact us via email [sales@AntArcade.com](mailto:sales@AntArcade.com) or phone  02 9664 8142 (Within Australia) or 0011 612 9964 8142 (International Calls) and we will be happy to assist you. A confirmation email will be sent from antarcade.com after receiving any changes/updates to 

your order. 

Contest entry  
Remove your registration from our contest by sending us an email with your email address. A confirmation of your request will be sent to the email address and your contest entry will be deleted. To make any other changes to your contest entry, please contact us via email or phone and we will happy to assist you. For any of the above issues contact us via email.

Account Information   
Ant Arcade account holders can access and change account information; shipping/billing addresses, password, email, subscriptions, credit card (if you choose to store it) and open orders. Click the My Account tab on top of every page and log-in providing your email and password.

Changes in Privacy Statement/Information  
If we are going to use your personal information for a purpose other than that which is stated, we will notify you via email. You will have a choice as to whether or not we use your information. If we make any additional changes in our privacy practices affecting user information, we will post an obvious notice on our web site notifying users of the change. We will also email users, who have chosen to receive communications from us.

Cookies  
Cookies are pieces of information that a web site stores in your computer. Temporary cookies only last as long as your browser is running. Persistent cookies are stored on your hard disk (they take up very little space). Sites often use cookies to identify repeat visitors.

IP Address  
When you connect to the internet, your computer has a unique internet ID, an IP address. By connecting with a dial-up service, a different IP address is issued each time at login. Others might have a permanently assigned IP address, called a static IP address. It is difficult or impossible for a web site to collect personal information about you (i.e. your name, email address, etc.) from your IP address alone, though a static IP address makes this easier.

Shopper ID  
Shoppers are assigned an ID when they visit an online store with a shopping bag system. Each store will assign a different ID. Many stores use a cookie to save a Shopper ID for re-use on a return visit. 

SSL Encryption  
SSL Encryption is the means in which information is transmitted across the Internet. It is scrambled so it's indecipherable by anyone intercepting the data prior to reaching its destination. Most reputable online stores use SSL encryption when requesting credit card information and sensitive data from their shoppers. SSL encryption web sites are identified by a symbol displayed in the web browser. Refer to browser documentation for the symbol and its location.
