# Privacy Policy|ANTlabs

**Overview**

ANTlabs has developed these global information practices to assure that your privacy is respected and your personal data is protected. Our Privacy Policy discloses ANTlabs' online information practices for handling personal and non-personal information, which is meant to comply with applicable local laws and regulations. Please read this Privacy Policy carefully before you use any of ANTlabs' web sites ("Site(s)").

 **How your information is used**

ANTlabs will not sell, rent, loan or lease your personally identifiable information to others unless we have your permission or are required by law to do so. ANTlabs will not use or share the personally identifiable information that you provide to us online in ways unrelated to those described herein without first letting you know and offering you a choice to opt out.

Because ANTlabs operates globally, we may need to share your personal information with our worldwide business units. We will only share your information with other ANTlabs entities (including subsidiaries and affiliates) and/or business partners who are acting on our behalf to provide the necessary service or information requested by you, to consolidate data storage, or to simplify the management of customer information. Such ANTlabs entities and/or business partners are governed by our Privacy Policy with respect to the use of this data and are bound by appropriate confidentiality agreements.

 **Information we collect**

 **Non-personally identifiable information**

As a visitor to our Site, you can engage in many activities without providing any personal information. We do, however, collect and aggregate information indicating, among other things, which pages were visited, the order in which they were visited, and which hyperlinks were "clicked" with Cookies. Such information is not linked to any personally identifiable information. The non-personally identifiable information we collect help us identify the most popular areas of our Site and determine the effectiveness of our promotional activities.

  *  **Cookies**  
Cookies are text files that store some information on your computer's hard drive and allow our systems to recognize your browser. Cookies collect information like IP addresses, operating systems and browser software, but they do not collect any personal information. Cookies let you customize your experience at our Site.

We also use cookies to record anonymous information pertaining to particular web pages viewed, which helps us in analysing trends, tracking user's movement, and gathering broad demographic information for aggregate use. In this effort, we may also use measurement technologies from our business partners to assist us in gathering and analysing that data.




 **Personally identifiable information**

At some ANTlabs sites, you can order products, register for materials, make requests, download software, enter contests, vote in polls or otherwise express an opinion, subscribe to one of our services, such as our online newsletters, or participate in one of our online forums or communities. The types of personally identifiable information that may be collected at these pages include: name, address, e-mail address, telephone number, fax number, credit card information, and information about your interests in and use of various products, programs, and services. Data collected online may also be combined with information you provide when you register your ownership of ANTlabs products. ANTlabs uses your information to better understand your needs and to provide you with better service.

 **Why we collect your personal information**

  *  **Online Registration**  
Information collected from online registration will be used to improve our products and services. With your permission, we will send you information about new products or services from ANTlabs.


  *  **Surveys and Promotions**  
From time to time our Sites may request information from you via surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and you have a choice whether or not to disclose any information. Information requested may include contact information, such as your name and your shipping address, to notify the winner(s) and demographic information, such as your age for eligibility purposes. Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of our Site.


  *  **Mailing Lists**  
ANTlabs occasionally provides the opportunity for visitors to supply their email address for the purpose of receiving a specific newsletter or product information. These email addresses will only be used for this purpose and will never be shared with unaffiliated third parties unless you have provided your consent for us to do so. At a minimum, we will always give you the opportunity to opt out of receiving such materials. In addition, where applicable, we will follow all local requirements, such as allowing you to opt in before receiving unsolicited contact.



 **How we protect your information**

To prevent unauthorized access or disclosure, to maintain data accuracy and to ensure the appropriate use of information, we have put into place physical, electronic and managerial procedures to safeguard the information that we collect online. We use encryption when collecting or transferring data such as credit card information.

 **Third Party Web Sites**

Please note that our Privacy Policy only applies to sites controlled by ANTlabs and links to third party web sites are provided solely as a convenience to you. You are advised to check the privacy policies of those sites before providing your personal information to them. ANTlabs has not reviewed all of these third party web sites, does not control and is not responsible for any of these sites, their content or their privacy policies. Thus, ANTlabs does not endorse or make any representations about these sites, or any information, products or other materials that may be found there.
