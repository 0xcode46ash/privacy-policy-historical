# What is Answerbag's Privacy Policy? | Answerbag.com

Answerbag makes every effort to protect your privacy. We collect limited personal information so that we can better serve you, and that personal information will never be shared with a third party without your explicit permission. If you have any concern about your personal information, please feel free to contact us, and we will assist you with any concerns. If you decide you�d like us to delete all of your information, we can do that as well. Just like Burger King, we do it your way.

We do not sell our users� information, nor do we share it with any third parties without your explicit permission, or if we are required to by a law enforcement agency that has the appropriate jurisdiction. If you feel the need to give us explicit permission and are looking forward to having your information shared with our partners, feel free to drop us an email.

Answerbag will only collect your personal information during specific transactions:

Sign in  
When you sign in, we will ask for your name, age, and email address. We require your age because no one under 13 is allowed to post content to the site. We ask for your email address so that we can verify your email address, so other people cannot register for you. We do this to protect you and your email account, because no one needs more spam than they already get.

Purchases  
If you make a purchase on the site, we will ask for the minimum information necessary to verify that you are the one making the purchase, and not someone else with your credit card. We will ask for your address, your credit card number, and the expiration date to make sure that the card�s owner is the one who is using it. If you notice any charges from our site that you did not authorize, please contact your bank first to shut off the card, and then contact us so we can restore your account to your control.

Surveys  
We may, from time to time, have site surveys in which we will ask for some demographic information, along with your opinions of our site. Any information we request for these surveys is strictly for internal purposes, to help us understand our users. We may share cumulative data with our partners (average age of our users, etc.), but we will never share with our partners your name, your personal information, or your contact information. This demographic data will be entirely anonymous, and only for statistical purposes. We like to do math in our spare time.

If you receive any email correspondence claiming to be from Answerbag.com that includes requests for your personal information or that asks you to log into any URL that does NOT begin with �Answerbag.com�, please report it to us immediately. Some ne�er-do-wells have attempted such shenanigans before, in an attempt to steal other users� passwords, so please be aware of these scams.

Cookies  
Much fuss has been made about �cookies� on the Internet. However, they are almost always as benign as their namesake. On Answerbag, we use cookies so that you don�t have to keep logging in every time you click to a new page. This also allows us to remember you if you come back to our site after a day or two. We can�t imagine why you�d stay away that long, but we developed this technology anyway. 

Our cookies cannot and will not:  
\- Track where you go after you leave our site  
\- Remember passwords or usernames (or anything else) from other web sites  
\- Create pop-up ads  
\- Crash your computer  
\- Give your computer, or you, a virus  
\- Alter or delete cookies from other web sites  
\- Give you a leisurely hot oil massage

Children�s Privacy  
Children under the age of 13 are not allowed to post to our website. If we discover that a child under 13 has managed to create an account and post anything, we will immediately delete all content they contributed and we will delete the account. So tell Junior to not even try it. If a parent informs us that their child has managed to create an account, they may request all information related to the account before we delete it, and we will honor that request promptly.

Other users  
Answerbag allows you to post your email address publicly on our site so that other users who share your interests may contact you, but it is not required. Also, it is conceivable that you could post your own contact information else where on our site in the FAQs. There are many other people using Answerbag, and if you post your email address or other information, one of them may try to contact you. Answerbag cannot be held responsible for the content or means of this communication, and we recommend that you only share information that you wouldn�t mind sharing with hundreds (or thousands) of other people.

Links  
At times, we may have links on our site to our partners, or users may post URLs to the FAQs. As closely as we guard your personal information at Answerbag, we cannot be held responsible for these sites and their business practices. If we discover that one of these sites is behaving fraudulently or is neglecting the privacy of its users, we will remove those links as soon as possible. If you find broken links on those web sites, well, we�re sorry.

Contact  
Our primary contact method is email - please contact us at admin@answerbag.com.
