When you create an account with Anki, you provide your name, email address, phone number and create a password.

We may also collect your Internet Protocol (‘IP’) address. We use your IP address to diagnose problems with our servers, software, to administer our Services and to gather demographic information.

We do not collect more personal information than is reasonably necessary to participate in an activity on the Website or App or enhance your gameplay experience.

**Automatically as you navigate through the site: Usage Details, Cookies and Other Technologies**

When you visit our Website, certain information is or can be automatically recorded. Generally, we use this information in an aggregated and anonymized way. If we need to combine this type of information with personal information, we treat it as such. Automatically collected information includes:

  * Statistical or technical information such as, for example, your computer’s Internet Protocol address, operating system and browser type, time and date, and how you navigate through and interact with the Website.
  * Information collected via “cookies” or “web beacons,” which are small data files that we transfer to your computer for recordkeeping purposes. We primarily use cookies for login session management. Anki cookies do not collect personal information from you, and we do not combine the information collected through cookies with other personal information you may provide to identify you. You can change the options on your browser to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from a website.

  * When you use our Website we may collect “click stream data” (server address, domain name, etc.). This information can be combined with information you have provided to us, which will enable us to analyze and better customize your visits. We may use click stream data for traffic analysis or e-commerce analysis, to determine which features within our Website are most or least effective or useful to you.

Our marketing emails relate to our product and services offerings: software, hardware products, promotions, news, and events. Our emails may contain “beacons,” which are small images that inform us about recipients’ receptiveness to our emails. Our third-party mail service provider also provides us with anonymized and aggregated demographic information about the respondents to our emails. In our emails, we may also ask you to voluntarily provide us with additional information about you. Generally, we use information from our marketing and research communications in an aggregated and anonymized way.
