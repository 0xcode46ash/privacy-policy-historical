# Privacy | AGL Energy

The AGL Group comprises the companies set out in the AGL Group of Companies list. All references to "AGL", "we", "us" and "our" in this Privacy Policy apply to these companies. 

AGL is bound by the National Privacy Principles (Principles) contained in the Privacy Act 1988 (Privacy Act). The Principles are designed to protect the confidentiality of information and the privacy of individuals by regulating the way personal information is managed. Personal information is, generally, information or an opinion relating to an individual, which can be used to identify that individual. 

## Why does AGL collect personal information?

AGL collects certain personal information in order to understand and meet the needs of customers and provide the products and services they require. 

## What types of personal information does AGL collect?

The types of personal information that we collect may include information about:

  * customers; 
  * shareholders; 
  * suppliers; 
  * employees; 
  * personal contacts at corporate clients or suppliers; 
  * applicants for employment with AGL; and 
  * other people who come into contact in the ordinary course of business.



This information is collected in a variety of ways, including by way of personal contact such as business activities and events, as well as mail, telephone, email and internet. Please note that our websites do not provide systems for secure transmission across the internet, except where indicated. 

We may also collect and use personal information available from public sources, such as telephone listings, and from private sources where it is necessary to identify customers. For example, builders and real estate agents may provide details of new occupants and tenants who are using gas and/or electricity.

**Employee exemption:** Companies within the AGL Group are not bound by the Principles in relation to handling of their own current or former employees' records, if those records relate directly to the employment relationship. Where employee records are handled by other companies within the AGL Group, the Group will observe the Principles. 

## How does AGL use and disclose personal information? 

In general, AGL may use or disclose personal information for the following purposes: 

  * to provide products and services to customers; 
  * to service shareholders; 
  * to communicate with contractors and suppliers; 
  * to provide administration for employees within the AGL Group; 
  * to provide ongoing information about our products and services to people that we believe may be interested; 
  * to help manage and enhance our products and services, including by surveying customers on their future needs; 
  * to consider applications for employment; and 
  * to comply with legal obligations.



We also use your personal information to promote and market products and services to you, including through electronic methods such as email and SMS.  This is to keep you informed of products, services and special offers and may continue after you cease to acquire services from us.

If you do not wish us to contact you to promote and market products, services and special offers (whether it be through electronic methods or otherwise), or if you have subscribed to any of our newsletters or subscriptions and no longer wish to receive such communications, please call 131 245

Also, if you are the contact person for a customer or supplier, we may use your personal information such as your name to manage our relationship with your organisation.

Depending on the product or service or issue concerned, we may disclose personal information to: 

  * service providers and specialist advisers who have been contracted to provide administrative, financial, research or other services; 
  * insurers, credit providers, courts, tribunals and regulatory authorities (including the Australian Tax Office) as required or authorised by law; 
  * credit reporting or reference agencies or insurance investigators; or 
  * anyone authorised by an individual, as specified by that individual or the contract.



We may give personal information about you to a credit reporting agency, whether before, during or after the provision of credit to you, for the following purposes:

  * to obtain a consumer credit report about you; and/or 
  * to allow the credit reporting agency to create or maintain a credit information file containing information about you



However, the information that we are permitted to give to a credit reporting agency is limited to:

  * your name, sex, date of birth, current and previous two addresses; 
  * the name of your employer; 
  * your driver's licence number; 
  * the fact that you have applied for credit and the amount; 
  * the fact that AGL is a current credit provider to you; 
  * information that, in our opinion, suggests you have committed a serious credit infringement (that is, that you have acted fraudulently or shown an intention not to comply with your credit obligations); and 
  * the fact that a cheque drawn by you has been dishonoured more than once.



## Note for shareholders

If you hold AGL shares or other AGL securities, you may be required to provide us with your tax file number, which is kept securely on the relevant share register. In accordance with Australian tax laws, we may provide certain advice to the Australian Tax Office, including dividend information.

Under Section 173 of the Corporations Act 2001, AGL is required to grant access on request to its share register. The share register sets out all shareholders' names, addresses and share holdings. We may provide information from the share register to meet specific requests such as identifying the top 100 shareholders. Shareholder information is not knowingly disclosed for purposes other than those which we consider to be in the interests of the shareholder, the investor market, brokers, financial journals and market analysts. 

AGL may disclose your personal information to your stockbroker, accountant, a family member or other person who you have authorised to be contacted on your behalf. In those circumstances, you will be required to identify that party as your authorised agent. 

## Does AGL collect sensitive information? 

We will obtain your consent prior to collecting, using or disclosing your sensitive information, unless the collection of the information is required by law. Sensitive information is information or an opinion about an individual's racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, membership of a political association, religious beliefs or affiliations, philosophical beliefs, membership of a professional or trade association, membership of a trade union, sexual preferences or practices, criminal record or health information. 

## Management of personal information

AGL has implemented appropriate technological and organisational measures to assist us in ensuring that the personal information we hold about you is accurate and up-to-date. We realise however that your personal information may change frequently with changes of address and personal circumstance. Please contact us promptly at the address set out below to inform us of any changes to your personal information. Similarly, if you have subscribed to any of our newsletters or subscriptions, or are receiving promotional communications, and no longer wish to receive such communications, you may opt out of receiving them at any time. 

We expect our employees and contractors who handle personal information to comply with the _Privacy Act_ and will take appropriate action in response to breaches of the obligations imposed by the Principles. Although we seek to engage external service providers who also comply with these requirements, we do not accept responsibility for the misuse of personal information by these third parties.

## Accessing your personal information

Under the Principles, you usually have the right to obtain a copy of any personal information which AGL Energy holds about you and to advise us of any perceived inaccuracy. We will consider any recommendation by you to change or correct information and advise you of the action taken. You may request to access your personal information by contacting us at the number or address set out below. Depending upon the personal information you seek, you may be asked:

  * to complete an Information Request Form; 
  * to verify your identity in writing; and/or; 
  * if the inquiry involves extensive administration time or resources, to pay a fee. If this is the case, we will advise the likely cost in advance and can help refine your request if required.



Please note that in circumstances prescribed by the Privacy Act, you may be refused access to your personal information (for example, if providing access would be unlawful or would have an unreasonable impact upon the privacy of other individuals).
