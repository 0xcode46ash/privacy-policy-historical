# AGL Resources | Privacy Policy

|    
PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING PRIVACY POLICY CAREFULLY. By using this site, you are deemed to have agreed to this policy. This Privacy Policy will advise you about how we protect your personal information, and about your choices concerning our use of your personal information. Please read this policy carefully. We may need to change this policy from time to time in order to address new issues and reflect changes on our site. We will post those changes here so please refer back to this policy regularly. 

If you have any questions or concerns about our privacy policy, please send us an e-mail to: [AGLRprivacy@aglresources.com](mailto:AGLRprivacy@aglresources.com?subject=Inquiry%20from%20AGLResources.com). 

**Personal Identification Information**   
We will collect personal identification information from you only if you voluntarily give it to us. 

Except as specified in this Section, we will not intentionally disclose any personal identification information about you as an individual user (such as, your full name, street address, telephone number, credit card number or e-mail address) to any third party without your consent or permission. AGL Resources may share your information with other AGL Resources affiliated companies. Your information may be shared with agents or contractors of AGL Resources in connection with services that these individuals or entities perform for AGL Resources. 

We may request personal identification information from you in connection with your use of, or participation in, surveys, registrations, requests for suggestions, and in connection with other activities, services or resources we make available to you. Again, please note that you must voluntarily give this information to us. If you identify yourself to us by sending us an e-mail with questions or comments, we may use your personal information to respond to your questions or comments. 

We may also use personal identification information for internal or external marketing and promotional purposes. On occasion, for example, we may send you e-mails to introduce a product or service that we think might be of interest to you. You may choose to "opt-out" of receiving information from us at any time, after you have provided personal identification information, by following the procedures described at the end of this Privacy Policy. Please note, however, that under certain circumstances, if you "opt-out," you may not be eligible for certain benefits for which a name, e-mail address, telephone number or other personal identification information is needed. 

Additionally, we will release specific information about you to comply with any valid legal process such as a search warrant, subpoena, statute or court order. We will also release specific information in special cases, such as if there is an attempted breach of the security of the AGL Resources site, or a physical threat to you or others. 

**Non-Personal Information And The Use Of Cookie Technology**   
We may collect non-personal information through the use of either "cookie" technology, IP address tracking or both. Non-personal information is information that does not identify you personally and might include the browser you use, the type of computer, the operating systems, the Internet service providers and other similar information. Cookies are small pieces of information stored on your hard drive, not on the AGL Resources site. Cookies allow us to personalize your experience at the AGL Resources site by automatically gathering information about the areas you visit on our site and about the links you may select from within our site to other areas of the World Wide Web or elsewhere online. Cookies also allow you to store your password (in the event one is necessary), without having to constantly re-enter it. 

We use such information in the aggregate to understand how our users as a group use the services and resources provided on our site. In this way we know which areas of our site are favorites of our users, which areas need improvement, and what technologies are being used so that we may continually improve our site. 

We may also share this aggregate statistical information with our partners, suppliers and other third parties. Most browsers are set to accept cookies. You can set your browser to refuse cookies, or to alert you when cookies are being sent. If you do so, please note that some parts of the AGL Resources site may not work properly. 

**Links To Other Sites and Liability to Third Parties**   
Users will find advertising or other content on our site that provide links to the sites and services of our partners, sponsors, licensors and other third parties. We do not control the content or links that appear on these sites and we are not responsible for the information or links you may find there. These sites and services may have their own privacy policies, or no policy at all. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of any third party site or service before providing them with your personal information. The presence of these links on this website is not intended to imply our endorsement of that site or its goods or services, but to provide a convenient link to relevant sites which are managed by other organizations, companies, or individuals. 

Although we will use all reasonable efforts to safeguard the confidentiality of your personal identification information, transmissions made by means of the Internet cannot be made absolutely secure. AGL Resources will have no liability for disclosure of information due to errors in transmission or unauthorized acts of third parties. 

**Security Policy**   
AGL Resources will make reasonable efforts to keep secure the data you provide us and will take reasonable precautions, such as using a secure server, in an effort to protect your personal identification information from loss, misuse or alteration. Agents or hosting contractors of AGL Resources who have access to your personal identification information in connection with providing services for AGL Resources are required to keep the information confidential and are not permitted to use this information for any other purpose than to carry out the services they are performing for AGL Resources. 

**Choice/Opt-Out**   
If at any time you would like to stop receiving information from us, you can let us know by sending an e-mail stating your preference to [AGLRoptout@aglresources.com](mailto:AGLRoptout@aglresources.com?subject=Inquiry%20from%20AGLResources.com). If you have submitted personal identification information through this website or an interactive advertisement, or if someone else has submitted your personal identification information through this website or interactive advertisement, and you would like to have that information deleted from our marketing databases, please contact us via e-mail at [AGLRprivacy@aglresources.com](mailto:AGLRprivacy@aglresources.com?subject=Inquiry%20from%20AGLResources.com), or send a letter to our AGL Resources Privacy Compliance Coordinator at PO Box 4569, Atlanta Georgia 30302. We will then use reasonable efforts to remove your personal identification information from our files, unless we are entitled to retain it pursuant to an agreement that you have entered into with AGL Resources. You may also contact us through either of the above methods to request the personal identification information that AGL Resources has collected about you through its website or interactive advertisements. AGL Resources will use reasonable efforts to supply you with this information and correct any factual inaccuracies in this information. If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us by email or regular mail as stated above. 

**Transfer of Business Assets**   
As we continue to develop our business, we may be acquired, merge with another business, acquire or buy other businesses or assets. In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred business assets. In such an event, both personal identification and non-personal information will be one of the transferred assets. We will provide you with reasonable notice and an opportunity to opt-out prior to the transfer. 

**Your Acceptance of These Terms**   
By using this site, you accepted our Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to this policy, please do not use the site. Your continued use of the AGL Resources site following the posting of changes to these terms will mean that you accept those changes.
