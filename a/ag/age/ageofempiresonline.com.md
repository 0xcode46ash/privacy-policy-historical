# Xbox Privacy Statement

Xbox Privacy Statement

This privacy statement applies to Xbox products and services ("the Service"), which include Xbox console, Xbox LIVE service, Games for Windows, Windows Mobile Games, Xbox Music, Marketplace, and other products and services that link to this privacy statement. This privacy statement does not apply to other Microsoft products and services that do not link to the Xbox Privacy Statement.

You may find still more information about Microsoft’s commitment to protecting your privacy at <http://www.microsoft.com/privacy>.

User AccountsAccounts

Microsoft account (formerly known as Windows Live ID and Microsoft Passport) is a service that allows you to sign into your Xbox LIVE account plus other Microsoft products, web sites and services, as well as those of select Microsoft partners. When you create a Microsoft account, we ask you to provide certain information. When you sign in to Xbox using your Microsoft account, we collect certain information in order to verify your identity, to protect you from malicious account usage, and to protect the efficiency and security of the Microsoft account service. 

Also, some of the applications on Xbox LIVE are delivered by a partner company, which may require that you create an account and sign-in credentials to use that application. You should read the application’s privacy statement to understand how your data will be managed. None of this separate account credential information will be shared with Microsoft. 

When you create an Xbox LIVE account, we auto-generate a nickname for the account called a gamertag, which is used to identify you when you use the Service. Because the gamertag may be publicly displayed, you should not use personal information in your gamertag.

Kinect and Exercise StatsKinect

Kinect creates a virtual game environment where your body motions and voice can be part of gameplay. Kinect uses the sensor, camera, and microphone to make gameplay possible. Some sensor data may be analyzed by Microsoft after it is anonymized; otherwise it is stored on your Xbox console and not used for other purposes. You control what happens to photographs taken during gameplay and whether voice commands are captured for analysis. You can turn Kinect off at any time. 

When the Kinect sensor is used with certain games and apps, your skeletal movements can be used to estimate exercise stats. You can decide how your stats are managed and whether they are shared.

This information is sent to Microsoft directly from the device using the Xbox Music service.
