# Xbox Privacy Statement

Xbox Privacy Statement

This privacy statement applies to Xbox products and services ("Services"), which include Xbox console versions, the Xbox Live service, Games for Windows Live, Windows Phone Games, Xbox Music, Xbox Store, and other products and services that link to this privacy statement. This privacy statement does not apply to other Microsoft products and services that do not link to the Xbox Privacy Statement.

Please read the summaries below and click "Learn More" for more details. Some products, services or features mentioned in this statement may not be available in all markets. You may find still more information about Microsoft’s commitment to protecting your privacy at <http://www.microsoft.com/privacy>. 

Microsoft accountMicrosoft account

Microsoft account is a service that lets you sign in to Microsoft products, web sites and services, as well as those of select Microsoft partners. When you create a Microsoft account, we ask you to provide certain information. When you sign in to a site or service using your Microsoft account, we collect certain information in order to verify your identity on behalf of the site or service, to protect you from malicious account usage and to protect the efficiency and security of the Microsoft account service.  We also send some of this information to sites and services that you sign in to with your Microsoft account.

We use demographic information – gender, country, age and postal code but not your name or contact information – from your Microsoft account to provide personalized ads to you. **You may opt out of receiving targeted ads from Microsoft Advertising by visiting our** **[ **opt-out page**](https://choice.live.com/AdvertisementChoice/). **

To view additional details about Microsoft account, including how to create and use a Microsoft account, how to edit account information, and how we collect and use information relating to a Microsoft account, please click on Learn More.

Also, some of the applications on Xbox Live are delivered by a partner company, which may require that you create an account and sign-in credentials to use that application. You should read the application’s privacy statement to understand how your data will be managed. None of this separate account credential information will be shared with Microsoft. 

When you create an account (on Xbox Live), we auto-generate a nickname for the account called a gamertag, which is used to identify you when you use the Service. Because the gamertag may be publicly displayed, you should not use personal information in your gamertag.

Information We CollectCollecting Your Information

Microsoft collects many kinds of information in order to operate effectively and provide you the best products, services and experiences we can.

We collect information when you register, sign in and use our sites and services. We also get information from other companies.

We collect this information in a variety of ways, including from web forms, use of Xbox features, technologies like [cookies](http://www.microsoft.com/privacystatement/EN-US/xbox/default.aspx?componentid=pspxboxCookiesModule&view=Description), web logging and software on your computer or other device. 

How We Use Your Personal InformationUsing Your Information

Microsoft uses the information we collect to operate, improve and personalize the products and services we offer.

We also may use the information to communicate with you, for example, informing you about your account and security updates.

And we may use the information to help make the ads you see on our ad-supported services more relevant.

Reasons We Share Your Personal InformationSharing Your Information

We will share your personal information with your consent.  We may also share or disclose information with Microsoft affiliates and vendors; when required by law or to respond to legal process; to protect our customers; to protect lives; to maintain the security of our services; and to protect the rights or property of Microsoft.

Accessing Your Personal InformationAccessing Your Information

You can view or edit your personal information, including billing and account information, privacy settings, online safety and data sharing preferences by accessing [My Account](http://www.xbox.com/accounts "My Account") or through Settings on the Xbox console. You can cancel your account at any time by contacting Customer Support. Go [here](http://support.xbox.com/pages/contact-us.aspx "here") to find contact information for Customer Support.

KinectKinect

Kinect creates a virtual gaming environment where your body motions and voice can be used to control gameplay and to navigate through the Service. Kinect uses an infrared sensor, camera, and microphone to make control possible. You can turn Kinect off at any time.

The camera can be used to sign you in. To do so, it takes an image of your face and then measures distances between key points on your face to create a numeric value that represents only you. No one could look at the numbers and know they represent you.  This authentication information stays on the console and is not shared with anyone. 

You control what happens to photographs taken during gameplay and whether voice commands are captured for analysis. 

When Kinect is used with certain games and apps, your skeletal movements can be used to estimate exercise stats. You can decide how your stats are managed and whether they are shared.

Some game titles may take advantage of a new Xbox capability called expressions. This feature allows you to use your defined facial expressions to control or influence a game. This data does not identify you, stays on the console and is destroyed once your session ends.

Xbox Music, Video, and TVMusic, Video, and TV

To enable a sharing experience on Xbox Music and Xbox Video and help you discover content that may interest you, Microsoft will collect information about what content you play, the length of play, and the rating you give in Xbox Music and Xbox Video. This information is sent to Microsoft directly from the device using the Xbox Music or Xbox Video service. If you are watching Live TV through the Xbox TV app, you can choose whether your personal live TV viewing history is sent to Microsoft. We may also collect TV viewing history from your console in a way that doesn’t identify you or others.

GameDVR and Upload StudioGameDVR

GameDVR is an Xbox One feature that lets you record the game you’re playing, including when you’re playing with other people in your house or multiplayer on Xbox Live.

When playing multiplayer on Xbox Live, any player in that session can use GameDVR to record their view of the gameplay taking place in that session.  The recording may capture your in-game character and gamertag in the game clips created by other players in the gameplay session. No audio chat is recorded in these game clips. 

Xbox Location and SmartGlassLocation and SmartGlass

Xbox console and web sites use your IP address to provide the Service. If you allow an Xbox application on Windows Phone to access your location, the approximate location of your phone may be sent periodically to Microsoft in order to award achievements, provide in-game rewards or customize gameplay. For example, games may use your location to award an achievement based on the distance traveled between game sessions. Xbox applications will only collect and store the approximate location of your phone as necessary for these purposes. 

Xbox SmartGlass is an application that lets you use a phone or tablet to enhance games and entertainment experiences on the Xbox console.  If you choose to download and use Xbox SmartGlass, it will collect only device and usage data (for example, device type and the game or application you are controlling) that cannot be used to identify you.

Xbox SocialSocial

If you are an Xbox Live subscriber, your gamertag and statistics such as high scores will be visible to other subscribers through the Xbox Live service, and may be visible to the general public, on properties associated with the service (for example, within a game, on the web and/or on the Windows Phone).

Children and Parental ConsentChildren

If you have children who use the Service, you can set up child accounts during account creation. Children 17 and younger cannot create an account for the Service without parental consent. The owner of the associated parent account must consent to the collection of information about the child. As a parent you can choose privacy settings based on your comfort level for each child account.

Display of AdvertisingAdvertising

Most of the online advertisements on Microsoft sites and services are displayed by Microsoft Advertising. When we display online advertisements to you, we will place one or more [cookies](http://www.microsoft.com/privacystatement/EN-US/Core/default.aspx?componentid=pspCookiesModule&view=Description) in order to recognize your computer when we display an ad to you. Over time, we may gather information from the sites where we serve ads and use the information to help provide more relevant ads. 

**You may opt out of receiving targeted ads from Microsoft Advertising by visiting our**[ **opt-out page**](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759) **.**
