### Our Provision of Services to our Clients

AgilOne is a provider of predictive customer intelligence solutions. Our Services include a data storage and computational platform, reporting and business intelligence portal, predictive engine, and integrated list execution solution. Some of our products are offered as application Services, meaning that we host a software application that our clients access via the worldwide web. Each client understands that in the course of providing our Services to it, we collect or receive information about the individual to whom our client directs its marketing messages. Some of the information that we collect and store on our client’s behalf is Personally Identifiable Information. AgilOne may in the course of providing its Services collect data from the internet using web beacon or Stat One. AgilOne may also purchase third party data on the behalf of its client for use by such client.

As between AgilOne and our client, all of the information we receive from our client belongs to our client and not to us. We may use such information only as provided in our written agreement with the individual client. While our specific responsibilities regarding such information are found in these written agreements, we do not allow individual information collected and stored for one client to be accessed or used by any other AgilOne client (or by AgilOne on our own behalf). We reserve a limited right to use our client’s information to compile aggregated statistics, which we use to report such facts as how many emails we have delivered. However, we do not disclose this information in such a way as to enable anyone to identify a client or any individual. Our client agreements also permit us to disclose any information if required by law or court order.

In our client agreements, we require each client to abide by all laws, rules and regulations that are applicable to the Customer’s use of our Services and we promise each client that we will do the same with respect to our provision of Services. We ask each client to post a privacy policy that covers the client’s use of our Services. We also request the client to acquire and maintain all rights that allow us to provide the Services, such as to receive the information that we collect and store on the client’s behalf.

Our Services may use Cookies or other technologies to help our client better analyze their marketing efforts. The technologies we use are often correlated with information that can identify an individual. As with the other information we maintain and process for each of our clients, this information is not used by us except as described above and is not shared with other AgilOne clients.

AgilOne is not responsible for its client’s own privacy policies and makes no representations about their accuracy. If you have questions about our client’s practices, we recommend you check their privacy policies and/or contact them directly.
