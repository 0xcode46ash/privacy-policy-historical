## 1\. Notice

### What information we collect

During the course of your relationship with us, we may collect personal information to enable you to order products or services, download software updates, make requests, and register for customized communications programs. We may collect such personal information as your name, contact and billing information, transaction and credit card information. To tailor our subsequent communications to you and improve our products and services, we may ask you to provide information regarding your personal or professional interests, demographics, experience with our products and contact preferences.  Personal information may be required to determine access eligibility for certain restricted parts of our site.  Data collected on-line may be combined with information provided off-line; for example, information provided via hard-copy form while attending an Agilent-sponsored seminar.

### How we use the information

Agilent uses your personal information to better understand your needs and provide you with better service. Specifically, we use your personal information to help you complete a transaction, to communicate back to you, provide updates on service and benefits, and to personalize our web sites and communications with you. Credit card numbers are used only for payment processing and are not retained for other purposes.  From time to time, we may also use your information to contact you for market research or to provide you with marketing information we think would be of particular interest. We will always give you the opportunity to opt-out of receiving such contact. If you would like to read more about how to opt-out, please follow the directions given below in the "Choice" section of this document.

## 2\. Choice 

Agilent will not use or share your personal information in ways unrelated to the ones described above without first notifying you and offering a choice. We will also provide you the opportunity to let us know if you wish to opt-out at any time of certain or all contacts from Agilent, and we will do everything we can to honor such requests. This choice may be offered at the bottom of our on-line or off-line communications to you as well as on many of our web registration pages. If you have any difficulty exercising your choices, please send your request to [privacy_advocate@agilent.com](mailto:privacy_advocate@agilent.com)

Your permission will always be secured first, should we ever decide to share your personal information with third parties that are not acting on our behalf and governed by our privacy policy. 

## 3\. Onward Transfer

### Whom we share the information with

Agilent does not sell, rent, or lease your personal information to others. Unless we have your permission or are required by law, we only share your personal information with other Agilent entities or distributors of Agilent products and services or service providers (a shipper, credit card processor, etc.) who are acting on our behalf for the uses described above. Such Agilent entities and business partners are required to keep this data confidential and may not use it for any purpose other than to carry out the services they are performing for Agilent.

Subject to your permission or as permitted by law, the personal information that you provide to us may be transferred across state or country borders to consolidate data storage or simplify information management. 

However, Agilent may disclose your personal information (i) if we are required to do so by law; (ii) if we believe that it is necessary to protect and defend the rights of Agilent; or (iii) in order to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or government inquiry. 

## 4\. Access and Accuracy

Agilent strives to keep your personal information accurate. We will provide you reasonable access to personal information you provided to Agilent and reasonable ability to review and correct it or ask for deletion, as applicable. To protect your privacy and security, we will also take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting you access or enabling you to make corrections. To access your personal information, return to the web page where you originally entered it and follow the instructions on that web page. If you cannot access your information on the web page, please telephone the nearest Agilent Call Center for assistance, or send your request to [privacy_advocate@agilent.com](mailto:privacy_advocate@agilent.com)

We will respond to your request for access within 30 days. 

## 5\. Security

Agilent is committed to ensuring the security of your personal information. To prevent unauthorized access or disclosure, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the appropriate use of personal information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic and organizational measures to safeguard and secure it. When you provide sensitive information (such as a credit card number) the information is encrypted using secure socket layer technology (SSL). 

## 6\. Tailoring E-Mail Communications and Web Experiences

On occasions Agilent may employ technologies that enable us to review which recipients have opened our e-mail communications and which links they have accessed in the message. This helps us to tailor our communications in our attempts to send you the most relevant information, as local laws and your preferences and permissions allow. As a registered user, we may also monitor your web browsing session while you are logged-in to Agilent.com. In this way we will try to improve our web site through personalization to better meet your needs. 

## 7\. How Agilent Uses Cookies

A cookie is a piece of information either stored temporarily in your browser's memory space (session cookie) or placed on your computer's hard drive (stored cookie). Cookies allow a web application to respond to you as an individual, but without the need to identify you explicitly. Session cookies are destroyed when you terminate your browsing session by shutting down your browser. Stored cookies often have a predetermined expiration date after which they disappear from your hard drive. Cookies can be removed explicitly through functionality built into most web browsers. You may also set your web browser (e.g. Microsoft Internet Explorer or Netscape Navigator) to notify you of cookie placement requests, to ask for permission to accept them, or to decline cookies completely. 

### Adjusting Browser Cookie Settings

For information on how to adjust your browser regarding cookies, please visit:

Microsoft Internet Explorer: [http://www.microsoft.com/info/cookies.htm](http://www.home.agilent.com/agilent/disclaimer.jspx?lc=eng&cc=US&exturl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Finfo%2Fcookies.htm&exttxt=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Finfo%2Fcookies.htm)

Netscape Navigator: [http://wp.netscape.com/legal_notices/cookies.html](http://www.home.agilent.com/agilent/disclaimer.jspx?lc=eng&cc=US&exturl=http%3A%2F%2Fwp.netscape.com%2Flegal_notices%2Fcookies.html&exttxt=http%3A%2F%2Fwp.netscape.com%2Flegal_notices%2Fcookies.html)

### Cookie Usage

On occasions Agilent may use cookies (which may be provided by a third party operating on our behalf) to help us analyze web traffic or to improve your web navigation experience. To facilitate the analysis, an ID is assigned to help us uniquely identify you each time you return to our web site. One of the major concerns about stored cookies is the fear that they contain personal information and information identifying you that could be accessed by other web sites. Agilent only stores a randomly chosen unique ID number and a context, both of which are meaningless to others but help us to identify you.

By gathering and remembering information about your preferences, the web application can: 

  * Tailor its operation to your needs, likes and dislikes
  * Provide an automated log-in process as a convenience for previously registered customers. This insures that you will be accurately identified and linked with your registration data.
  * Be placed on your computer to ensure you are not surveyed multiple times during your visit(s) to an Agilent web site. This cookie has a limited life span and will not personally identify you.



Cookies help us provide a better web experience by letting us monitor what's working and what isn't through site traffic analysis. Agilent wants to be sure you understand that accepting a cookie in no way gives us access to your computer or any personal information about you, other than the data you choose to share with us. This practice is strictly enforced. While acknowledging the concerns that some visitors have about cookie usage, we believe that the benefit our webpage visitors gain from the use of cookies is worthwhile.
