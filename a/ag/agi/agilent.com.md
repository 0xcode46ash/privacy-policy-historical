# Agilent | Privacy

[](http://www.bbbonline.org/cks.asp?id=4182000121031)

At Agilent Technologies, customers are our most valuable asset. We recognize that building a long-term business relationship with you depends a great deal on trust. This trust begins with our commitment to respecting as well as protecting your privacy. 

An integral part of this commitment is our participation in the BBBOnLine Privacy Program. We proudly display the BBBOnLine Privacy Seal. Agilent privacy practices are also self-certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce Safe Harbor Program. [More about BBBOnline](http://www.bbbonline.org/cks.asp?id=4182000121031)

We've structured our web sites so that, in general, you can visit Agilent on the Web without identifying yourself or revealing any personal information. Once you choose to provide us personally identifiable information (name, address, e-mail address, phone number, etc.) you can be assured that it will only be used to support your customer relationship with Agilent. 

Our privacy statement covers six main areas: Notice, Choice, Access & Accuracy, Onward Transfer, Security, and Oversight/Enforcement. Please keep in mind that Agilent's privacy practices may vary as required by local laws and policies. 

## 1\. Notice 

Agilent provides this Online Privacy Statement to make you aware of our privacy practices and of the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used. To make this notice easy to find, we make it available on our homepage and from the bottom of every Agilent.com and its subsidiaries' web pages. 

### What information we collect 

On some Agilent web sites, you can order products or services, download software updates, make requests, and register to receive materials. The types of personal information collected at these pages are name, contact and billing information, transaction, and credit card information. In order to tailor our subsequent communications to you and continuously improve our products and services (including registration), we may also ask you to provide us with information regarding your personal or professional interests, demographics, experience with our products, and contact preferences. Data collected online may also be combined with information you provide when you register your ownership of Agilent products. 

### How we use the information 

Agilent uses your information to better understand your needs and provide you with better service. Specifically, we use your information to help you complete a transaction, to communicate back to you, to update you on service and benefits, and to personalize our web sites for you. Credit card numbers are used only for payment processing and are not retained for other purposes. 

From time to time, we may also use your information to contact you for market research or to provide you with marketing information we think would be of particular interest. At a minimum, we will always give you the opportunity to opt-out of receiving such contact. Please follow the opt-out directions given below in the "Choice" section of this document. In addition, we will also follow local requirements, such as allowing you to opt-in before receiving unsolicited contact, where applicable. 

### Whom we share the information with

Agilent will not sell, rent, or lease your personally identifiable information to others. Unless we have your permission or are required by law, we will only share the personal data you provide online with other Agilent entities and/or business partners who are acting on our behalf for the uses described above. Such Agilent entities and/or business partners are governed by our privacy policies with respect to the use of this data and are bound by the appropriate confidentiality agreements. 

## 2\. Choice 

Agilent will not use or share the personally identifiable information provided to us online in ways unrelated to the ones described above without first letting you know and offering you a choice. We will also provide you the opportunity to let us know if you wish to opt-out of partial or all contact from Agilent and we will do everything we can to honor such requests. This choice may be offered at the bottom of on-line or off-line communications from us as well as on many of our web registration pages. If you have any difficulty exercising your choices, please send your request to [privacy_advocate@agilent.com.](mailto:privacy_advocate@agilent.com)

Your permission will always be secured first, should we ever decide to share your information with third parties that are not acting on our behalf and governed by our privacy policy. 

## 3\. Onward Transfer 

The personal information that you provide to us may be transferred within Agilent across state or country borders.  This may be done to consolidate data storage and simplify the management of customer information.  Please read the information in the Choice and Security sections regarding the practices that cover such transfers. 

## 4\. Access & Accuracy

Agilent strives to keep your personally identifiable information accurate. We will provide you with access to your information, including making every effort to provide you with online access to your registration data so that you may review, update or correct your information at the Agilent site where it was submitted. To protect your privacy and security, we will also take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting you access or enabling you to make corrections. To access your individually identifiable information, return to the web page where you originally entered it and follow the instructions on that web page. If for some reason you cannot access your information on the web page, please telephone the nearest Agilent Call Center for assistance. You can also send your request to [privacy_advocate@agilent.com.](mailto:privacy_advocate@agilent.com)

## 5\. Security

To prevent unauthorized access or disclosure, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the appropriate use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online. We use encryption when collecting or transferring sensitive data such as credit card information. 

## 6\. Oversight/Enforcement

Two integral parts of the BBBOnLine program are a third party oversight function and a dispute resolution process.

## Additional Information

### Links to Third Party Web Sites

Links to third party web sites are provided solely as a convenience to you. If you use these links, you will leave the Agilent site. Agilent has not reviewed all of these third party sites and does not control and is not responsible for any of these sites, their content or their privacy policies. Thus, Agilent does not endorse or make any representations about them, or any information, software or other products or materials found there, or any results that may be obtained from using them. If you decide to access any of the third party sites linked to this site, you do this entirely at your own risk. 

### How Agilent Uses Cookies

A cookie is a piece of information either stored temporarily in your browser's memory space (session cookie) or placed on your computer's hard drive (stored cookie). Many stored cookies also have a predetermined expiration date after which they disappear from your hard drive or they can be removed explicitly through functionality built into most web browsers. You may set your web browser (e.g. Microsoft Internet Explorer or Netscape Navigator) to notify you of cookie placement requests, ask for permission to accept them, or decline cookies completely. 

### Session Cookies

Session cookies are used to help us analyze web traffic or to improve your web navigation experience by tracking a unique ID for that particular web site session only which helps us identify you each time you return to our web site during a browsing session. These cookies are destroyed when you terminate your browsing session by shutting down your browser. Session cookies allow a web application to respond to you as an individual, but without the need to identify you explicitly. 

### Stored Cookies

By gathering and remembering information about your preferences, the web application can tailor its operation to your needs, likes and dislikes. Certain Agilent web sites use cookies to provide an automated login process as a convenience for previously registered customers. This insures that you will be accurately identified and linked with your registration data. A cookie may also be placed on your computer to ensure you are not surveyed multiple times during your visit(s) to an Agilent web site. This cookie has a limited life span and will not personally identify you. 

One of the major concerns about stored cookies is the fear that they contain personal data and information identifying you that could be accessed by other web sites. Agilent only stores a randomly chosen unique ID number and a context, both of which are meaningless to others but help us identify you in the context of the specific web functionality you are accessing. 

Overall, cookies help us give you a better web site to use, by letting us monitor what's working and what isn't through site traffic analysis. Agilent wants to be sure you understand that accepting a cookie in no way gives us access to your computer or any personal information about you, other than the data you chose to share with us. This practice is strictly enforced. We know that a lot of people have concerns about cookies, but in talking with many of our customers, we believe that the benefit we both gain from their proper use is worthwhile. We value the relationships we have with our customers, so we respect these concerns. Agilent works to continuously improve the your Agilent web experience and our data privacy policies and practices.
