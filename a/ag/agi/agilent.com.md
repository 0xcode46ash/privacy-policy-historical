_This statement was last revised on August 12, 2011._

Agilent Technologies, Inc. and its subsidiaries (also referred to in this document as "Agilent Technologies", "Agilent" or “we”) provides this Privacy Statement to make you aware of our privacy practices and the choices you can make about how your personal information is collected and used, both on-line and off-line. To make this notice easy to access, it is available on the bottom of every Agilent web page.

Customers are Agilent's most valuable asset. We recognize that building a long-term business relationship with you depends a great deal on trust. This trust begins with our commitment to respecting as well as protecting your privacy.

To show our commitment to privacy, we have entered into three voluntary data privacy programs: the [US-EU Safe Harbor, U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor _ _](http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/ "This link takes you outside Agilent.com") and [TRUSTe _ _](http://www.truste.org/ "This link takes you outside Agilent.com").

Agilent complies with the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Framework and the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information from European Union member countries and Switzerland.

##  1\. Notice

###  What information we collect

We may collect such personal information as your name, e-mail address, contact and billing information, transaction and credit card information.

Through your in-person communications and/or on-line interactions with Agilent, we may ask you to provide information regarding your personal or professional interests, demographics, experience with our products and contact preferences. In order to best serve you, we may correlate the information you provide to us through different communications and contact channels, such as data collected on-line may be combined with information provided off-line; for example, information provided via hard-copy form while attending an Agilent-sponsored seminar.

In addition, personal information will be required to determine access eligibility for certain restricted parts of our site.

We are committed to keeping your personal data only as long as required to respond to your request, provide you with the product/service you are interested in, or for the time period necessary to fulfill our own legal obligations.

##  5\. Security

Agilent is committed to ensuring the security of your personal information. To prevent unauthorized access or disclosure, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the appropriate use of personal information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic and organizational measures to safeguard and secure it. When you provide sensitive information (such as a credit card number) the information is encrypted using secure socket layer technology (SSL).

##  6\. Tailoring E-Mail Communications and Web Experiences

Agilent may employ technologies, such as web-tracking tools (described in section “7. How Agilent Uses Cookies”), designed for website session analysis and profiling of the users of our website. Such technologies enable us to optimize our website content and tailor it and other communications to you.

##  7\. How Agilent Uses Cookies

**Types of data collected through cookies and purposes of cookies’ use**

A cookie is a piece of information either stored temporarily (session cookie) or placed on your computer's hard drive (stored cookie). The main purpose of a cookie is to allow a web server to identify a user and serve up customized web pages and/or login information to the user's web browser when revisiting a web page.

We may use session and stored cookies (which may be provided by a third party operating on our behalf) to help us analyze web traffic or to improve your web navigation experience. To facilitate the analysis, an ID is assigned to help us uniquely identify you each time you return to our web site. One of the major concerns about stored cookies is the fear that they contain personal information and information identifying you that could be accessed by other web sites. No personal information stored in Agilent cookies can be accessed by other websites.

The cookies help you avoid entering identification details each time you visit our website or repeatedly type the same information you are looking for on our website (search terms, key words, names of products, etc.). Cookies help us promptly display the information you need and other information which we consider may be of interest to you. 

**Cookie and Clear gif usage and your choices about tracking technologies**

By gathering and remembering information about your website preferences through cookies we can provide a better web and marketing experience. Examples include, but are not limited to:

  * Tailor its operation to your needs, likes and dislikes 
  * Provide an automated log-in process as a convenience for previously registered customers. This insures that you will be accurately identified and linked with your registration data. 
  * Be placed on your computer to ensure you are not surveyed multiple times during your visit(s) to an Agilent web site. This cookie has a limited life span and will not personally identify you.



Website analysis operated through the cookies help us provide a better web experience by letting us monitor what is working and what is not. Agilent wants to be sure you understand that accepting a cookie in no way gives us access to your computer or any personal information about you, other than the data you choose to share with us. This practice is strictly enforced in Agilent. While acknowledging the concerns that some visitors have about cookie usage, we believe that the benefit our webpage visitors gain from the use of cookies is worthwhile.

As a user you have the ability to accept or decline the use of cookies. Agilent tries to indicate data tracking through cookies and strives to find ways to display you relevant information and provide consent options when it dynamically interacts with you (e.g. on “sign-in” session or upon your registration on certain websites).

Cookies can be removed explicitly through functionality built into most web browsers. You may also set your web browser (e.g. Microsoft Internet Explorer or Netscape Navigator) to notify you of cookie placement requests, to ask for permission to accept them, or to decline cookies completely.

**Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs)**

We may also employ Clear Gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We also may use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns. For this reason, clear gifs may be tied to personally- identifiable information.
