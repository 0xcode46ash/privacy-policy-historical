##  _Privacy and Data Protection Act 2014_  (Vic): Personal information

In this privacy statement the term 'personal information' has the meaning provided in section 3 of the  _Privacy and Data Protection Act 2014_  (Vic).

Personal information is information or an opinion that is recorded in any form, whether true or not, about an individual whose identity is apparent or can reasonably be ascertained.

This Act is the legislation that regulates our collection and handling of personal information.

## Collection of personal information
