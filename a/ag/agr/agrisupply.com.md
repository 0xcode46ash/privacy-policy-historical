**Our eComm Provider's Statement:** _"We use 3DES encryption on both the credit card number and expiration date. When a customer enters a credit card number (through SSL encryption) the web page passes that number to a procedure that encrypts it before putting it into the database. The credit card number is decrypted only when the client downloads their orders through the admin tool. It is never decrypted into a database field. We use SSL, SFTP or file encryption when transferring credit card data to the client's fulfillment system. The encrypted credit card data is wiped from our database after 5 days. We retain just the first digit and last 4 digits of the card# after 5 days."_
