#### ​​About this policy 

The purpose of this privacy policy is to:

  * clearly communicate the personal information handling practices of the Department of Agriculture and Water Resources
  * enhance the transparency of the department’s operations, and
  * give individuals a better and more complete understanding of the sort of personal information the department holds, and the way we handle that information.



This condensed privacy policy ​has been developed to follow the ‘layered policy’ format, which means that it offers layers of greater or lesser detail so people can read as much as they wish and find what they need. This document provides you with a succinct overview of how we handle your personal information. Our complete privacy policy​​ can be accessed on our website.

If you wish to make any comments or suggestions about the privacy policy, you can do so by contacting the privacy team in the Office of the General Counsel within the department via:

Email: [Privacy](mailto:privacy@agriculture.gov.au)  
Phone: (02) 6272 3933  
Mail: Privacy, Department of Agriculture and Water Resources, PO Box 858, Canberra ACT 2601.

Any comments and/or suggestions will be reviewed and considered by the department’s privacy officers.

If you would like to request the privacy policy be made available in an alternate format or language, such as for the vision impaired, or for those from non-english speaking backgrounds, please also contact the privacy team. Reasonable steps will be taken to provide alternate access.

This privacy policy is reviewed and updated annually. Changes will be advertised via the ‘[Latest News](https://web.archive.org/)’ window on the department’s website.

The privacy policy was last reviewed in March 2014.

#### Our obligations under the Privacy Act

This privacy policy sets out how we comply with our obligations under the [ Priva​cy Act 1988](https://www.legislation.gov.au/Series/C2004A03712) (Privacy Act). As an Australian Government agency, we are bound by the Australian Privacy Principles (APP) in the Privacy Act which regulate how government agencies collect, use, store and disclose personal information, and how individuals may access and correct personal information held about them.

##### Personal information

Personal information is defined in s 6(1) of the Privacy Act as ‘information or an opinion about an identified individual, or an individual who is reasonably identifiable:

  * whether the information or opinion is true or not, and
  * whether the information or opinion is recorded in a material form or not’.



What constitutes personal information will vary, depending on whether an individual can be identified or is reasonably identifiable in the particular circumstances. For example, personal information could include:

  * a name or address
  * bank account details
  * photos or videos
  * information about an individual’s mannerisms, their opinions or where they work.



Note: information does not have to include an individual’s name to be personal information. For example, in some cases, a date of birth and post code may be enough to identify a person.

##### Sensitive information

Sensitive information is a subset of personal information with additional requirements under the Privacy Act.

Sensitive information is defined in the Privacy Act as information or an opinion about an individual’s racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, membership of a political association, religious beliefs or affiliations, philosophical beliefs, membership of a professional or trade association, membership of a trade union, sexual preferences or practices, or criminal record that is also personal information; health information about an individual, genetic information about an individual, biometric information that is to be used for the purpose of automated biometric verification/identification and biometric templates.

#### How the department collects and holds your personal information

##### How the department collects your personal information

When the department collects personal information about you, in the majority of cases, we will collect this information directly from you. However, there may be times where the department may collect personal information from your agent or a third party. If this occurs, such collection will be in accordance with the APPs.

#### The purposes for which the department collects, holds, uses and discloses your personal information

The purpose for the department collecting your personal information is important as it restricts how the department can use and disclose your personal information, unless an exception in the Privacy Act applies. Unless an exception applies, the department will:

  * only use or disclose your personal information for the purpose it was collected, and
  * notify you of this purpose at the time of collection, or as soon as practicable after collection.



The department will only use or disclose your personal information for another purpose where it is able to do so in accordance with the Privacy Act.

There are a number of general purposes for which the department may collect, hold, use and disclose your personal information.

#### How to access and seek correction of your personal information

Individuals have a right to request access to their personal information and to request its correction if it is inaccurate, out of date, incomplete, irrelevant or misleading.

If you are an external client or stakeholder you should contact the relevant business area within the department, in writing, for access to or correction of your personal information. For example, applicants for a grant program should first contact the program administrator via email or letter. If you do not know which area of the department holds your personal information you can contact the department’s switch on 02 6272 3933. Alternatively, you can use the ‘[contact us](https://web.archive.org/about/contactus)’ link on the department’s website.

Current and former departmental employees who wish to gain access to, or correct their personal information need to contact the People Services Branch (HR Assist) in the first instance. HR Assist can be contacted on 02 6272 3933 or via email at [HRAssist](mailto:HRAssist@agriculture.gov.au).

#### How you can complain about the treatment of your personal information and how the complaint will be handled

You can make a complaint if you believe the department has breached the APPs or mishandled your personal information.

Privacy breaches can be caused by a variety of factors, affect different types of personal information and give rise to a range of actual or potential harm to individuals, agencies and organisations. Consequently, there is no single way of responding to a privacy breach. Each breach will need to be dealt with on a case-by-case basis. All complaints and alleged breaches will be investigated by a privacy officer and the complainant will be advised of the outcome.

The department’s privacy officers will investigate:

  * concerns that the personal information contained in a record of a client, stakeholder or departmental officer has been mishandled
  * any complaints and/or allegations about a breach of the APPs, and
  * all privacy-related matters referred from the Privacy Commissioner within the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC).



In the first instance, any privacy concerns or complaints should be reported to the department’s privacy team. This can be done by:

Phone: 02 6272 3933  
Email: [Privacy](mailto:privacy@agriculture.gov.au)  
Mail: Privacy, Department of Agriculture and Water Resources, PO BOX 858, Canberra ACT 2601.

If you are unhappy with the department’s response or reply, you also have the option of contacting the Privacy Commissioner within the OAIC. The Privacy Commissioner can be contacted on:

Phone: 1300 363 992  
Email: [Enquiries](mailto:enquiries@oaic.gov.au)  
Mail: OAIC, GPO Box 5218 Sydney NSW 2001.
