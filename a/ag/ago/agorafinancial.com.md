PRIVACY POLICY -- IMPORTANT -- PLEASE READ

We at  _Agora Financial_  take your privacy very seriously.

Personal Information

We will never ask you for personal information--your credit card number, for example--except when you place an order. At that time, we will provide a secure (SSL, encrypted) connection and require you to submit only the information needed to complete and fulfill your order. Only authorized employees of Agora, Inc. (our parent company) will have access to this information. _Agora_ will not sell or rent this information to anyone, nor share it in any other way, unless required to by a law enforcement agency that takes the proper steps to require it. Please note that "personal information" does not include your mailing address. See  **Mailing Address, below.**

Mailing Address

When you give us your mailing address, _Agora_ will use this information to fulfill your order or subscription and to send you information on other products that may suit your interests. If you don't want **Agora** to send you this other information, please contact our customer service department:

Cookies

Cookies are small files placed on your computer by a web page when you visit it. They can be used to store all sorts of useful information to make your next visit easier and more convenient, but some people are uncomfortable not knowing what information is in a cookie.

The _Agora Financial_  web site uses cookies only to compile statistics on the use of the various pages on our site (how many people visit each page and that sort of thing). We do not store or collect any personally identifiable information.

Discussion Board

If you choose to participate on Agora Financial's Discussion Board, you do so at your own risk.

You must submit a name to post a message to the Discussion Board, but it doesn't have to be your real name. Using your real name or e-mail address when you post is entirely voluntary. In fact, it's just not a good idea. Agora does not collect e-mail addresses from the Discussion Board, but there is nothing to prevent an unscrupulous person or company from doing so and then using that address to send you unwanted e-mail (spam).

Aliases are completely acceptable--but only as long as they are unique and not meant to impersonate another person (for example, "Bill Bonner" is not acceptable). If you feel that someone is impersonating you on our Discussion Board, please contact  reserve@agorafinancial.com. We will take whatever steps we deem necessary, possibly including legal action, to correct the matter.

We reserve the right to remove any messages from the board for any reason whatsoever. We prohibit or strongly discourage: advertisements to buy or sell securities, promotions and advertisements of any type and links thereto, impersonating another person, unnecessary profanity, ludicrous and thoroughly discredited conspiracy theories, and personal attacks. However, we cannot be held responsible for any claims made on our Discussion Board.

Enjoy the ride!

Aug. 24, 410… and Nov. 14, 2005. They may sound like random dates, but both are particularly important to remember if you want to make good investment choices today.Of course, unless you’re a scholar, the first date probably doesn’t mean anything to you. But to the ancient world, it meant everything. Some might consider it the first Day of Infamy — a day everything changed.
