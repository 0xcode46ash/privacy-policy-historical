# Privacy

## We at Agora Financial take your privacy very seriously!

**Email Address**

When you subscribe to Agora Financial via email, your email address is placed in a database and used to send your issues of Agora Financial publications. We will not sell or rent your email address to any company outside of our parent company of Agora, Inc. You can remove your address from our email list by following the instructions at the end of every email we send.

Any email you send to Agora Financial is considered confidential unless you tell us otherwise. We will not add your name to our email list without your permission. If your inquiry is about an order or subscription, Agora’s Customer Service staff will ask you to verify your identity by confirming information already in your record.

**Spam**

If you believe that _Agora Financial_ has sent you unsolicited commercial e-mail (spam), please send an e-mail to [customerservice@agorafinancial.com](mailto:customerservice@agorafinancial.com).

**Personal Information**

We will never ask you for personal information — your credit card number, for example — except when you place an order. At that time, we will provide a secure (SSL, encrypted) connection and require you to submit only the information needed to complete and fulfill your order. Only authorized employees of Agora Inc. (our parent company) will have access to this information. Agora will not sell or rent this information  to any company outside of our parent company of Agora, Inc. However, Agora will share information if required by law or regulations, or to respond to a subpoena, search warrant or other lawful request for information received by us. Please note that “personal information” does not include your mailing address. See “Mailing Address,” below.

**Mailing Address**

When you give us your mailing address, Agora will use this information to fulfill your order or subscription and to send you information on other products that may suit your interests. If you don’t want Agora to send you this other information, please contact our Customer Service department:
