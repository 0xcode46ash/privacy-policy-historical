Your privacy is important to us, be assured that we are doing our very best to protect it and avoid any misuse or abuse of your personal data. This Policy explains how your personal information is collected, used, and disclosed by AgoraPulse and its Affiliates.

You are probably seeing this privacy policy because you have installed, or are about to install, a Facebook application brought to you by one of our Affiliate.

Each Affiliate is bound by this Privacy Policy and commits to respect your privacy as well as we do.

The information we collect will help us and our Affiliate to target messages that are really of interest to you.
