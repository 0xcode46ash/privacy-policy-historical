## The "Find an Aggie" Tool (Online Directory of Former Students): 

**  
Accessibility**

The "Find an Aggie" tool is accessible only to Former Students. Your personal information is kept in a secure database that is only accessible to The Association staff. After registering with AggieNetwork.com you have the ability to set your own privacy settings for the information that is displayed in the Online Directory. If the suppression does not meet your requirements, you can email [Web@AggieNetwork.com](mailto:Web@AggieNetwork.com) and we will be glad to ensure that your information is not displayed anywhere on AggieNetwork.com. All requests made to The Online Directory are encrypted with SSL level encryption. 

 **Information Shared**

The information displayed in the Online Directory contains fields such as your name, address, zip code, phone number, employer, and other statistics regarding you. By default, your phone number, and email address are hidden.  The Association of Former Student database is not sold or made available for commericial solicitation or political purposes. It is maintained by The Association of Former Students at Texas A&M University. 

**Record Limit**

In order to ensure that the database is not compromised by any third party, we have limited the basic results returned to 2000 records (detailed results are limited to 500 per day). This limits one person from downloading the entire directory to their computer and then selling the list to advertising companies. This also helps keep the load speed of AggieNetwork.com at a reasonable level. 

**Information Use**

The "Find an Aggie" tool is not intended for marketing or political purposes. If The Association has reason to believe that any user is utilizing the Directory for unauthorized purposes, The Association will terminate that users access to the Directory immediately.

If you do not want Former Students to tbe able to contact you via email through our site, you can change your email address to "Private" in your account settings.

The Association will use only use this email to send official correspondence which includes the E-Newsletter. This is a monthly newsletter that is sent to all former students with the intent of keeping them up to date with Association activities and Texas A&M news. 

The Association will also send out approved emails on behalf of organizations it recognizes. These include Texas A&M, A&M Clubs, Classes and some other groups such as colleges. These emails are targeted to a specific audience.

**Links**

This Web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that we, The Association of Former Students, are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites.

##  Security 

This Web site takes every precaution to protect our users’ information. When users submit sensitive information via the Web site, their information is protected both online and off-line. 

When our registration/donation form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number), that information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry - **SSL** . While on a secure page, such as our donation form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when users are just ‘surfing’.

While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect user-information off-line. All of our users’ information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, records processing and our web team) are granted access to personally identifiable information. Finally, the servers that store personally identifiable information are in a secure environment, in a locked facility.

If users have any questions about the security at our Web site, users can send an email to [Web@AggieNetwork.com](mailto:Web@AggieNetwork.com). 

##  Correcting/Updating/Deleting/Deactivating Personal Information 

If a user’s personally identifiable information changes (such as zip code, phone, email or postal address), or if a user no longer desires our service, we provide a way to correct, update or delete/deactivate users’ personally identifiable information. This can be done by logging in and clicking "Your Aggie Profile" link at the top right of each page, or by emailing our Web Team at [Web@AggieNetwork.com](mailto:Web@AggieNetwork.com), by phone at (979) 845-7514 or by mail at :

##  Notification of Changes 

If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement, the homepage, and other places we deem appropriate so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected. 

If, however, we are going to use users’ personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection we will notify users via email. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner. However, if users have opted out of all communication with the site, or deleted/deactivated their account, then they will not be contacted, nor will their personal information be used in this new manner. In addition, if we make any material changes in our privacy practices that do not affect user information already stored in our database, we will post a prominent notice on our Web site notifying users of the change. In some cases where we post a notice we will also email users, who have opted to receive communications from us, notifying them of the changes in our privacy practices.
