("AIG") and its subsidiaries and affiliates (individually, an "AIG Company" and collectively "AIG Companies", "we" or "us") located in the United States of America which provide and collect information via the Website. Our data collection and use policies with respect to visitors to the Website are set forth in this statement ("Policy"). By using this Website, you signify your acceptance of this Policy.

     **WHAT IS "PERSONAL INFORMATION"?**

     The term "personal information" means any information that can be used to identify or contact a specific individual, such as a name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, or policy or claim number. The term "non-personal information" means information that does not allow us to identify or contact a specific individual, such as demographic information, purchase categories (e.g., life insurance), and technical data gathered through a Web browser, such as the particular browser used to access the Website, or through cookies and other similar technologies. The term "IP address" means a number that is automatically assigned to the computer that a visitor to the Website is using by the visitor's Internet Service Provider (ISP).  

     **WHAT TYPES OF PERSONAL INFORMATION DO AIG AND AIG COMPANIES COLLECT ON THE WEBSITE?**

     We collect various types of personal information from visitors to the Website. For instance, we may offer visitors the opportunity to sign up to become a member of the Website ("Member"), by providing their e-mail address, and responding to other contact and product-related questions we may ask from time to time, in order to receive special e-mail offers and promotions available to Members. 

     AIG and AIG Companies also collect personal information through "contact us" forms, such as first name, last name, e-mail address, telephone number, policy number and any other personal information you include in a question or comment. 

     Depending on your relationship with us (for example, as a consumer policyholder; non-policyholder insured or claimant; witness; commercial broker or appointed representative; or other person relating to our businesses), certain AIG Companies may through other means collect other personal information, including sensitive personal information, such as social security numbers and health information, in the course of their business. Additional privacy notices will be provided by AIG Companies where relevant. Where applicable, we maintain privacy and security policies and procedures that protect social security numbers and other sensitive personal information by maintaining their confidentiality, prohibiting their unlawful disclosure, guarding against unauthorized access, establishing proper disposal procedures for them (such as shredding), and limiting their disclosure to third parties, except where required or permitted by law. 

     **WHAT TYPES OF NON-PERSONAL INFORMATION DO AIG AND AIG COMPANIES COLLECT ON THE WEBSITE?**

     “Cookies” and “Pixel Tags” 

     We constantly seek to maintain the integrity of, and make improvements to, the Website. As part of these efforts, we collect and analyze certain information about how visitors use the Website, as stated below. 

     When you visit our Website, we may collect various types of technical data including (but not limited to) domain name and/or Web browser information. This data may be gathered using cookies and other similar technologies. Cookies are small pieces of information that our server places on a visitor's computer hard drive to enable that person to more easily communicate and interact with the Website and to provide us with important information on how visitors use the Website. This Website uses cookies to allow you to select a preferred location view and default home page view and to let you access recently visited links (such as products, services, and individual AIG Company pages) more easily. Many Web browsers are automatically set to accept cookies. You may change your browser settings to either reject cookies or notify you when a cookie is about to be placed on your computer. Please note, however, that rejecting cookies while visiting the Website may result in certain parts of the Website not operating correctly or as efficiently as if they were allowed. For example, you will not be able to access a preferred location view, a customized default home page view or your recently visited links. 

     In addition, we may use a service that collects data remotely by using "pixel tags”, "web beacons", "clear GIFs", or similar means (collectively, "Pixel Tags") embedded in the Website's content. A Pixel Tag is an electronic image, often a single pixel (1x1) that is ordinarily not visible to Website visitors and may be associated with cookies on the visitors' hard drives. The data we collect includes which operating system and Web browser you use, how you navigate to and through our Website, and how long you stay on our web pages. This information does not include your name, e-mail address or any other personal information. 

     Please note that certain non-personal information may be linked with personal information. Any linked information will be treated as personal information for the purposes of this Policy as long as it is linked. 

     “IP Addresses” 

     As part of our efforts to maintain and improve the Website, we also collect IP addresses. An IP address is usually identified and logged automatically in our server log files whenever a visitor comes to the Website, along with the time of the visit and the page(s) that were visited. Collecting IP addresses is standard practice on the Internet and is done automatically by many other websites.  

     **WHAT DO AIG AND AIG COMPANIES DO WITH PERSONAL INFORMATION COLLECTED ON THE WEBSITE?**

     We will use personal information provided by visitors to fulfill the purpose for which such personal information was provided, as described in this Policy, or as disclosed at the time the visitor information is collected in additional privacy notices (for example in connection with the provision of insurance or the handling of claims by AIG Companies). 

     We may use personal information for our business purposes, such as data analysis, audits, developing new products, enhancing our websites, improving our services, identifying usage trends and determining the effectiveness of our promotional campaigns. We also may use personal information to provide you with customized content on our Website or to provide you with information most relevant to you. Additionally, we may use personal information to send you important information regarding the Website, changes to our terms and conditions, and policies and/or other administrative information, and to personalize your experience on the Website by presenting products and offers tailored to you. 

     We use the personal information you submit to respond to your inquiries. If your inquiry might appropriately be answered by a particular AIG Company, it may be forwarded to that company. That AIG Company will use the personal information to respond to your inquiry. Neither AIG nor any AIG Company will share information you submit with any third party for the third party's direct marketing purposes, unless you consent to this use. We also may use the personal information you submit to ask you follow-up questions about which products you have purchased or are considering purchasing, in order to improve our services and better understand your needs. 

     We may also offer visitors the opportunity to receive special promotions. If a visitor elects to receive such offers by becoming a Member of the Website, we will use the personal information provided by that visitor to send those offers. 

     We may also use personal information as we believe to be necessary or appropriate: (a) under applicable law, including laws outside your country of residence; (b) to comply with legal process; (c) to respond to requests from public and government authorities, including public and government authorities outside your country of residence; (d) to enforce our terms and conditions; (e) to protect our operations or those of any of our affiliates; (f) to protect our rights, privacy, safety or property, and/or that of our affiliates, you or others; and (g) to allow us to pursue available remedies or limit the damages that we may sustain.  

     **CAN I "OPT OUT" OF RECEIVING E-MAIL PROMOTIONS FROM AIG AND AIG COMPANIES?**

     If you change your mind about receiving promotional e-mails or electronic newsletters from AIG or an AIG Company, you may choose not to receive such communications from the company that sent you the e-mail by: (1) following the "unsubscribe" instructions in the specific e-mail from which you wish to opt-out or (2) sending an e-mail to [reply@aig.com](mailto:reply@aig.com), specifying the particular e-mails list(s) from which you wish to be removed. We will respond to a request made pursuant to these methods as promptly as practicable. Even if you elect to stop receiving promotional e-mails from us, AIG and AIG Companies may still contact you to tell you important administrative information about the Website or us.  

     **DO AIG AND AIG COMPANIES SHARE PERSONAL INFORMATION WITH OTHER COMPANIES?  **

     We may share personal information with our affiliates for the purposes described in this Policy. AIG is the party responsible for the management of jointly used personal information. 

      We will not intentionally share your personal information with unaffiliated entities except: (1) as described in this Policy or as disclosed at the time your personal information is provided; or (2) with your consent. 

     AIG and AIG Companies work with third parties which provide services to us and we may share your personal information with those third parties, including without limitation: third parties providing website hosting or e-mail hosting or information technology consulting services, marketing and promotion services, newsletters, data analysis, legal services, accounting services, and other administrative and back-up and security services. 

     We may also disclose personal information in order to: (1) comply with applicable laws; (2) respond to inquiries or requests from government or public authorities, including government or public authorities outside your country of residence; (3) comply with legal process; (4) protect the operations of AIG and AIG Companies; (5) protect the rights, privacy, safety or property of AIG, AIG Companies, Website visitors or the public; (6) permit us to pursue available remedies or limit the damages that we may sustain; and (7) enforce our Terms of Use. 

     In the event there is a change in the corporate structure of AIG or AIG Companies such as, but not limited to, a merger, consolidation, sale, liquidation or transfer of substantial assets, AIG and AIG Companies may, in their sole discretion, transfer, sell or assign information collected on and through this Website, including, without limitation, personal information concerning visitors, to one or more affiliated or unaffiliated third parties.  

     **WHAT DO AIG AND AIG COMPANIES DO WITH NON-PERSONAL INFORMATION COLLECTED ON THE WEBSITE?**

     Because non-personal information collected on the Website does not personally identify you, we may use non-personal information for any purpose, and share non-personal information with third parties for any purpose. 

     “Cookies” and “Pixel Tags” 

     For example, we share the information gathered using cookies, Pixel Tags and other similar technologies with other AIG companies and with our third party vendors. Our vendors may give us reports of this non-personal information. We use this information to improve our Website by responding to our users' interests and providing more relevant and useful information. For example, we use non-personal information collected on the Website to evaluate how the Website is being used. In addition, we may collect and analyze information about how many visitors arrived at certain pages of the Website, how long they stayed on those pages, and where they went afterwards. This information allows us to determine which pages might be the most popular and interesting to visitors and enables us to provide visitors with a better and richer experience on the Website. For example, we may use certain non-personal information to improve the performance of our Website 

     In addition, we may share statistical information derived from the information submitted with third parties; however, such statistical information is not associated with any individual in a personally identifiable manner. 

      “IP Addresses” 

     We use IP addresses for purposes such as calculating Website usage levels, helping diagnose server problems, and administering the Website. We may also use and disclose IP addresses for all the purposes for which we use and disclose personal information. Please note that we treat IP addresses, server log files and related information as non-personal information, except where we are required to do otherwise under applicable law. 

     **IF I LINK TO ANOTHER WEBSITE AND PROVIDE INFORMATION TO THAT WEBSITE, HOW WILL THAT INFORMATION BE HANDLED?**

     This Website may contain links to other websites. The operator of such other websites (whether AIG, an AIG Company or an unaffiliated third party) may collect information about you, including through cookies or other technologies. If you link to another website, you will leave this Website and this Policy will not apply to your use of and activity on those other websites. If you provide personal information through any such website, your transaction will occur on that website (not this Website) and the personal information you provide will be collected by, and controlled by the privacy policy of that website's operator. Links on this Website to other websites are provided only as a convenience, and the inclusion of such links does not imply endorsement of the linked website. We encourage you to read the legal notices posted on those websites, including their privacy policies. We shall have no responsibility or liability for your visitation to, and the data collection and use practices of, such other websites. This Policy applies solely to online information collection and use practices in connection with this Website; it does not apply to any practices conducted offline or in connection with other websites owned or operated by AIG, any AIG Company or any unaffiliated third parties.  

     **WHAT INFORMATION CAN THIRD PARTIES COLLECT THROUGH THE WEBSITE?**

     Please note that our online and e-mail advertising-related vendors may use “Pixel Tags” (meaning provided above under the heading “What types of Non-Personal Information do AIG and AIG Companies collect on the Website?”), or other similar technologies, in connection with the Website to help manage our online and e-mail advertising campaigns and strengthen the effectiveness of such campaigns. For example, if a vendor has placed a unique cookie on your computer, the vendor may use Pixel Tags or other similar technologies to recognize the cookie during your visit to the Website and to learn which of our online advertisements may have brought you to the Website, and the vendor may provide us with such non-personal information for our use. Please note we may link such non-personal information provided to us by our vendors to personal information about you that we have previously collected. Such combined information will be treated as personal information hereunder as long as it is so combined. 

     One of the advertisement companies that we use is Google, Inc, trading as ‘DoubleClick’. To opt out from the DoubleClick advertisement cookie please visit: [www.doubleclick.com/privacy/index.aspx](http://www.doubleclick.com/privacy/index.aspx)
