# Privacy Policy - AirHelp

AirHelp views data privacy as a fundamental component of doing business. Our data protection policy and practices are focused on processing, sharing and storing personal information appropriately and lawfully, while providing confidentiality, integrity and availability.

This privacy statement applies to AirHelp’s primary operational entity, AirHelp Limited, incorporated in Hong Kong, and its subsidiaries (including partly owned subsidiaries where AirHelp Limited directly or indirectly controls more than 50% of the voting interest). It also applies to AirHelp Limited’s parent, AirHelp, Inc. For the purpose of this policy, the term “AirHelp” refers to the whole company group or each of the companies as the case may be.

AirHelp processes and stores personal data within the EU and will at any given time be able to demonstrate compliance with the EU legislation as well as our principles set out herein.

This privacy statement represents the full online privacy policy applicable to airhelp.com’s online activities. The statement explains the type of information we collect from the customers online and how we use that information.

Our website is governed in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”), (Regulation (EU) 2016/679), which is a directly binding legislative act. The GDPR creates some new rights for individuals and strengthens some of the rights that currently exist under Directive 95/46/EC. Directive 95/46/EC will be repealed with effect from May 25, 2018. This policy is made compliant with the GDPR and is therefore also compliant with Directive 95/46/EC and national implementations thereof until they become obsolete on May 25, 2018.

The privacy statement is under the responsibility of the Legal team at AirHelp, who has the overall responsibility to ensure compliance. The data protection officer (DPO) is responsible for the implementation of our data protection policy, which is intrinsically linked to the privacy statement. The DPO is ensuring compliance on a daily basis and is involved in all issues related to the protection of personal data.

AirHelp is to be considered the data controller and will determine the purposes and means of the processing of personal data submitted and collected online.

## Personal data

Personal data means any information that may be related to an identified or identifiable natural person (the “data subject”). Personal data includes all types of information that is direct or indirect (that is, used in conjunction with other data) referable to the data subject, such as names, date of birth, addresses, e-mail addresses, telephone numbers etc.

## Collection of personal data

The users of the website who likes to benefit from our services and submit information to us may be asked to provide personal data in order for AirHelp to operate and improve our business and services. We primarily collect personal data such as names, date of birth, addresses, e-mail addresses, telephone numbers, passport/ID, national identification numbers; (i) to help customers pursue their rights according to EC 261 or any other applicable air passenger rights regulation, when their flights have been delayed, cancelled or overbooked; (ii) inform travelers, free of charge, by e-mail about air passenger rights, flight data, airport data and other air traffic related services of relevance. This is the core activity of AirHelp as a business. This means that the initial process consist of collecting personal data to determine whether the claim is eligible. If the claim is assessed as viable AirHelp contacts the air carrier on behalf of the customer, and if it is deemed necessary help the customer to pursue legal action, all in the interest of the customer. We may also collect applicant’s physical address when applying for a position. Furthermore we collect personal data for other purposes such as statistics, administration and communication, IT and security administration, physical security, authentication and authorization systems, support systems, collaboration of internal projects and organizational teams and activities. We will process personal data only to the extent required for a specified, explicit and legitimate purpose or for a purpose required by law in places where we operate.

AirHelp purchases flight data from third parties, e.g. information on delayed or cancelled flights within a given time etc. This information is non-private data, which we combine with the private data submitted by our customers. This is only used to notify customers about eligible claims and claim filing purposes in order to collect potential compensation on behalf of our customers.
