# Privacy Policy | American Institutes for Research

Thank you for visiting the American Institutes for Research (AIR) website and reviewing our Privacy Policy. You may visit our site without revealing any information about yourself.  However, if you are requesting information from AIR, we may have to collect personal information from you. AIR values our visitors' private information and understands the need for security and trust surrounding such information. Any personal information AIR collects is for internal purposes only; we will not sell, trade, rent, share, or disclose any of your personal information to a third party without your consent.

This Policy describes the types of information we may collect from you or that you may provide when you visit the website [www.air.org](https://web.archive.org/) and our practices for collecting, using, maintaining, protecting and disclosing that information.

**Information Collection and Use**

_Personal Information_

AIR does not collect personal information about visitors to our website unless you choose to provide that information to us. We will use such information only for the purpose(s) stated at the time it is collected, and never for secondary or unrelated purposes unless otherwise requested or explicitly agreed to by the website user. In cases when such information is requested to provide a service or respond to an inquiry, visitors need to provide only the minimal information necessary. Typically, AIR will collect personal information for the following reasons:

  * To allow us to respond to inquiries and requests;
  * To allow us to process an event registration form;
  * To allow access to an informational electronic mailing list, newsletter, or database; or
  * To contact you about the services on our site about which you have expressed interest, such as newsletters or products.



_Applying to work at AIR_

When you apply online to work for AIR, we will ask you for your name, contact information, and date of birth. We may ask you for other data that would be typical for employment, including a resume.

_Surveys_

Occasionally, AIR may provide the opportunity to participate in surveys on our site.  Participation in these surveys is completely voluntary. We use survey results to continue to improve this site and its content. If we use a third-party service to conduct the surveys, the service will be prohibited from using our users’ personally identifiable information for any other purpose. AIR will never share personally identifiable information you provide through a survey with third parties.

Our website servers log the standard information about website users including the device identifier or IP address of the user, domain of the user, URLs visited, the date/time you accessed our site, and other general demographic information. We use this information, which in itself is anonymous and does not identify individual users, solely to try to better understand visitor preferences and administer our site. We collect and use this information in aggregate form so that it cannot be manipulated to identify any particular individual user. AIR uses persistent cookies for one purpose only–to enable our analytics program to differentiate between new and returning visitors to our site.  Persistent cookies can be removed by following your web browser’s directions.

_Opting Out_
