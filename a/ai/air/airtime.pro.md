## The Sourcefabric Privacy and Data Policy covers the following:

●      How Sourcefabric handles your data

●      What we do with information you give us

●      What information we collect when you use our services and download our software 

●      How we use cookies

●      How to get in touch regarding privacy issues

Sourcefabric believes in sharing as much information as possible about its products, its operations and its associations. Accordingly, community members should understand — as should anybody who interacts with Sourcefabric — that any information provided to Sourcefabric might be made available to the public. There are four broad exceptions to that rule:

  1. Sourcefabric does not publicly release information gathered in connection with commercial transactions (i.e. transactions involving money), including transactions conducted through the Sourcefabric SaaS infrastructure or donations to Sourcefabric z.ú.
  2. Sourcefabric does not publicly release personally identifying information collected in connection with an application for employment with Sourcefabric.
  3. Sourcefabric does not make publicly available information that is used to authenticate users, the publication of which would compromise the security of the websites of Sourcefabric or any of our clients (e.g. passwords).
  4. Sourcefabric does not make publicly available information that it specifically promises at the time of collection to maintain in confidence.



If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. 

We collect four types of information and data:

  1. “Personal Information” is information that you provide to us that personally identifies you, such as your name, phone number, or email address. 
  2. “Non-Personal Information” is information that cannot be directly associated with a specific person or entity. Non-Personal Information includes but is not limited to your computer’s configuration and the browser version you use.
  3. “Potentially Personal Information” is information that is Non-Personal Information in and of itself but that could be used in conjunction with other information to personally identify you. For example, Uniform Resource Locators (URLs, the addresses of web pages) or Internet Protocol (IP) addresses (the addresses of computers on the Internet), which are Non-Personal Information in and of themselves, could be Personal Information when combined with Internet service provider (ISP) records.
  4. “Aggregate Data” is information about users that is recorded and collected into groups so that it no longer reflects or references an individually identifiable user. This includes the kind of data provided by Google Analytics, such as where you are and what site led you to [sourcefabric.org](http://sourcefabric.org/).



We collect this information for two reasons: one, to better understand how people use our websites, tools and products; and two, to help people better understand how to use those websites, tools and products. 

The amount and type of data depends on nature of the interaction. Sourcefabric collects only as much information as necessary or appropriate to fulfill these two purposes.

Here are some examples of data we collect:

### Data we collect from community members (contributors, customers etc.)

  * If you want to post content to our forums, we ask for your username (to identify content as having been posted by you). 
  * If you subscribe to our newsletter, we will need your first name, last name and email address. You can also set your preferences.
  * If you participate in a live chat session, we may ask for your username and other account details so our Support Team can identify you and make sure you have rightful access to the account.
  * We will ask for your name and address if you want Sourcefabric to provide you with promotional material, surveys to be completed, event information or information about Sourcefabric.
  * For job applications, we will need more relevant, in-depth information about you to make a proper assessment. 
  * If you purchase one of our products, we will need personal and financial information to process any transactions.



### Data we collect from website visitors

  * Collection of personally identifying (names, email addresses, phone numbers), non-personally identifying (web browser type, operating system, language preference, referring sites, date and time of each visitor request) and Potentially Personal Information, such as IP adresses.
  * Sourcefabric collects Potentially Personal Information, such as IP addresses, for logged-in users and for users leaving comments on hosted online publications. Sourcefabric only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses Personal Information as described under Legal Process and Other Disclosures below, except that blog commenter IP addresses are visible and disclosed to the administrators of the online publication where the comment was left.



**We will never rent or sell your data to anyone.**

Sourcefabric may share information, only when necessary, with specific employees, contractors, service providers and only when all agree to Sourcefabric Privacy Policies

Sourcefabric discloses your data only to those of its employees and contractors that

  * Need to know that information in order to process it on Sourcefabric’s behalf or to provide services available at Sourcefabric’s websites, and 


  * That have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country.



From time to time, Sourcefabric may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g. by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.

Additionally, Sourcefabric may need to transfer Personal Information to an affiliate or successor in the event of a change of our organisational structure or status, such as in the event of a restructuring, sale, or bankruptcy. We will retain any Personal Information for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Policy. 

### International data transfers

Sourcefabric’s headquarters are based in Europe, and your Personal Information is collected, stored, used and shared in accordance with European laws. However, Sourcefabric is a global organization and operates in different countries. From time to time, it may be necessary for us to transfer your personal data to the United States or other countries. 

You should be aware that privacy laws vary from country to country. By using our websites and our tools, you consent to the transfer of the information collected, as outlined by this Policy, to Sourcefabric or its third-party service providers to places where our distributed, third-party content delivery network exists (which is in several countries around the world), which countries may provide a lesser level of data security than in your country of residence.

## Protection of certain Personal Information

Sourcefabric takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of Potentially Personal and Personal Information.

Sourcefabric undertakes a range of security measures, including monitoring technical security of our systems and environment to help to protect your Personal Information from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. Also, we keep any data in isolated virtual environments to avoid interaction with other software programmes. 

In case of disclosure of your Personal Information to any third party mentioned above, Sourcefabric binds itself to abide by all relevant laws. We will ensure that any contracts we have with third parties are valid and have provisions which ensure that the third party will not use your information for any other purpose than stated by Sourcefabric. We will take all reasonable measures to ensure that any contracted third party has adopted proper measures to protect your Personal Information against unlawful use and against coincidental loss and destruction.

## Updating of Personal Information

You may request access, correction, or deletion of your Personal Information or Potentially Personal Information, as permitted by law. Sourcefabric will seek to comply with such requests, provided we have sufficient information to identify the Personal Information or Potentially Personal Information related to you. To do so, please contact Sourcefabric by sending an email to [security@sourcefabric.org](mailto:security@sourcefabric.org).

## Cookies and how we use them

A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Most major websites use cookies. Because the browser provides this cookie information to the website at each visit, cookies serve as a sort of label that allows a website to recognize a browser when it returns to the site. 

Sourcefabric’s websites use cookies to help us identify and track visitors, their use of our websites, and their website access preferences across multiple requests and visits. The term usually used to describe this is “web analytics”. Cookies are the tools by which a website owner collects web analytics data.

Sourcefabric uses Google Analytics. We will use web analytics data only to determine aggregate usage patterns for our websites as described above. 

While it is possible to link cookies to Personal Information, thereby permitting website operators, including our third-party analytics providers, to track the online movements of particular individuals. Sourcefabric does not do so, however, and its third-party service providers are not allowed to correlate Sourcefabric data with any other data.

Sourcefabric uses the information provided by cookies and clear gifs to develop a better understanding of how our visitors use our websites, and to facilitate those visitors’ interactions with our websites. Sourcefabric may make the aggregate data obtained from web analytics (including from our third-party analytics providers, if applicable) publicly available. If this data is made available, none of the information will be Personal Information or Potentially Personal Information.

### Third-party cookies

Content from other sources that is hosted on Sourcefabric websites, such as such as embedded YouTube videos and other site-linking buttons, may sometimes contain cookies that send information to those third parties. 

In such cases, the privacy policy of the third party governs with respect to information that may be collected by and sent to the respective third party. 

You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Sourcefabric visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers by Sourcefabric, its contractors, or third-party service providers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before accessing Sourcefabric’s websites. Certain features of Sourcefabric’s websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.

If you have supplied your email address and signed up to one of our newsletters, Sourcefabric may occasionally send you an email (using the programme Mailchimp) to issue important information, such as changes to this Agreement or vital security information.

## Newsletters

Currently there are two types of newsletters:

  * Generic Sourcefabric news (sign up on our front page on [www.sourcefabric.org](http://www.sourcefabric.org/))
  * Specific Products  / Pro Customer



If you signed up to receive receive newsletters from Sourcefabric but no longer wish to receive them, you can opt-out by following the “unsubscribe” instructions in any such communication you receive.

## Sourcefabric ads on third-party websites

In the event that Sourcefabric places advertisements on third-party websites, it is done so to introduce people to our products and services, to encourage people to contribute to our community-based activities, and to provide opportunities to sign up to receive communications from Sourcefabric. We stand by our online advertising practices and aim to provide full transparency and control over how our ads appear and function.

Some advertisements may use cookies and/or clear GIFs. When you view Sourcefabric advertisements on third-party sites, cookies and/or clear GIFs from these campaigns help Sourcefabric measure and improve performance of our advertising. We do not use cookies to save data that identifies you personally, nor do we capture behavioral data to personalize future ads or create targeting profiles about you. 

## Ads on Sourcefabric websites 

Ads appearing on any of our websites may be delivered to users by advertising partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to compile information about you or others who use your computer. This information allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This Policy covers only the use of cookies by Sourcefabric; it does not cover the use of cookies by advertisers.

Sourcefabric may interact with you through social media. When you interact with us at a third-party social network, such as Facebook, Twitter or Google +, the network gives us the ability to access and store certain information from your profile for that social network.

The categories of information we can access will depend, in part, on the permissions you grant us and the privacy settings you have established on that social network. In general, we try to minimize the amount of data we receive about you on such social networks. We will handle any information we receive from these services in accordance with this Policy.

Sourcefabric discloses data only in response to a subpoena or court order, or when Sourcefabric believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Sourcefabric, third parties or the public at large.

Consistent with our privacy commitments, we will scrutinize third-party requests for information about you for compliance with the law, including those coming from governmental agencies or civil litigants. We may access, use, preserve or disclose information about you only when we have a good-faith belief that it is reasonably necessary to do so to satisfy the applicable law, regulation, legal process or lawful governmental request of any country, or to protect the rights, property or safety of Sourcefabric, its users or the public. We will provide notice of legal process or governmental requests unless prohibited to do so by law or the circumstances warrant otherwise.
