##  Our price guarantee policy

We won't be beaten on price. So in the unlikely event you find a better price for the same vehicle from the same brand on another website, tell us and we'll beat the price by $1, plus give you a 25% discount off DriveEasy excess cover.

###  How to tell us if someone is cheaper

Please email us via the "contact us" link above and email your exact travel dates and locations, vehicle specs (note - these must be the same vehicle as shown on our website). Please include the quoted price and the name of the website you found or were offered a better price (or provide a written quote).

###  Terms of our Lowest Price Guarantee:

Our guarantee applies to renting the exact same vehicle for the same duration, at the same time of year, from the same brand (eg Avis, Thrifty, Alamo, Hertz).

  * Offer applies to advertised deals or written quotes and for this offer to be valid we may require evidence.
  * Offer is subject to availability. Our price guarantee is a serious promise for matching any competitor's legitimate price offer, but for our own protection, we reserve the right to refuse to match a price at any time, mainly due to the fact that some websites may have an incorrect/out of date rates showing, or a quote may have been modified by the customer.
