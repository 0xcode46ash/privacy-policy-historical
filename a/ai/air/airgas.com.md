| Privacy Policy

Airgas knows that you care how information about you is used and shared, and we appreciate your trust that we will do so carefully and sensibly. This notice describes our privacy policy. By visiting Airgas on-line ("Airgas On-line"), you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Notice.

1\. What Information is Gathered?

The information we learn from customers helps us personalize and continually improve your buying experience at Airgas On-line. Here are the types of information we gather: 

  * Information You Give Us: We receive and store any information you enter on our Web site or give us in any other way. You can choose not to provide certain information, but then you might not be able to take advantage of many of our features. We use the information that you provide for such purposes as responding to your requests, customizing future buying for you, improving our site and product offerings, and communicating with you.
  * Automatic Information: We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with us. For example, like many Web sites, we use "cookies," and we obtain certain types of information when your Web browser accesses Airgas On-line. A number of companies offer utilities designed to help you visit Web sites anonymously. Although we will not be able to provide you with a personalized experience at Airgas On-Line if we cannot recognize you, we want you to be aware that these tools exist.
  * Information from Other Sources: For reasons such as improving personalization of our service (for example, providing better product recommendations or special offers that we think will interest you), we might receive information about you from other sources and add it to our account information. We also sometimes receive updated delivery and address information from our shippers or other sources so that we can correct our records and deliver your next purchase or communication more easily.

2\. Does Airgas On-line Share Information about You?

Information about our customers is an important part of our business, and we are not in the business of selling it to others. We share customer information only with the Airgas subsidiaries and Airgas On-line exercises controls on this information as described below: 

  * Affiliated Businesses We Do Not Control: We work closely with our affiliated businesses. In some cases, these businesses operate stores that interact with Airgas On-line or sell offerings to you at Airgas On-line. In other cases, we provide services or sell product lines jointly with these businesses. You can tell when another business is involved in your transactions, and we share customer information related to those transactions with that business.
  * Agents: We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include fulfilling orders, delivering packages, sending postal mail and e-mail, removing repetitive information from customer lists, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, processing credit card payments, and providing customer service. They have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes.
  * Business Transfers: As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy assets. In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred business assets. Also, in the unlikely event that Airgas On-line or substantially all of its assets are acquired, customer information will of course be one of the transferred assets.
  * Protection of Airgas On-line and Others: We release account and other personal information when we believe it is appropriate to comply with law; enforce or apply our Terms and Conditions of Use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Airgas On-line, our users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.
  * With Your Consent: Other than as set out above, you will receive notice when information about you might go to third parties, and you will have an opportunity to choose not to share the information.

3\. How Secure Is Information About Me?

  * We work to protect the security of your information during transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts information you input.
  * We reveal only the last five digits of your credit card numbers when confirming an order. Of course, we transmit the entire credit card number to the appropriate credit card company during order processing.
  * It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer. Be sure to sign off when finished using a shared computer.

4.Conditions of Use, Notices, and Revisions

  * If you choose to visit Airgas On-line, your visit and any dispute over privacy is subject to this Notice and our Terms and Conditions of Use, including limitations on damages, arbitration of disputes, and application of the law of the state of Pennsylvania.
  * This Notice and the Terms and Conditions of Use will change also, and use of information that we gather now is subject to the Privacy Notice in effect at the time of use unless you are otherwise notified. We may e-mail periodic reminders of our notices and conditions, unless you have instructed us not to, but you should check our Web site frequently to see recent changes.

5\. Cookies
