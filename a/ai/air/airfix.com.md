**Disclosing Information**  
We will not sell or share your personal information with third parties unless it is necessary to fulfil your order or you have consented to us doing so.

We will not transfer your personal information to companies outside of the European Union or the European Economic Area without your prior written consent.

We reserve the right to make a small charge to cover our administration costs for producing the information. The information will be sent to you within the time scales set out in the Data Protection Act 1998.

**Links to Third Party Websites**  
When you are using the Website you can move to other websites which are not operated by Us ("Third Party Websites"). Third Party Websites may send their own cookies to you and collect or request data and personal information. We do not control Third Party Websites and therefore are not responsible for them.

**Use of Discussion Forum and Bulletin Boards**  
Please remember that when you give out information on-line (e.g. by message or bulletin boards or discussion forum) that information may become public information and can be collected and used by people that you don't know. You should exercise caution when deciding to disclose information on bulletin boards and discussion forum.

**Person to Person contact**  
Whilst Humbrol understands that forum users may wish to contact each other through person-to-person means outside of the Airfix website and that the significant majority of internet users are genuinely who they represent themselves to be, a small minority who use the internet are not. As such, Humbrol has made it company policy not to actively facilitate person-to-person contact outside of its website. There is thus no provision for any fields in a user profile or otherwise for people to advertise email addresses, chat room aliases or other identifiers. If you choose to disclose such information on the forums Humbrol accepts no liability for any consequences.

**Children**  
The Website is not intended for use by children, especially those under 14. No one under the age of 14 is allowed to provide any personal information or to use our forums without parental consent. If your children disclose information about themselves in our forums or bulletin boards they may get unsolicited messages from other people. Accordingly it is up to parents to ensure that their children abide by our Terms and Conditions. If you are concerned about your childrenâ€™s activities or their privacy on the Website then please email us at [ consumerservices@humbrol.com](mailto:consumerservices@humbrol.com?subject=Consumer%20Services%20enquiry)

From time to time we may decide or be legally obliged to update this privacy policy. We will post any changes on the Website. Except as required by law, any modifications of this privacy policy will not affect our treatment of data collected prior to the effective date of the policy change.
