We use this information to measure the use of the site and improve the content delivered on the site.

When you make a request for further information from The Art Institutes, you are asked to provide certain contact information that is collected and used for the purpose of responding to your request. The information collected from you may include your name, address, telephone number or email address. We may use this information to contact you through various means, including phone calls, text messages, e-mail and postal mail about programs and services that we offer.

We collect personal information you submit pursuant to the registration and inquiry submission processes of our Web site. If you e-mail us, you are voluntarily releasing information to us.

In addition, we may have collected similar information from you in the past. We use that historic information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. By using our Web site you are consenting to our continued use of any such information.

When you make a request for further information and provide The Art Institutes with your personal contact information, that information is collected and used for the purpose of responding to your specific requests.

Even with such technology, no Web site is 100% secure. We will take reasonable measures that we believe are appropriate to protect your information from loss, misuse, alteration or destruction, and, where possible, will ask that any third parties to whom we may transfer your information take comparable steps to protect that security.

If you use this site, you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your access information and password and for restricting access to your computer. You also agree to accept responsibility for all activities that occur under your password.
