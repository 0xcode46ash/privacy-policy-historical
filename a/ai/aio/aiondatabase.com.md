As part of its general functionality, our server cannot recognize any information regarding the domain, email, or regular mail address of a specific user unless provided to us. 

We collect page 'hit' information that tells us what pages consumers access or visit. This information is completely anonymous and is used solely for internal review and to improve the content of our website. 

We collect information such as name, email address, and regular mail address only when it is volunteered by the consumer for use in surveys, sweepstakes and contests. We build listservs (mailing lists) using this information on a completely voluntary, non-obligatory and free basis that enable us to notify consumers of news on our site. 

Unless we specifically indicate otherwise, these listservs and any other personally identifiable information voluntarily given will be used solely by playata GmbH. and its employees for internal purposes and will not be published, sold or otherwise transferred to third parties.
