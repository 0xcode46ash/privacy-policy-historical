**What information do we collect and how do we use it?**

  * For each visitor to our Web page, our Web server automatically recognizes the consumer's domain name, but not the e-mail address. We collect only the domain name of visitors to our Web page and aggregate information on what pages consumers visit and information volunteered by the consumer - such as survey information and site registrations. The information we collect is used for internal review and is then discarded. It is used to improve the content of our Web page and is not shared with other organizations for commercial purposes.  

  * If you supply us with your postal address on-line, it will be used to supply you with the requested information or materials for which it was provided. In addition, AICR may, from time to time, mail you additional information we think may be of interest to you, or may request financial support for the Institute's cancer research and education programs. Should you wish not to be contacted, please let us know by writing to the above address, or by contacting us via email at [aicrweb@aicr.org.](mailto:aicrweb@aicr.org.)  

  * If you supply us with your telephone number on-line, you may receive telephone contact from us with information or questions regarding orders you have placed on-line. In addition, AICR may, from time to time, make telephone contact about other issues we think may be of interest to you, or to request financial support for AICR's programs in cancer research and education. Should you wish not to be contacted about such matters, please let us know by writing to the above address, or by contacting us via email at [aicrweb@aicr.org. ](mailto:aicrweb@aicr.org.)

Also, aicr.org may provide aggregate statistics about our visitors, orders received, traffic patterns and related site information to reputable third-party vendors, but these statistics will not include any e-mail addresses. 

**In summary**

We are committed to protecting your privacy. We use the information we collect on this site to make improvements to our Web site and to enhance your Web experience.
