# American Institute for Cancer Research (AICR): Privacy Policy

**Your Privacy Rights**

At AICR, we are committed to protecting your privacy. We use the information you provide to process orders, information requests, and to help you enjoy a more personalized Web experience. Please read on for more detail about our privacy policy. 

•For each visitor to our Web page, our Web server automatically recognizes the consumer's domain name, but not the email address. We collect only the domain name of visitors to our Web page and aggregate information on what pages consumers visit and information volunteered by the consumer - such as survey information and site registrations. The information we collect is used for internal review and is then discarded. It is used to improve the content of our Web page and is not shared with other organizations for commercial purposes.

•If you supply us with your postal address on-line, it will be used to supply you with the requested information or materials for which it was provided. In addition, AICR may, from time to time, mail you additional information we think may be of interest to you, or may request financial support for the Institute's cancer research and education programs. Should you wish not to be contacted, please let us know by writing to the above address, or by contacting us via email at [aicrweb@aicr.org](mailto:aicrweb@aicr.org).

•If you supply us with your telephone number on-line, you may receive telephone contact from us with information or questions regarding orders you have placed on-line. In addition, AICR may, from time to time, make telephone contact about other issues we think may be of interest to you, or to request financial support for AICR's programs in cancer research and education. Should you wish not to be contacted about such matters, please let us know by writing to the above address, or by contacting us via email at [aicrweb@aicr.org](mailto:aicrweb@aicr.org).

•If you supply us with your email address on-line, you may receive email communication from us with information or questions regarding orders you have placed on-line. In addition, AICR may, from time to time, make email contact about other issues we think may be of interest to you, or to request financial support for AICR's programs in cancer research and education. Should you wish not to be contacted about such matters, please let us know by writing to the above address, or by contacting us via email at [aicrweb@aicr.org](mailto:aicrweb@aicr.org).

**What about "cookies"?**

"Cookies" are small pieces of information that are stored by your browser on your computer's hard drive. Our cookies do not contain any personally identifying information, but they do enable us to provide additional features on this site. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually change your browser to prevent that, if required. Even without a cookie, you can still use most of the features in our Web site.

**Will AICR disclose the information it collects to outside parties?**

aicr.org does not currently sell, trade or rent email addresses to others. We may choose to do so in the future with trustworthy third parties, but you can tell us if you would prefer us not to by sending an email message to [aicrweb@aicr.org](mailto:aicrweb@aicr.org). (If you use more than one email address to visit this Web site, send this message from each email account you use.) Also, aicr.org may provide aggregate statistics about our visitors, orders received, traffic patterns and related site information to reputable third-party vendors, but these statistics will not include any email addresses.

**Tell-A-Friend:**

If a user elects to use our referral service for informing a friend about our Site or e-newsletters, we ask them for the friend's name and email address. The American Institute for Cancer Research will automatically send the friend a one-time email inviting them to visit the Site. The American Institute for Cancer Research stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email. 

**Other Web Sites:**

Our Site contains links to other Web sites. Please note that when you click on one of these links, you are entering another Web site for which the American Institute for Cancer Research has no responsibility. We encourage you to read the privacy statement on all such sites as their policies may be different than ours. 

**Online Security:**

All information provided to the American Institute for Cancer Research is transmitted using SSL (Secure SocketLayer) encryption. SSL is a proven coding system that lets your browser automatically encrypt, or scramble, data before you send it to us. We also protect account information by placing it on a secure portion of our Site that is only accessible by certain qualified employees of the American Institute for Cancer Research. Unfortunately, however, no data transmission over the Internet is 100% secure. While we strive to protect your information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of such information. Unless there are issues with a particular transaction, AICR does not access the credit card information. If you have any questions about a particular transaction, please feel free to contact us via email at [support@aicr.org](mailto:support@aicr.org) or by telephone at 1-800-843-8114.

**In summary:**

We are committed to protecting your privacy. We use the information we collect on this site to make improvements to our Web site and to enhance your Web experience. We do not sell, trade or rent email addresses to others. We may choose to do so in the future with trustworthy third parties, but you can tell us not to by sending an email message to [aicrweb@aicr.org](mailto:aicrweb@aicr.org)

**Your consent**
