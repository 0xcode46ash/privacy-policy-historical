####   
Third-party use of information you voluntarily provide at the AIChE Website

From time to time, AIChE rents portions of its mailing list to reputable third parties. We generally supply mailing labels, or in some cases a magnetic tape, to a bonded mailing house who destroys the tape after use. This reduces the likelihood that the mailing list will be entered into the third party's promotional database.

AIChE may be required to provide information about any of its customers or prospective customers to law enforcement or government agencies if requested and/or as we feel necessary.

AIChE reserves the right to change this policy in any manner at any time without prior notice.
