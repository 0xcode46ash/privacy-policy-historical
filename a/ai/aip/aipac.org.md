AIPAC firmly believes in protecting the privacy of our members as well as visitors to our website.

Financial information (such as credit card numbers, expiration dates, etc.) and personal information (such as name, email address, zip code, etc.) that you provide on our website or via mail is handled with utmost security and privacy. This information is used solely for our own business purposes, such as to process a donation or to contact you at a later date, and is not shared or sold to outside organizations or companies. We will share your personal information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this privacy policy. 

Names and mail addresses are occasionally shared as part of list exchanges with like-minded organizations. AIPAC has and will continue to honor all requests from individuals that their names and addresses not be exchanged or shared to any other entity. To request that your email address not be shared as part of these list exchanges, please email [membership@aipac.org](mailto:membership@aipac.org).

We may provide your personal information to companies that provide services to help us with our business activities such as offering customer service. These companies are authorized to use your personal information only as necessary to provide these services to us. 

We may also disclose your personal information:

  * as required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena, or similar legal process
  * when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request,
  * if AIPAC is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets,  you will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our Web site of any change in ownership or uses of your personal information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personal information, 
  * to any other third party with your prior consent to do so.



**Security**

AIPAC takes the utmost care to protect the safety and security of your online transactions by using industry-standard encryption and security protocols. When you enter sensitive information (such as a credit card number) on our order forms, we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). The credit card information provided is only entered through the site but is stored on our third party payment gateway.

We follow generally accepted standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.  No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however.  Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. If you have any questions about security on our Web site, you can contact us at [membership@aipac.org](mailto:membership@aipac.org).

**User Access and Choice**

If your personal information changes, or if you no longer desire our service, you may correct, update, amend or delete it by making the change on our member information page or by emailing us at [membership@aipac.org](mailto:membership@aipac.org) or by contacting us by telephone or postal mail at the contact information listed below.  We will respond to your request to access within 30 days. 

We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services. We will retain and use your information for seven years to comply with our accounting and legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.

If you wish to subscribe to our newsletter(s), we will use your name and email address to send the newsletter to you.  Out of respect for your privacy, you may choose to stop receiving our newsletter or marketing emails by following the unsubscribe instructions included in these emails, or you can contact us at [membership@aipac.org](mailto:membership@aipac.org).

**How We Use Cookies and Web Beacons**

In order to provide you with the most user friendly experience online, AIPAC may utilize cookies to customize your experience based on prior interactions with our website. Cookies are pieces of information stored on your computer that can help websites like ours tailor information most applicable to your visit. Cookies also help AIPAC analyze overall usage on our site so we can see which sections are most/least useful to our members. We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies.  Standing alone, cookies do not personally identify you; they merely recognize your Web browser. A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser. Session cookies are used to understand how you navigate our Web site and how long you remain on the Web site during a single visit. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time to help us understand how often you visit our Web site and how your navigation of it changes from visit to visit.

Please know that cookies are not required for using AIPAC’s website and you may remove or disable cookies at any time using instructions found in the help menu of your web browser. Please also know that AIPAC may occasionally share information gathered in cookies with third party vendors, such as Google, in order to deliver future AIPAC messages to our visitors. As is true of most web sites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files.  This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users’ movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We do not link this automatically-collected data to personal information. You may opt out of Google's use of cookies by visiting the Google Analytics Opt-out page.

The use of cookies by our partners, affiliates, or service providers is not covered by our privacy policy.  We do have access or control over some of these cookies.  Our partners, affiliates, or service providers use session ID and persistent cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our site.

  AIPAC uses Web beacons alone or in conjunction with cookies to compile information about your usage of our web site and interaction with emails from AIPAC. Web beacons are clear electronic images that can recognize certain types of information on your computer, such as cookies, when you viewed a particular Web site tied to the Web beacon, and a description of a Web site tied to the Web beacon. For example, AIPAC may place Web beacons in marketing emails that notify the Company when you click on a link in the email that directs you to our Web site. AIPAC uses Web beacons to operate and improve the Company’s Web site and email communications.

Our third party partners employ clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), images, and scripts that help them better manage content on our site. We do not tie the information gathered to our Customers’ or Users’ personal information.

**Testimonials**

We may display personal testimonials on our site in addition to other endorsements.  With your consent we may post your testimonial along with your name.  If you wish to update or delete your testimonial, you can contact us at [membership@aipac.org](mailto:membership@aipac.org).

Our Site includes links to other Web sites whose privacy practices may differ from those of AIPAC. If you submit personal information to any of those sites, your information is governed by their privacy policies. We encourage you to carefully read the privacy policy of any Web site you visit. 

**Social Media Features**

Our Web site includes Social Media Features, such as the Facebook Like button and Widgets, such as the Share this button or interactive mini-programs that run on our site. These Features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our site, and may set a cookie to enable the Feature to function properly. Social Media Features and Widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Site. Your interactions with these Features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.
