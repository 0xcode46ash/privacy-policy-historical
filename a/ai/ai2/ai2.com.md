# Privacy Information

 

  


#####  Privacy for Web Visitors

One can visit our Web sites with privacy.  A Web site visitor can choose to provide customer-specific information by sending us e-mail, registering our company Web site, or entering surveys.  Any information provided by a Web site visitor is held strictly confidential within Ai2, or its authorized agent and will not be sold to any other organization or business.

#####  Types of Customer Information

On some Web pages users can make requests or register to receive information.  Such customer-specific information will be used to fulfill the specific request or purpose for which it was provided.  In addition, such voluntarily provided information may be occasionally used to offer products and services that may be of interest.

#####  Privacy of Online Personal Information

While Ai2 may use this information to contact or send materials to you for marketing purposes, we will take commercially reasonable steps to safeguard the information from unauthorized access.  We will not make customer-specific information that is gathered on our site available to unaffiliated organizations for commercial purposes unrelated to the business of Ai2, except with the customer’s permission, as required by law, for safety reasons or to survey customer satisfaction, under nondisclosure protection.  We do not share that information with outside parties.  We may also use that information to offer other products or services of interest.  We do not sell customer information from our Web sites to any outside party.

#####  Use of Customer Information

Information collected online may be used within Ai2 to inform the user about services and products of potential interest.  Customers might be contacted by telephone, direct mail or e-mail to keep them up-to-date on new products and services offered by Ai2.

#####  Data Security

To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy and appropriate use of information, appropriate physical, electronic and managerial safeguards have been established to secure the information collected online.

#####  Cookies

The term “cookie” refers to the files that are transferred from a Web site to your computer’s hard drive.  The purpose of cookies is to enable the host Web site to display tailored information to you and to track your activities on the Web site.  Some (usually newer) versions of web browsers allow you to decide whether or not to accept cookie files, and some programs notify you when a Web site is about to deposit a cookie file on your hard drive or receive cookie files selectively.  You can check your hard drive for cookie files.  For PCs, look for “cookies.txt” files on your hard drive.  On a Macintosh, look for “magic cookies.”

#####  Other Web Sites

The Web sites of Ai2 may contain links to other Web sites.  We are not responsible for the content or privacy policies of other sites.

#####  Correction of Information

To correct any inaccuracies, please contact us via [e-mail](mailto:sales@ai2.com).
