# Privacy Policy | Football Federation of Australia

**Football Federation Australia Limited (FFA)** recognises that privacy is important and that an individual has the right to control his or her Personal Information. FFA is committed to protecting the privacy of individuals on whom it collects Personal Information.

FFA’s Privacy Policy is based on the National Privacy Principles (NPPs) in the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) and governs how FFA handles the personal information FFA collects, uses, discloses and stores in relation to:

(a) football participants, including Players, Officials and Agents (Participants);  
(b) persons who register for any FFA sanctioned accreditation or licensing program;  
(c) persons who purchase tickets to Matches, including National Championship, National League and National Team Matches; or  
(d) persons who register to any football membership program, participation program, newsletter or promotional offer;

(collectively referred to as Constituents).

This policy relates to Personal Information on Constituents.

 **1\. COLLECTION**

1.1 FFA will not collect personal information from a Constituent unless the information is necessary for one or more of FFA’s functions or activities.

1.2 FFA collects personal information about a Constituent for the following primary purposes:

(a) compliance with FFA Statutes, including the administration and development of football (if the Constituent is a Participant);  
(b) organisation, conduct and promotion of Competitions and Matches;  
(c) communication by Football Administrators to a Constituent; and  
(d) disclosure to Football Partners (unless a Constituent has indicated that he or she does not want to receive any communication from Football Partners).

1.3 FFA collects personal information about a Constituent in a number of ways, including:

(a) directly from a Constituent, for example, when he/she provides information to FFA by phone, email, in an application form or through FFA’s websites (including www.footballaustralia.com.au; www.footballfamily.com.au; and www.myfootballclub.com.au); and  
(b) from third parties, such as a Football Administrator.

1.4 Where it is reasonable and practicable to do so, FFA will collect personal information about Constituents only from the Constituent. If that Constituent is a Minor, FFA may collect personal information from that Minor’s parent or legal guardian.

1.5 If FFA collects personal information about a Constituent from someone other than the Constituent (or the Constituent’s parent or legal guardian), FFA must take reasonable steps to ensure the Constituent is made aware of the matters listed in clause 1.6, except to the extent that making the individual aware of those matters would pose a serious threat to the life or health of any individual.

1.6 Before or at the time of collection of personal information (or if that is not practicable, as soon as practicable after), FFA must take reasonable steps to ensure that the individual is aware of:

(a) the identity of FFA and how to contact it;  
(b) the fact that the Constituent can gain access to the information held on him or her;  
(c) the purposes for which the information is collected;  
(d) the organisations (or types of organisations) to which FFA usually discloses information of that kind;  
(e) any law that requires the information to be collected; and  
(f) the main consequences (if any) for the Constituent if all or part of the information is not provided.

For the purposes of assisting compliance with this requirement, FFA keeps a register of standard forms containing the required notice for the particular purpose for which the information is collected. Where directed by FFA, Member Federations, Competition Administrators and Clubs must use these forms.

 **2\. USE AND DISCLOSURE**

2.1 FFA will not use or disclose personal information about a Constituent for a purpose other than the primary purpose of collection (the secondary purpose) unless:

(a) the Constituent has consented to the use or disclosure;  
(b) both of the following apply:  
(i) the secondary purpose is related to the primary purpose of collection and, if the personal information is sensitive information, directly related to the primary purpose of collection; and  
(ii) the Constituent would reasonably expect FFA to use or disclose the information for the secondary purpose;  
(c) FFA reasonably believes that the use or disclosure is necessary to lessen or prevent:  
(i) a serious and imminent threat to an individual’s life, health or safety; or  
(ii) a serious threat to public health or public safety;  
(d) FFA has reason to suspect that unlawful activity has been, is being or may be engaged in, and uses or discloses the personal information as a necessary part of its investigation of the matter or in reporting its concerns to relevant persons or authorities;  
(e) the use or disclosure is required or authorised by or under law; or  
(f) FFA reasonably believes that the use or disclosure is reasonably necessary for one or more of the purposes specified in NPP 2.1(h) by or on behalf of a law enforcement body. If FFA uses or discloses personal information on this basis, it must make a written note of the use or disclosure.

2.2 FFA may use the personal information of Constituents for the secondary purpose of direct communication by a football administrator with which the Constituent has an indirect relationship, if FFA has the consent of the Constituent for such use. In other cases, if the information is not sensitive information, FFA may use the information for the secondary purpose of direct communication only if the following are satisfied:

(a) it is impracticable to seek the Constituent’s consent before that use;  
(b) FFA will not charge the Constituent for giving effect to a request by that Constituent not to receive direct communications;  
(c) the Constituent has not made a request to FFA not to receive direct communication;  
(d) FFA always prominently displays a notice that the Constituent may express a wish not to receive any further direct communication; and  
(e) each written direct communication by FFA with the Constituent sets out FFA’s contact details including business address, telephone and fax numbers, and email address.

2.3 FFA may disclose personal information to ticketing agents, mailhouses or other similar organisations for the purpose of implementing the primary purposes, including implementing ticket requests and communicating football-related offers. FFA requires these organisations to keep contact details confidential and only use them for the designated purpose.

2.4 Despite clause 2.1, FFA may disclose health information about a Participant to a person who is responsible for that Participant if:

(a) the Participant:  
(i) is physically or legally incapable of giving consent to the disclosure; or  
(ii) physically cannot communicate consent to the disclosure;  
(b) a natural person (the carer) providing a health service for FFA is satisfied that either:  
(i) the disclosure is necessary to provide appropriate care or treatment of a Participant; or  
(ii) the disclosure is made for compassionate reasons;  
(c) the disclosure is not contrary to any wish:  
(i) expressed by a Participant before a Participant became unable to give or communicate consent; and  
(ii) of which the carer is aware, or of which the carer could reasonably be expected to be aware; and  
(d) the disclosure is limited to the extent reasonable and necessary for a purpose mentioned in paragraph (b).

2.5 For the purposes of clause 2.4, a person is responsible for a Participant if the person is in relation to that Participant:

(a) a parent or guardian;  
(b) a child or sibling and at least 18 years old;  
(c) a spouse or de facto spouse;  
(d) a relative, at least 18 years old and a member of the Participant’s household;  
(e) exercising an enduring power of attorney granted by the Participant that is exercisable in relation to decisions about the Participant’s health;  
(f) a person who has an intimate personal relationship with the Participant; or  
(g) a person nominated by the Participant to be contacted in case of emergency.

 **4\. DATA SECURITY**

4.1 FFA will take reasonable steps to protect the personal information it holds from misuse and loss and from unauthorised access, modification or disclosure.

4.2 Where FFA enters into a contract with any person and FFA’s personal information about Constituents could be disclosed to or otherwise accessed by that contractor, FFA must include provisions protecting privacy of that information in the contract. FFA General Counsel must be consulted for more specific contractual provisions contemplating the disclosure of FFA’s personal information on Constituents to contractors.

4.3 FFA will take reasonable steps to destroy or permanently de identify personal information if it is no longer needed for any purpose for which the information may be used or disclosed under clause 2.

 **5\. OPENNESS**

5.1 On a Constituent’s request, FFA will take reasonable steps to let that Constituent know, generally, what sort of personal information it holds, for what purposes, and how it collects, holds, uses and discloses that information. Generally, all such requests by Constituents should be directed to the FFA General Counsel.

5.2 FFA will set out in a document clearly expressed policies on its management of personal information.

 **6\. ACCESS AND CORRECTION**

6.1 FFA will provide a Constituent with access to the personal information it holds on that Constituent on request by that Constituent, except to the extent that FFA is not required to do so under NPP 6: Access and Correction.

6.2 All requests for access to and/or correction of personal information by a Constituent must be immediately directed to the FFA General Counsel. In assessing the request for access and/or correction, the FFA General Counsel must observe and comply with the procedures in clause 6 of this policy.

6.3 Before supplying any personal information to a Constituent FFA must be reasonably satisfied as to the identity of the Constituent (for example, by asking to see the Constituent’s passport or driver’s licence).

 **7\. IDENTIFIERS**

7.1 FFA will not adopt as its own identifier an identifier of a Constituent that has been assigned by a Commonwealth government agency or any person on behalf of a Commonwealth agency.

identifier includes a number assigned by an organisation to uniquely identify a Constituent for the purposes of the organisation’s operations. However, a Constituent’s name is not an identifier.

 **8\. ANONYMITY**

Wherever it is lawful and practicable, a Constituent (other than a Participant for registration purposes) will have the option of not identifying himself or herself when entering transactions with FFA.

 **9\. TRANSBORDER DATA FLOWS**

9.1 FFA may transfer personal information about a Constituent to someone who is in a foreign country only if:

(b) the transfer is necessary for the performance of a contract between that Constituent and FFA, or for the implementation of pre contractual measures taken in response to a Constituent’s request;  
(c) the transfer is necessary for the conclusion or performance of a contract concluded in the interest of that Constituent between FFA and a third party;  
(d) all of the following apply:  
(i) the transfer is for the benefit of a Constituent;  
(ii) it is impracticable to obtain the consent of a Constituent to that transfer; and  
(iii) if it were practicable to obtain such consent, a Constituent would be likely to give it; or  
(e) FFA has taken reasonable steps to ensure that the information that it has transferred will not be held, used or disclosed by the recipient of the information inconsistently with the NPPs (for example, by adopting appropriate contractual clauses).

9.2 Clause 9.1 does not apply to the transfer of personal information in accordance with FFA Statutes, including to facilitate the registration of a Player by an international football association.

 **10\. SENSITIVE INFORMATION**

10.1 FFA will not collect sensitive information about a Constituent who is not also a Participant.
