**Cookies**

Cookies are pieces of information that a website can transfer to an individual's computer hard drive for record keeping.  Cookies can make using websites easier to use by storing information about your preferences on a particular website.  The information remains on your computer after the Internet session finishes.

ATO _assist_ only uses cookies in a very limited way, to maintain navigation information during your site visit. With the exception of the Legal Database, these cookies will not remain on your computer at the end of each Internet session. The Legal Database saves cookies to your hard drive so that they are available next time you use the Legal Database. These cookies record details of search results and viewed documents to make your navigation easier on subsequent visits to the Legal Database. The ATO does not record this information.

Most Internet browsers are pre-set to accept cookies.  If you prefer not to receive cookies, you can adjust your Internet browser to refuse cookies or to warn you when cookies are being used.

## Security of information

Taxation Acts have secrecy provisions that prohibit any officer of the ATO (or any other government department) from accessing, recording or disclosing anyone's taxation information except in performing their duties or in specific situations permitted by taxation laws. There are severe penalties imposed for breaking these provisions. 

Your personal information will not be released unless the law permits it or your permission is given. We provide a secure environment and a reliable system but you should be aware that there may be inherent risks associated with the transmission of information via the Internet. For those who do not wish to use the Internet, the ATO provides alternative ways of obtaining and providing information. In some circumstances, the ATO security guidelines may also require us to send particular informaiton by non-electronic means.
