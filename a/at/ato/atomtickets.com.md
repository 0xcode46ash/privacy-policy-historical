### ATOM TICKETS PRIVACY POLICY

Last Updated: September 13, 2016

Welcome to Atom Tickets! Atom Tickets, LLC (" **Atom Tickets** ", " **We** ," " **Us** ", or " **Our** ") has prepared this Privacy Policy to describe its practices regarding the information We collect from users of Our mobile application (" **App** ") and website located at [www.atomtickets.com](https://www.atomtickets.com/) (" **Website** "), and the related online services provided by Atom Tickets through Our App or Our Website (" **Services** ").

If You, as defined in the [Terms of Use](https://www.atomtickets.com/tos), have any questions, concerns, or complaints about Our Privacy Policy or Our information collection or processing practices, or if You want to report any security violations to us, please contact Us at [ privacy@atomtickets.com](mailto:%20privacy@atomtickets.com). So We are clear about the terminology We are using, when We use the phrase " **Personal Information** " in this Privacy Policy, We mean information that allows someone to identify or contact You, including, your name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, as well as any other information that permits a specific individual to be contacted physically or online. When We use the phrase " **Anonymous Information** " in this Privacy Policy, We mean information that is not associated with or linked to Your Personal Information. Anonymous Information does not enable identification of or contact with individual persons.

Please read this policy carefully to understand Our policies and practices regarding Your information and how We will treat it. If You do not agree with Our policies and practices, do not download, register with, or use the App. By downloading, registering with, or using this App, You agree to this privacy policy. This policy may change from time to time. Your continued use of this App after We make changes is deemed to be acceptance of those changes, so please check the policy periodically for updates.

**Children’s Use of Atom Tickets’ Services**

Our Services are not directed to children and children are not eligible to use Our Services. Protecting the privacy of children is very important to Us. We do not collect or maintain Personal Information from people We actually know are under 13 years of age, and no part of Our Services are designed to attract people under 13 years of age. If We later learn that a user is under 13 years of age, We will take steps to remove that user's Personal Information from Our databases and to prevent the user from utilizing the Services.

**Information Atom Tickets Collects from Customers**

_Personal Information_

In general, the Personal Information We collect enables Us to better provide Our Services to You and helps Us learn more about the use of Our Services. We collect Personal Information that You submit to Us voluntarily at registration, through special offers, and in the course of Your use of Our Services. To use certain features of the Services, We require You to create an " **Account** " by providing Your name, phone number, and a password. When You purchase Tickets or Concessions, We will collect all information necessary to process the transaction.

When You communicate with Us or otherwise interact with publicly available areas of Our Services, including posting comments, ratings, or reviews, We will collect and store any information that is contained in Your communications and/or comments. Any information You choose to provide when using the Services should reflect how much You want other Users to know about You. You can choose not to provide Us with certain information, but this may limit the features of the Services You are able to use.

As You use the App, We may collect location-based information from You through Your mobile or other location-aware device. Certain of Our Services are location-specific and can provide helpful information based on where You are. If You tell Us where You are (i.e., by allowing Your mobile device to send Us Your location), We may use that information to provide You with location-based information. If You want to deactivate this feature, You can disable location services on Your mobile device, but We will not be able to provide those Services. Please contact Your carrier for more information.

_Information Collected from You About Others_

If You purchase Tickets for others or share Your plans with them, You can choose to provide and We collect the names, phone numbers and/or email addresses, and photographs of those people. We rely upon You to obtain whatever consents from the third party that may be required by law to allow Us to access and upload such third party information. You or the third party may contact Us at [ privacy@atomtickets.com](mailto:%20privacy@atomtickets.com) to request the removal of this information from Our database. As this is associated with You, We consider it to be Personal Information.

_Information Collected through Social Networking Services_

We may create interfaces that allow You to connect with social networking services ("SNS"), such as Facebook, through Our Services. We work with the SNS’s application protocol interface (better known as their developer API) in a way that allows You to authorize Us to access Your account on that SNS on Your behalf. In order to provide this authorization, You do not provide Us with Your user name or password to the SNS, but You will need to log-in to that SNS directly through Our Services. Once authorized by You, the SNS provides Us a token that allows the SNS to recognize Us when We ask, on Your behalf, for access to Your account information or to post information. For example, when You click "Connect" to grant Us access to Your Facebook account, We will import Your name and other information from Facebook and, as You use Our Services, We may periodically check for updates to such information. You can revoke Our access to any SNS at any time by amending the appropriate settings from within Your account settings on the applicable SNS.

_Anonymous Information_

We collect the following types of Anonymous Information:

_Information Collected by Our Servers_. To make Our Services more useful to You, Our servers (which may be hosted by a third party service provider) collect information from You, including Your browser type, operating system, Internet Protocol (" **IP** ") address (a number that is automatically assigned to Your computer when You use the Internet, which may vary from session to session), domain name, and/or a date/time stamp for Your visit.

_Log Files_. As is true of most apps and websites, We gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes IP addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (" **ISP** "), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. We use this information to analyze trends, administer the Services, track users’ use of the Services, gather demographic information about Our user base as a whole, and better tailor Our Services to Our users’ needs. For example, some of the information may be collected so that when You visit the Services again, it will recognize You and the information could then be used to serve advertisements and other information tailored to Your interests.

_Cookies_. Like many online services, We use cookies to collect information. " **Cookies** " are small pieces of information that a website sends to Your computer’s or device’s hard drive while You are viewing the website. We may use both session Cookies (which expire once You close the web browser) and persistent Cookies (which stay on Your computer or mobile device until You delete them) to provide You with a more personal and interactive experience on Our Services. This type of information is collected to make the Services (and those of third parties) more useful to You and to tailor Your experience with Us to address Your special interests and needs. If You decide at any time that You no longer wish to accept cookies from Our Services for any of the purposes described above, then You can instruct Your browser, by changing its settings, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt You before accepting a cookie from the websites or apps You visit. Consult Your browser’s technical information. If You do not accept cookies, however, You may not be able to use all of the Services or access certain features of the Services. If You have any questions about how to disable or modify cookies, please let Us know by contacting Us at [ privacy@atomtickets.com](mailto:%20privacy@atomtickets.com).

_Mobile Device_. We may collect information about the computer or device You use to access Our Services, including the hardware model, operating system and version, MAC address, advertising device identifier, phone number, and mobile network information. In addition, the Services may access Your device’s image storage applications and contacts, with Your consent, to facilitate Your use of certain features of the Services. For more information about how You can control Our access to these applications, please see "Your Choices" below.

_Pixel Tags_. In addition, We may use " **Pixel Tags** " (also referred to as clear Gifs, Web beacons, or Web bugs). Pixel Tags are tiny graphic images with a unique identifier, similar in function to Cookies, that are used to track online movements of online users. In contrast to Cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, Pixel Tags are embedded invisibly in apps and Web pages. Pixel Tags also allow Us to send e-mail messages and in-app advertisements in a format users can read, and they tell Us whether e-mails have been opened and in-app advertisements viewed to ensure that We are sending only messages that are of interest to Our users. We may use this information to reduce or eliminate messages sent to a user. We may allow third-party advertisers or partners to use Pixel Tags on the App for the same reasons and in the same methods identified above. We do not tie the information gathered by Pixel Tags to Our users’ Personal Information, nor do We provide enough information to third parties for them to do so.

_Collection of Information by Advertisers_. We may use third parties to serve ads on the Services. Certain third parties may automatically collect information about Your visits to the App and other apps and websites, Your IP address, Your ISP, Your advertising device identifier, and/or the browser You use to visit Our Services (but not Your name, address, e-mail address, or telephone number). They do this by using Cookies, Pixel Tags or other technologies. Information collected may be used, among other things, to deliver advertising targeted to Your interests and to better understand the usage and visitation of Our Services and the other sites tracked by these third parties. This policy does not apply to, and We are not responsible for, Cookies or Pixel Tags in third party ads, and We encourage You to check the privacy policies of advertisers and/or ad services to learn about their use of Cookies and other technologies. If You would like more information about this practice and to know Your choices about not having this information used by these companies, click here: <http://www.aboutads.info/choices>.

**Anonymous Information**

With the exception of the examples above, the information We share with third parties is limited to Anonymous Information. We use the Anonymous Information We collect to analyze trends, administer and improve the Services, track users’ movements in the App, gather demographic information about Our user base as a whole, and better tailor Our Services (and those of third parties) to Our users’ and potential users’ needs. For example, some of the Log Files may be collected so that when You use the App again, it will recognize You and the information could then be used to make available information tailored to Your interests. We reserve the right to disclose Anonymous Information publicly without restriction.

We also share Anonymous Information with advertisers. Because We share only Anonymous Information with advertisers, advertisers are unable to identify You through this information. Also, the Anonymous Information We share with advertisers is aggregated, subject to the rest of this privacy policy. When you interact with or click on an advertisement, however, you give the advertiser your personal information, and the advertiser may be able to identify you as being a member of the demographic group that the ad is targeting.

We may also share Anonymous Information with third party tracking services ("Tracking Services") to help Us analyze how users use the Services. These Tracking Services collect only the advertising device identifier assigned to Your mobile device, rather than Your name or other personally identifiable information, and use it to collect information such as how often users open the App and what features they use in the App. We only use this information to improve Our Services and to better tailor Our offerings and Services (and those of third parties, such as movie studios) to You. We do not combine the information generated thereby with Your Personal Information and We do not associate You in any way with Your device identifier. The collection of this information does not enable these Tracking Services to personally identify or contact You.

We may also share Anonymous Information with third party service providers ("Analytics Companies") to help analyze how users use Our Services. These Analytics Companies use Cookies and/or Pixel Tags to collect information such as how often users visit Our Services and how they use Our Services. We do not combine the information gathered through the use of Analytics Companies with Your Personal Information, and the collection of this information does not enable these Analytics Companies to identify or contact You.
