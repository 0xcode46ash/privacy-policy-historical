We are firmly committed to your privacy. The following policy statement describes our information gathering and dissemination practices for the Atomica client, Palm version and Web-site **www.atomica.com**.

  * Overview
  * What We Track
  * Cookies
  * Security
  * Choice / Opt Out
  * Additional Information



### _Overview_

Atomica's policy is to respect and protect the privacy of our users. Atomica does not willfully disclose individually identifiable information about its customers to any third party without first receiving that customer's permission. This policy statement tells you how we collect information from you and how we use it.

Atomica may share information about users with advertisers, business partners, sponsors, and other third parties. However, we only do so in _aggregate_ , not as individuals. For example, we may disclose how frequently the average Atomica user activates our product, or how frequently we display a given concept.

Atomica requests information from you on the registration page, and may again request information when attempting to provide customized features. All personal information upon registration is _optional_. When using certain customized features, though, additional information (e.g., e-mail) may be required. 

If you ever regret providing Atomica with information, please send e-mail to [support@atomica.com](mailto:support@atomica.com) and we will delete the information from our database.

### _What We Track_

When you download Atomica, we generate a User-ID for you. The only thing this ID tracks is your usage of Atomica. Specifically:

  * What topics we've displayed for you 
  * What links you've clicked on from within the Atomica window 



In addition, when a user registers with us, we request the following optional information: age, gender, country, zip, e-mail.

We collect this information for the following purposes:

  * To help us provide you more relevant information. 
  * To better understand how people use our product, so that we can improve their experience. 
  * To allow third parties to view, on an _aggregate_ basis only, information regarding usage patterns. None of this information can be traced back to an individual user. 



We will never voluntarily transfer any personally identifiable information to a third party.

### _Cookies_

Atomica uses cookies to store some of your preferences. For example, you may select _French_ as your preferred user interface language. You can use Atomica even if cookies are disabled, but we will then be unable to adapt our services to your preferences.

### _Security_

Atomica operates secure data networks protected by industry standard security protection systems. Our security and privacy policies are periodically reviewed and enhanced as necessary and only authorized individuals have access to the information provided by our users.

### _Choice / Opt Out_

Upon registration, Atomica provides users the opportunity to opt out of receiving communications from us and our partners. We also allow our users to remove their information from our database to prevent future receipt of communications or to no longer receive our service.
