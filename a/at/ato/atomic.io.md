# Atomic: Privacy Policy

This Policy was last updated on 25 November 2015.

This update included a small number of edits to align it with revisions made at the same time to the [Atomic Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/terms). Key changes from the previous edition include:

  * updating the terms used to describe user accounts and account status to make them simpler and easier to understand; and

  * updating section 6 with a reference to related information contained within the [Atomic Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/terms).




_1._ **Your privacy**

_1.1._ Atomic is a software as a service design collaboration system provided by Atomic.io Limited (New Zealand Company Number 4917919) (“ **us** ”, “ **we** ”) at atomic.io (“ **Atomic** ”). Atomic has two types of users,

a) those who can log into our application where they may be able to create work using the Atomic software and who can comment on their own and others’ work on Atomic (“ **Account Holders** ”) and;

b) those who do not have log in details to Atomic but can view work created by others and browser other areas of the Atomic website without signing in (“ **Viewers** ”).

_1.2._ We do our best to protect your privacy, and to treat your personal information as required by the New Zealand Privacy Act 1993. We want to make sure that you understand how your personal information is used so please read this Privacy Policy carefully.

_2._ **Application of this Privacy Policy**

_2.1._ This Privacy Policy applies to all personal information that you submit through Atomic or to us directly, and any personal information that may be retrieved through your use of Atomic.

_2.2._ By accessing or using Atomic, you consent to the collection, use, disclosure, storage and processing of your personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If you don’t agree to this policy, you must not use Atomic.

_3._ **What information we collect about you**

_3.1._ We collect personal information about you when you create an account (whether it be a Design Account or a Reviewer Account) and when you access and use Atomic. In particular we will collect:

  * your IP address and/or other device identifying data; and
  * other information required to provide a service you requested.



_3.2._ You are under no obligation to provide us with any such information. However, if you choose to withhold requested information, we may not be able to provide you with certain services or functionality.

_3.3._ We may use cookies to collect this information. Cookies are small pieces of information that are stored in a browser-related file on your computer’s hard drive when you use Atomic.

_3.4._ You can stop the collection of your information by permanently deleting your account and by ceasing to use our services. However, under New Zealand law, we may retain personal information for as long as is required for the purposes described in clause 4 below.

_4._ **What we do with the information we collect**

_4.1._ We will use the personal information we collect, and may share such personal information with other entities (such as service providers) to:

  * provide our services (including retaining your data and content when you temporarily suspend your account);
  * identify you when you sign-in to your account and verify that your account is not being used by others;
  * carry out research and analysis so we can better understand and serve you;
  * personalise content, advertisements or links relevant to your geographic area or device-type;
  * gather broad anonymous demographic data (such as the number of visitors from a geographic area);
  * communicate with you in relation to Atomic and any other services we provide from time to time;
  * enforce compliance with our [Terms](https://web.archive.org/terms);

_4.4._ We may choose to sell our business. In these types of transactions, your information is typically one of the business assets transferred to the third party purchaser. You acknowledge and agree that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of us or our assets may continue to use your personal information as set out in this Privacy Policy.
