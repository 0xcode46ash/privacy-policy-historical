###  Welcome to the plane of A'therys, mortal. 

You have arrived at an auspicious time. For seven thousand years, gods have ruled the men of the Mortal Plane, an Age of Balance unchanging across the eons. But no more. As the Second Calling dawned, the gods were called from the plane, leaving humanity to its own devices.

Where in this strife will you stand? Close to the strongholds of the six nations, serving in military or economy? Perhaps a greater organization beckons to you, a guild of knowledge or shadow? Or will you forge your own path, as the Mortal Heroes once did, ignoring your fellow man and the few lingering gods in the world? These choices are but the beginning, Adventurer. Take up your mantle of sword or sorcery, sharp wit or strength immeasurable, and awaken from your slumber. A'therys awaits.
