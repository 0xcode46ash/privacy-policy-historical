## KEY TERMS

  * **COOKIES:** Cookies are small amounts of text files that are sent from a website to your computer’s browser when you visit the site. These cookies are then stored in files within your computer’s browser. Web sites can access only the cookies that they have stored on your computer. For example, if the Acme Computer Company stores a cookie on your browser, Acme may access its own cookie to improve the user’s online experience, but it could not access any cookies belonging to another company. For every future time you access the website, your browser sends the cookie back to the server, which notifies the website of the user’s previous activities on the website. Thus, cookies serve several useful purposes, like letting you navigate between pages more efficiently, saving your preferences, and enhancing your user experience with the website.
  * **WEB BEACONS:** Web beacons (also called transparent GIFs, web bugs, pixels, or action tags) are strings of code that deliver a tiny graphic image on a web page or in an email which is used to monitor the behavior of the user visiting the website or sending the email. Web beacons can recognize certain types of information on your computer such as cookies, the time and date a page is viewed, and a description of the page on which the web beacon is placed. In general, any file served as part of a web page can act as a web beacon. We use web beacons for various tracking purposes, like determining whether or not you are logged into the site and whether or not you are connected to a third-party service.
  * **INTERNET PROTOCOL (IP) ADDRESS:** A numerical label separated by periods that identifies every device (e.g., computer, printer) that participates in a network. IP addresses allow these devices to communicate with one another and transmit relevant information.
  * **PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION (PII):** PII includes: first and last name; physical mailing address including street name and city/town; email; telephone number; Social Security Number; and any other identifier that permits the physical or online contacting of a specific individual.
