# Privacy Policy | At Home Web

By using this Website and/or providing any information, you signify your consent to the collection, use and sharing practices described in this Privacy Policy.

### Types of Information Collected

We collect certain personal and non-personal information that you provide to Us when using this Website.

Personal information that you provide to Us, such as your full name, street address, e-mail address and telephone number, is collected, stored and used only for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy or as otherwise disclosed at the time We request such information from you. This personal information also may be used to contact you about sales, special offers and new site features, unless you have opted not to receive promotional communications in connection with this Website.

We also collect non-personal information about users of the Website. The non-personal information we collect on this Website is information that by itself cannot be used to identify or contact you, such as demographic information and other anonymous statistical data relating to the use of this Website. For example, we collect and store certain non-personal information automatically whenever you interact with this Website, including your IP address, browser information and reference site domain name. We also collect non-personal information regarding customer traffic patterns and site usage. This information is used to analyze and improve this Website and to provide Our customers with a more fulfilling shopping experience.

### A Special Note to Parents

We realize children under the age of eighteen (18) may visit the Website and encourage all children to consult with their parents prior to submitting any information to any website, including Ours. We encourage parents to supervise their children’s online activities and consider using parental control tools available from online services and software manufacturers that help provide a child-friendly online environment. These tools can also prevent children from disclosing their name, address and other personal information online without parental permission.

### Cookies, Web Beacons and Targeted Advertising

Like many websites, We use “cookies,” which are files stored on your computer’s hard drive by your browser. These cookies help Us identify Our account holders and allow us to better optimize their shopping experience. Cookies do not include any data that will identify you personally. Most browsers accept cookies automatically, but allow you to disable them if you wish.

Most browsers provide you with the option to set your browser to accept all cookies, to notify you when a cookie is issued, or to not receive cookies at any time. If you opt not to receive any cookies, certain personalized services cannot be provided to you and accordingly you may not be able to take full advantage of all of the features on Our Website.

We may use third-party advertising companies to provide Us with data collection and reporting services regarding Our guests’ activities on Our Website, tracking and measuring performance of Our marketing efforts and your response to Our marketing efforts, and the delivery of relevant marketing messages. These companies may employ cookies and action tags (also known as single pixel gifs or web beacons) to measure advertising effectiveness and may receive information about your browsing and buying activity on Our Website. Web beacons enable Us to recognize a browser’s cookie when a browser visits Our Website and to learn which banner ads bring users to Our Website. In addition, We and Our third party service providers may use cookies to manage and track the performance of Our advertisements displayed on other websites across the Internet.

Targeted advertising (also known as online behavioral advertising) uses information collected on an individual’s web browsing behavior, such as the pages they have visited or the searches they have made. This information is then used to select which of Our advertisements should be displayed to a particular individual on websites other than this Website. The information collected is only linked to an anonymous cookie ID (alphanumeric number), and it does not include any information that could be linked back to a particular person, such as their name, address or credit card number. The information used for targeted advertising either comes from Us or through third party website publishers.

### Security

We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect the confidentiality and security of personal information transmitted to Us using this Website. To help guard your information, our Website uses Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). SSL encrypts your credit card number, name and address so only We are able to decode your information. Please note that e-mail is not encrypted and is not considered to be a secure means of transmitting credit card information.

To be sure your connection is secure, look at the bottom status bar of your browser window. If you see an unbroken key or a closed lock (depending on your browser) the SSL is active and your information is secure. Most browsers offer additional security alerts as well. If for some reason you are unable to connect to our secure server, please call us toll free at 832-391-7201.

We also ask customers to carefully review their accounts and immediately report any unexpected activity to Us and their issuing bank or credit card company. Additionally, We ask all our customers to take measures to help protect personal information in their online accounts, including the following:

  * Install the latest security updates and anti-virus software on your computer to help prevent malware and viruses
