# ATRL - Privacy Statement

ATRL cares about your privacy and would not take or use any information that you wouldn't willfully give to us.

**Registration**  
When registering for ATRL, you provide to us a user name, email address, and password. Your password is encrypted by vBulletin software and cannot be viewed by anyone, including administrators, though it can be reset to a random password by request if needed. When browsing or posting at ATRL, your computer's IP address is stored only to track abusive or duplicate members and will not be used for any other purpose.

**Who's Online**  
When visiting any page of ATRL, your computer's IP address and the location of the page that you are viewing is stored on the [Who's Online](http://www.atrl.net/forums/online.php) page for 15 minutes after the last page you have clicked on. Your IP address is only viewable by our staff (not any other visitors), only used to track how many people are visiting the site, and will not be used for any other purpose. Members can choose to be invisible to everyone while browsing the site, and have their IP address hidden as well, by selecting the corresponding option in ATRL's [My Preferences](http://www.atrl.net/forums/profile.php?do=editoptions) page.

**Cookies**  
ATRL uses cookies, small text files that are stored on your computer, to keep you signed in. By default, once you sign in, ATRL stores a cookie on your computer until you choose to sign out, keeping you automatically signed in otherwise. However, if you uncheck "Remember Me" when signing in, ATRL will only store a cookie temporarily while you are browsing, and you will be automatically signed out after 15 minutes of inactivity. If your browser does not support cookies, a session ID will be sent through each link to keep you signed in until you stop browsing or sign out.

**Email**  
From ATRL's [My Preferences](http://www.atrl.net/forums/profile.php?do=editoptions) page, members can choose how their email addresses will be used. By default, ATRL will use your email address to send you information about changes to the site, to notify you of replies to your subscribed threads, to respond to a question, and to check for duplicate members. Your email address will not be used for any other purpose. However, you can choose to opt out of all email communication from the [My Preferences](http://www.atrl.net/forums/profile.php?do=editoptions) page.

**Private Messages**  
ATRL also uses a private messaging system to provide members with various updates, and to allow members to easily communicate with each other. Although private messages and notes are stored in our server's database unencrypted, no one will read private messages that you have sent or received except for the intended recipient. If you wish, you can choose to opt out of all private message communication from ATRL's [My Preferences](http://www.atrl.net/forums/profile.php?do=editoptions) page.

**Advertisements**  
We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our website. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address, or telephone number) about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, click [here](http://www.google.com/privacy.html).

**vBulletin**  
For more information about vBulletin, the software that powers ATRL, including the member database, login system, and forums, visit the [vBulletin web site](http://www.vbulletin.com/).

**Contact Us**  
Check this page periodically for updates. If you have any questions about this privacy statement, please write to the [ATRL webmaster](http://www.atrl.net/forums/sendmessage.php).
