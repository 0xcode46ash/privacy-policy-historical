# Privacy policy | About us

We recognize that you have an interest in how we collect, retain and use information about you. A.T. Kearney has created this Privacy and Security Policy statement in order to demonstrate and communicate its commitment to doing business with the highest ethical standards and appropriate internal controls. 

Information on our users is obtained through user-submitted request-for-more information forms. These forms require users to give us contact information (such as name, company or school name, e-mail address, street address, telephone and fax numbers and educational information). This information is used to provide the information to those who inquire about our business and services offered or employment opportunities. We consider your data to be private and confidential, and we hold ourselves to the highest standards of trust in their safekeeping and use. 

Currently we do not collect any information about our website viewers through the use of “cookies” which are small pieces of information that are stored by your browser on your computer’s hard drive. If, however, in the future, we decide to use this technology, the information collected from “cookies” would be solely used for the purpose of better understanding our users and their use of the website. Your browser is probably set to accept cookies. However, if you would prefer not to receive cookies, you can alter the configuration of your browser to refuse cookies. If you choose to have your browser refuse cookies, it is possible that some areas of our website will not function properly when you view them. 

A.T. Kearney will not share or release information collected about you through this website to third parties, other than as stated above, unless we receive your prior written consent or we are required by law to release information to the recipient. A.T. Kearney may, however, produce internal reports that analyze user activity in anonymous aggregated form. 

Our website is protected with a variety of security measures. We employ a variety of mechanisms to ensure that data you provide is not lost, misused, or altered inappropriately [e.g., storing all data in a locked and guarded facility, using passwords, etc.]. 

If you wish to review or correct your personal, contact or demographic data or remove your name and related information from our records, please contact [insight@atkearney.com](mailto:insight@atkearney.com). You may opt out of any disclosure we may make to third parties in the future by sending email to [insight@atkearney.com](mailto:insight@atkearney.com). 

We do not knowingly collect any information from anyone under thirteen years of age. If you are under thirteen, please do not submit any information to our site.
