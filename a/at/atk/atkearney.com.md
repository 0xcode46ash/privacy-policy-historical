# Privacy Policy - A.T. Kearney

A.T. Kearney is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy and Security Policy describes how we collect, protect, and use information about you when you access and use A.T. Kearney websites, online applications, and digital communications. This statement sets out A.T. Kearney's commitment to doing business with the highest ethical standards and appropriate internal controls.

A.T. Kearney collects two types of information when you visit our websites: contact information and usage information.

#####  Contact information or "personally-identifiable information"

The information you provide on a user-submitted form is used to respond to and manage your request. Our contact forms only require information necessary for responding to, and managing, inquiries about our business and services, application for employment opportunities, or registration for events or conferences. This information might include, for example: name, company or school name, email address, street address, telephone number, educational information, and/or preferences for information.

We consider this information to be private and confidential. A.T. Kearney will not share or release information about you to third parties, unless we receive your prior written consent or we are required by law to release information to the recipient.

#####  Usage information

A.T. Kearney may collect information about your computer (including where available your IP address, operating system, and browser type) for system administration and to produce internal reports that analyze user activity on our websites. This information is anonymous and aggregated. Usage information helps us better understand how users come to our site, how they navigate, what they find interesting, etc. We use this information to improve our web content, navigation, and functionality.

A.T. Kearney may use "cookies" to keep track of your visit and use of our websites, facilitate your requests by automatically populating information that you have provided previously, and/or streamline your use of login information to certain password-protected portions of websites. A cookie is a small piece of information that is stored by your browser on your computer's hard drive. Your browser is probably set to accept cookies. However, if you would prefer not to receive cookies, you can alter the configuration of your browser to refuse cookies. If you choose to have your browser refuse cookies, it is possible that some areas of our website will not function properly when you view them.

We use Google Analytics to understand and improve our websites. Google Analytics uses cookies to compile website reports about user activity. Google does not provide information about individuals or their web use.

#####  No third-party emails

Some firms contract with third-party email providers to send emails to registered users. A.T. Kearney does not use an external email service. When you register (opt-in) to receive emails, we maintain user information on our secure servers.

#####  Unsubscribe or opt-out to mailings

Users opt-in for receiving emails from A.T. Kearney groups about goods, services, or other information that may be of interest to them, and they have the opportunity to change their preferences for types of information/communications or to opt-out at any time.

If you wish to review or correct your personal, contact, or demographic data or remove your name and related information from our records, you can contact us using the [Contact Us](https://web.archive.org/contact-us) form on the websites.

#####  Retention of information

In general, we will only store your personal information for as long as it is needed to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected, subject to applicable data retention periods imposed upon A.T. Kearney by applicable law.

#####  International transfer of information

A.T. Kearney is a global firm with websites that can be viewed and hosted anywhere in the world. Information collected from you through these sites and/or emails may occasionally be transferred to, and stored at, a destination anywhere in the world. It may also be transferred to or processed by staff operating in any of our offices throughout the world, e.g., for a global event or mailing. By using the websites and providing information, you voluntarily consent to such international transfer, storing or processing of such information.

#####  External links

Our websites contain links to external sites that are not covered by this privacy and security policy. A.T. Kearney does not have any responsibility for the practices of third-party sites. In general, our approach is not to link to external sites that require any information from you; however, these sites may make changes to their user registration at any time. Links to external sites does not mean that we endorse those sites or content.

#####  Video and audio conferencing content

Video, audio, and Web conference content may be recorded without notice by the A.T. Kearney personnel who host your meeting. If you do not wish to participate in a meeting where content is recorded, you should contact your meeting host prior to joining the meeting.

#####  Surveys

If you participate in a survey that is available through our websites or emails, all research results are reported as totals or in aggregate form. No information about individuals or individual companies is made public.

#####  Security measures

Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. However, our websites are protected with a variety of security measures. We employ a number of mechanisms to ensure that data you provide is not lost, misused, or altered inappropriately, e.g., storing all data in a locked and guarded facility, using passwords, etc. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our site and any transmission is at your own risk.

#####  Children's online privacy protection

We do not knowingly collect any information from anyone under thirteen years of age. If you are under thirteen, please do not submit any information to our sites.

#####  Changes to Policy

In the event that we update this Policy to reflect changes in our practices, we will revise the "last updated" date at the bottom of this statement. If there are material changes to this statement or in how A.T. Kearney will use your information, we will notify you either by prominently posting a notice of such changes prior to implementing the change or by sending a notice directly to you.

#####  Contact us

If you have any questions about this Privacy and Security Policy statement, the practices of our websites, or your dealings with our firm, you can contact us using the [Contact Us](https://web.archive.org/contact-us) form on the websites. We reserve the right to change this policy at any time by posting a new policy at this location.
