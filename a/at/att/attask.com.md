### Workfront On-Demand Software Data Security Policy

Workfront will use commercially reasonable efforts consistent with, and no less rigorous than, best industry practices to ensure that appropriate facility and data security procedures and processes are in place to protect against destruction, corruption, loss or alteration of, unauthorized access to, or interference with, any of the customer’s production and other data, accounts, systems, confidential information or customer data created and generated through the use of the Workfront software.

**Data Storage and Isolation.** Workfront will not store the customer’s data on unencrypted portable media such as laptop computers, external hard drives, USB drives, or other portable devices. The customer’s data will be properly isolated from all third party data. At no time will the customer’s data be housed on hardware shared by vendors other than Workfront (e.g. a shared web server used by several companies and maintained by a third party Internet service provider).

**Data Access.** Only the customers’ personnel have access to the application level data. Workfront’s system administrators and DBAs have access to raw data only, and, except for access given to Workfront personnel by the customer during the performance of services and support, no other Workfront personnel have access to the customer’s data.

**Data Transmission.** Workfront warrants that all transmissions of the customer’s data in the Workfront software will be properly encrypted in accordance with industry standards.

**Vulnerability Testing.** Workfront will perform regularly scheduled vulnerability assessments on the hosted Workfront software, including remediation procedures. Workfront will use application and system logging processes, and these logs will be stored, protected and reviewed on a regular basis.

**Disclosure Requests.** If a third party should request that Workfront disclose a customer’s data pursuant to a subpoena, summons, search warrant, court or governmental order, Workfront will provide the customer with immediate notice and, to the extent permissible by law, a reasonable opportunity to oppose release of the data prior to releasing any such data. If any disclosure is finally directed by a lawful order, Workfront will disclose only so much of the data as is necessary to meet the requirements thereof.

**Safe Harbor.** Workfront complies with the US-EU Safe Harbor Framework and the US-Swiss Safe Harbor Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information from European Union member countries and Switzerland.
