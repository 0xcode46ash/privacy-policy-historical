**AT &T’s Online Privacy Policy**

**_Customer Identifiable Information_**

|  | 

>    Protecting privacy is not a new endeavor for AT&T. AT&T has a long-standing tradition of recognizing and protecting the privacy of customers who use its telecommunications networks. The company maintains strict customer information privacy policies and uses state of the art technologies to safeguard customer information and communications from unauthorized intrusions.   
  
---|---  
  
AT&T recognizes that the growth of online services, including Internet services, has created additional privacy concerns, particularly for consumers. 

Online privacy concerns focus on the protection of "customer identifiable" information which an individual or other customer reasonably expects to be kept private. As the term suggests, "customer identifiable" information is information which can be associated with a specific individual or entity, including, for example, a customer’s name, address, or telephone number, e-mail address, and information about online activities that are directly linked to them.

It is common practice and often a necessity for companies, governments, or other organizations to collect customer identifiable information in order to conduct business and offer services. For example, a telecommunications provider may collect customer identifiable information, such as name, address, telephone number, and a variety of other information in the course of billing and providing telephone service to a customer.

Some activities on the Internet follow very familiar patterns. Consumers signing up for an Internet access service, for example, are usually asked to provide name, address, telephone number and credit card and other information that is typical when the consumer orders a product or service. Similarly, business web sites may ask visitors to supply information about themselves, particularly when information, services or merchandise are requested, but often simply to be able to better target the company's services to the customer's interests and requirements.

AT &T’s Online Privacy Policy: Informed Choice

_**

AT&T has put in place the following Online Privacy Policy to protect customer identifiable information. This policy covers AT&T and its subsidiaries, except as follows, and applies to all customer identifiable information that AT&T obtains when a customer registers for or uses an AT&T online service, including visiting an AT&T owned and controlled web site ("AT&T Web Site"). This policy does not apply to AT&T's recent acquisition of Telecommunications Inc. ("TCI"). We are currently evaluating TCI's privacy policy. AT&T will continue to protect customer information derived from its local, long distance, cable and wireless services consistent with federal laws and with federal regulations issued by the Federal Communications Commission.

**AT &T protects online customer identifiable information as follows:**

_****_

_**Disclosure**_. AT&T will not sell, trade, or disclose to third parties any customer identifiable information derived from the registration for or use of an AT&T online service -- including customer names and addresses -- without the consent of the customer (except as required by subpoena, search warrant, or other legal process or in the case of imminent physical harm to the customer or others). When AT&T uses other agents, contractors or companies to perform services on its behalf, AT&T will ensure that the company protects your customer identifiable information consistent with this Policy. If AT&T includes your name and any other customer identifiable information in a directory that AT&T creates from information we receive as an online service provider, the company will give you the opportunity to have your information excluded from that directory. Business directories that AT&T creates may, however, contain information obtained from other sources. 

**__**__

_**Collection and Use**_. AT&T will collect and use customer identifiable information for billing purposes, to anticipate and resolve problems with your service, or to create and inform you of products and services that better meet your needs. This means that AT&T may use your customer identifiable information, in conjunction with information available from other sources, to market new services to you that we think will be of interest to you, but we will not disclose your customer identifiable information to third parties who want to market products to you. 

**__**__

_**Customer Choice**_. A customer may choose not to receive direct marketing communications from AT&T in connection with AT&T online services. Upon such choice, AT&T (a) will not contact that customer directly with marketing messages about AT&T online services, and (b) will not use customer identifiable information obtained from that customer’s registration for or use of an online service to contact that customer with marketing messages about any AT&T products or services. A customer may choose not to receive such messages by e-mail, by mail, or by telephone.

Customer-identifiable information which a visitor volunteers at one of the AT&T Web Sites to order AT&T services other than online services will be protected just as if the information had been provided under more traditional ways of ordering that service.

**__**__

_**Collection of usage data**_. AT&T servers automatically gather information about which sites customers visit on the Internet and which pages are visited within an AT&T Web Site. The company does not use that information except in the aggregate. 

**__**__

_**Security**_. AT&T has implemented technology and security features and strict policy guidelines to safeguard the privacy of your customer identifiable information from unauthorized access or improper use, and we will continue to enhance our security procedures as new technology becomes available. 

**__**__

_**E-mail Contents**._ The company will not read or disclose to third parties private e-mail communications that are transmitted using AT&T services except as required to operate the service or as otherwise authorized by law.

**__**__

_**Improper Conduct**_. AT&T may also use customer identifiable information to investigate and help prevent potentially unlawful activity or activity that threatens the network or otherwise violates the customer agreement for that service. 

**__**__

_**Account Information**_. AT&T honors requests from customers for account information, for example, name, address, or billing information, and will correct any such information which may be inaccurate. Customers may verify that appropriate corrections have been made.

**_Customer Concerns_**. If you are a consumer with concerns about the AT&T online privacy policy or its implementation you may contact us at 1-888-9-ATT-WEB. If you are a business customer, please call 1-877-744-4531.

Additional Privacy Protections for Children Using the Internet

_**

AT&T joins the industry in recognizing that children, including young teens, may not be able to make informed choices about personal information requested online.

Accordingly, AT&T does not target children or teenagers (younger than eighteen years of age) for collection of information online. AT&T does not solicit or collect customer identifiable information targeted at children and teenagers under eighteen and does not allow anyone else to do so on an AT&T Web Site. In addition, the editorial content of AT&T Web Sites designed for children will not knowingly promote or link to any third party web site that collects customer identifiable information unless that web site publishes a privacy policy that is easily accessible.

In addition, on all of its online services and AT&T Web Sites, AT&T will encourage children to seek the consent of their parents before providing any information about themselves or their households to anyone on the Internet. 

Finally, AT&T encourages parents to take an active role to protect the privacy and security of their children and to prevent the inappropriate use of information about their children. AT&T supports the development of technologies that help parents to control the collection and use of personal information from children who use online services in their households.
