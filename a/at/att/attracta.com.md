**Definitions**

For purposes of this Policy, the following definitions shall apply:

**“Agent”** means any third party that collects or uses personal information under the instructions of, and solely for, Attracta or to which Attracta discloses personal information for use on Attracta’s behalf.

**“Attracta”** means Attracta, Inc., its predecessors, successors, subsidiaries, divisions and groups in the United States.

**“Personal information”** means any information or set of information that identifies or could be used by or on behalf of Attracta to identify an individual. Personal information does not include information that is encoded or anonymized, or publicly available information that has not been combined with non-public personal information.

**“Sensitive personal information”** means personal information that reveals race, ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership, views or activities, that concerns health or sex life, information about social security benefits, or information on criminal or administrative proceedings and sanctions other than in the context of pending proceedings. In addition, Attracta will treat as sensitive personal information any information received from a third party where that third party treats and identifies the information as sensitive.

**Choice:**  
Attracta will offer individuals the opportunity to choose (opt-out) whether their personal information is (a) to be disclosed to a non-agent third party, or (b) to be used for a purpose other than the purpose for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized by the individual.

For sensitive personal information, Attracta will give individuals the opportunity to affirmatively and explicitly (opt-in) consent to the disclosure of the information to a non-agent third party or the use of the information for a purpose other than the purpose for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized by the individual.

Attracta will provide individuals with reasonable mechanisms to exercise their choices.

**Data Integrity:**  
Attracta will use personal information only in ways that are compatible with the purposes for which it was collected or subsequently authorized by the individual. Attracta will take reasonable steps to ensure that personal information is relevant to its intended use, accurate, complete, and current.

**Transfers to Agents:**

Attracta will obtain assurances from its agents that they will safeguard personal information consistently with this Policy. Where Attracta has knowledge that an agent is using or disclosing personal information in a manner contrary to this Policy, Attracta will take reasonable steps to prevent or stop the use or disclosure.

**Access and Correction:**  
Upon request, Attracta will grant individuals reasonable access to personal information that it holds about them. In addition, Attracta will take reasonable steps to permit individuals to correct, amend, or delete information that is demonstrated to be inaccurate or incomplete.

**Security:**

Attracta will take reasonable precautions to protect personal information in its possession from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction.

**Enforcement:**  
Attracta will conduct annual compliance audits of its relevant privacy practices to verify adherence to this Policy. Any employee that Attracta determines is in violation of this policy will be subject to disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment.

**Application of Principles**

**The Information We Collect:**  
This notice applies to all information collected or submitted on the Attracta™ website. On some pages, you can order products, make requests, and register to receive materials. The types of personal information collected at these pages are:

  * Name
  * Address
  * Email address
  * Phone number
  * Credit/Debit Card Information



**The Way We Use Information:**  
We use the information you provide about yourself when placing an order or ordering service only to complete that order. We do not share this information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to complete that order.

We use return email addresses to answer the email we receive. Such addresses are not used for any other purpose and are not shared with outside parties.

When you register for service with our website you may receive email messages relating the services provided. You may also receive alerts when your service level has been exceeded.

We may use cookies to help identify your account, allowing faster access when you re-log in. Cookies are pieces of information generated by a web server or web hosting sites and stored on your computer for future access. We only give cookies for use for re-logging in, remembering you so you do not need to re-enter your login information. No name, email address or personal identifiable information is in the cookies, only a non-identifiable user ID code. By using our services and or products, you consent to our use of cookies for the purpose stated above.

We use non-identifying and aggregate information to better design our website and to share with advertisers. For example, we may tell an advertiser that X number of individuals visited a certain area on our website, or that Y number of men and Z number of women filled out our registration form, but we would not disclose anything that could be used to identify those individuals.

Finally, we never use or share the personally identifiable information provided to us online in ways unrelated to the ones described above without also providing you an opportunity to opt-out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses.

**Our Commitment To Data Security:**  
To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online.

**Our Commitment To Children’s Privacy:**  
Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important. For that reason, we never collect or maintain information at our website from those we actually know are under 13, and no part of our website is structured to attract anyone under 13.

**How You Can Access Or Correct Your Information:**  
You can access all your personally identifiable information that we collect online and maintain by Attracta™.

You can correct factual errors in your personally identifiable information by sending us a request that credibly shows error.

To protect your privacy and security, we will also take reasonable steps to verify your id entity before granting access or making corrections.
