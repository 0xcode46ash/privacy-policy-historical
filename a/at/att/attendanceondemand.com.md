### Other Information

Cookies: Attendance on Demand, or its Service Providers may send a cookie to your computer or use web beacons to gather statistical information. Neither cookies nor web beacons personally identify you. A cookie is a piece of data that a website can send to your browser, which is then stored on your computer as an anonymous tag that identifies your computer. When a visitor accesses certain pages on the Site an anonymous notice of that visit is generated which may be processed by us or by our Service Providers. Web beacons work in conjunction with cookies to let us know what portions of the Site are of interest to you and to help us provide you with tailored information from our Site. We use the information primarily to provide you with a personalized Internet experience that delivers information, resources, and services that are most relevant and helpful to you.  
If you never provide us with Personal Data, then your visits to our Site – despite us using cookies or web beacons – are anonymous. We don't know the actual person linked with the cookie or web beacon.  
If you do provide Personal Data, then we could potentially link that with your cookie, then gather the visits with web beacons and understand how you personally have acted when visiting the Site.  
Browsers can be set to accept or reject cookies or notify you when a cookie is being sent. If you turn off cookies, web beacon technology will still detect anonymous visits, but the notices they generate cannot be associated with other anonymous information or Personal Data and are disregarded.   
GPS: When you use the App, we also collect global positioning (GPS) data through your mobile devices.
