# View the Attendify Privacy Policy

We are committed to respecting and protecting the privacy rights of our users. We created this privacy policy (the “Policy”) to give you notice of how your private information will be collected, used and shared as you use our Services, including any white-label mobile Apps operated, managed and marketed by our Clients. Any capitalized term not defined in this Policy will have the meaning set forth in our [Terms of Service](https://web.archive.org/terms_of_service/).

In simplified form (greater detail is below), our Policy can be summarized as follows:

* #### This Policy applies to all users of the Services

This Policy applies to your use of the Services, whether you are Client or an End User of the Services, including in connection with one or more events (each, an “Event”). Please read this Policy carefully, as it describes how we collect, use and share your information. By accessing and interacting with the Services, you consent to this Policy.

If you are an End User, you may be asked by the Client associated with your account to provide additional information to them, including your personally identifiable information, to be used and shared pursuant to such Client’s own privacy policies. We may also collect and share information related to interactions by End Users with Clients. We encourage you to read the Client’s privacy policies. We are not responsible for, and, to the extent permitted by law, disclaim any and all liability related to, the use of your information by any Client.

* #### We collect information from and about you

**Information you provide as you use the Services.** When you register for an Attendify account, you must provide us with certain personal information about yourself, such as name and email address. You may also voluntarily choose to provide us with personal information as you use the Services, including, without limitation, by completing your profile and registering for and interacting with others in connection with one or more Events. This may include personal information about you, such as your address, phone number and company name (if you are a Client). If you correspond with us by email, we may retain the content of your email messages, your email address and our responses. We may also retain any messages you send through the Service.

**Information we collect from you passively.** We automatically collect certain information about you as you use the Services, including, without limitation, through cookies on the Attendify website and in-app tracking when you use our Apps. This may include information about your device (such as your Unique Device Identifier), your location, your Internet usage, and how you interact with the Services. This may include information about the way you use the Services, the parts of our Services you use and third party apps or websites you visit when you leave our Services.

**Information we collect from third parties.** If you are an End User, we may receive information about you from a Client, and we may collect information from your social media accounts if you choose to give us permission to access your social media accounts. We may also work with third parties who collect information about you when you use our app. For example, our vendors might use scripts or other tools to track your activities on our Services. They may do this to make sure our Services function properly.

* #### We use information about you as disclosed and described here

**We use information to administer and provide the core functionality of the Services.** For example, we use your information, such as your contact information, in connection with any Events for which you register.

**We use information to improve our products and services.** We may use your information to make our website, apps and products better. We might use your information to customize your experience with us.

**We may use information to respond to your requests or questions.** For example, we might use your information, such as your email address, to respond to your customer questions or feedback.

**We may use information to communicate with you about your account or our relationship.** We may contact you about your account or feedback. We might also contact you about this Policy or our app Terms of Service, found at [https://attendify.com/terms_of_service/](https://web.archive.org/terms_of_service/)

**We may use information for security purposes.** We may use information to protect our company, a Client, and/or our website and apps.

**We may use information for promotional purposes.** For example, we might provide you with information about new features, updates, new products or special offers from time to time. If you prefer not to receive promotional messages from us, please read the choices section below in Section 5.

* #### We may share information with third parties

**We will share information to provide the functionality of the Services.** These are third parties who perform services on our behalf. For example, we may share information with external social media services if an End User elects to cross-publish a post. We may also share information with our vendors who provide payment processing, hosting, customer support, email marketing and other services to us. If you are an End User, we will also share your information (including your contact information and information about your engagement on the Services) with the Client associated with your account in order to provide the functionality of the Services. The Client may contact you in relation to one or more Events for which you have registered (including through push notification on your device), or for other purposes. We do not control how a Client uses and shares your information, and encourage you to familiarize yourself with the Client’s privacy policy and practices.

**We may share information to comply with the law.** We will also share information if we think we have to in order to comply with the law or to protect ourselves. For example, we will share information to respond to a court order, subpoena, or a request from a government agency or investigatory body. We might also share information when we are investigating potential fraud.

**We may share information with any successor to all or part of our business.** For example, if all or a part of our business was sold, we may share information as part of that transaction.

**We may otherwise share information with your permission.**

* #### You have certain choices about sharing and marketing practices

**You can opt out of receiving our promotional emails.** To stop receiving our promotional emails, follow the instructions in any promotional message you get from us. Even if you opt out of getting marketing messages, we will still send you transactional messages. These include responses to your questions.

**You can control cookies and other browser-based tracking tools.** For example, your browser may give you the ability to control cookies or other browser-based tracking tools. Please note that if you block cookies, certain features on the Attendify website may not work.

**Our Do Not Track Policy:** Some browsers have “do not track” features that allow you to tell a website not to track you. These features are not all uniform. We do not currently respond to those signals.

**You can control tools on your mobile devices.** For example, you can turn off the GPS locator or push notifications on your phone. Please note that turning off certain tools on your mobile device may affect the functionality of certain features of the Services.

* #### Your California privacy rights

If you reside in California, you have the right to ask us one time each year if we have shared personal information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes. To make a request, please send us an email at [support@attendify.com](mailto:support@attendify.com), or write to us at the address listed at the end of this Policy. Indicate in your letter that you are a California resident making a “Shine the Light” inquiry.

* #### The Services are not intended for children

Our Services are meant for use by adults only. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13 without permission from a parent or guardian. If you are a parent or legal guardian and think your child under 13 has given us information, you can email us at [support@attendify.com](mailto:support@attendify.com).

* #### Privacy Shield – International data transfers

If you choose to use the Services from the European Union (“EU”), Switzerland or other regions of the world with laws governing data collection and use that may differ from the law of the United States of America (“US”), please note that you are transferring your personal information outside of those regions to the US for storage and processing. By providing any information, including personal information about you, on or to the Services, you consent to such transfer, storage, and processing.

We participate in, and comply with, the Privacy Shield Principles regarding the collection, use, sharing, and retention of personal information from the EU and Switzerland. If there is any conflict between the terms in this Policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern. Our participation in Privacy Shield applies to all personal data that is subject to this Policy and is received from the EU or Switzerland. We will comply with the Privacy Shield Principles in respect of such personal data.

If you have a Privacy Shield-related question or complaint, please contact us at [support@attendify.com](mailto:support@attendify.com), or write to us at the address listed at the end of this Policy.

As part of our participation in Privacy Shield, if you have a dispute with us about our adherence to the Privacy Shield Principles, we will seek to resolve it through JAMS, an independent alternative dispute resolution body based in the US. To make a claim with JAMS under the Privacy Shield Principles, please visit https://www.jamsadr.com/eu-us-privacy-shield.

In certain circumstances, you may have the right to invoke binding arbitration under Privacy Shield, as described in Annex I to the Privacy Shield Principles, which can be found at the following URL: <https://www.privacyshield.gov/article?id=ANNEX-I-introduction>.

As a Privacy Shield participant, we are subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the US Federal Trade Commission and other authorized statutory bodies. Under certain circumstances, we may be liable for the transfer of personal data that we receive and subsequently transfer to a third party, as described in the Privacy Shield Principles.

As described in this Policy, we may share information with third parties and may be required to disclose information in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.

Finally, you may contact us at [support@attendify.com](mailto:support@attendify.com), or write to us at the address listed at the end of this Policy, to request access to your personal information to be able to correct, amend, or delete that information where it is inaccurate or has been processed in violation of the Privacy Shield Principles, or to request that your personal information not be used for a purpose that is materially different from the purposes for which it was originally collected or for purposes subsequently authorized by you. You may also contact us to request that we do not disclose your personal information to third parties (other than those that are acting as our agent to perform tasks on our behalf, such as payment and data processors). However, as the core functionality of the Services require that we share your information with Clients, you will not be able to use the Services if you request that we not disclose your information to third parties.

* #### How we store your information

We keep your personal information as long as necessary to provide the functionality of the Services. As described in more detail above in section 8 (“Privacy Shield – International Data Transfers”), if you would like to access your information or would like us to delete or modify your information, you may contact us by email at [support@attendify.com](mailto:support@attendify.com), or you may write to us at the address listed at the end of this Policy. However, we may also keep your information as otherwise required by law.

To continue to provide an effective service, we may store non-personally identifiable information perpetually and may anonymize your personally identifiable information and store that anonymized information perpetually. Additionally, we use third-party services and do not control their practices related to storage and retention of your information.

* #### How we protect your information

We use reasonable efforts to secure your information and to attempt to prevent the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information that we obtain from you. However, the Internet and mobile apps are not 100% secure. We cannot promise that your use of our Services will be completely safe. We are not responsible to our users or to any third party due to any such loss, misuse, or alteration of data, except to the extent required by the Privacy Shield Principles or applicable law. We encourage you to use caution when using apps and the Internet. This includes not sharing your passwords.

* #### We may link to other sites or have third party services on our Services we don’t control

Our Services may have links to websites we do not control. Our Services may also have plugins or host other third party services that we don’t control. This Policy does not apply to the privacy practices of those websites or third parties. When you interact with those websites or third parties, they may collect information from you. Read the privacy policy of other websites carefully. We are not responsible for, and disclaim any and all liability for, these third-party practices.
