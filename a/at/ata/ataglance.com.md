# Customer Service

### Safe, Secure Checkout

We understand your concerns about online security and use Secure Socket Layer ("SSL") security technology to safeguard your shopping transactions and encrypt your payment information. When you check out, your browser will automatically be sent to our secure commerce server, encrypting all personal information before it is transmitted over the Internet. The result is a website offering the highest level of service, convenience and trustworthiness our customers have come to expect from us. 

### The Secure Order Process

Using IBM's ebusiness software, in conjunction with features built into popular browser software, our site provides advanced security for your online purchases. 

Once you start the order process by clicking the [“Checkout”](https://web.archive.org/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/OrderCalculate?URL=OrderItemDisplay&storeId=10054&catalogId=10002&orderId=&mainnav=Y&shopStoreID=10052) button on the shopping cart page or log into [“My Account”](https://web.archive.org/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/LogonForm?langId=-1&catalogId=10002&mainnav=Y&storeId=10054&shopStoreID=10052), the security features are automatic and you don’t need to do anything special to invoke them. Your browser looks for a digital certificate to confirm communication with ataglance.com. Once a positive ID is made, your order continues. Your computer and our server begin communicating in secure mode, sending data back and forth in an encrypted format. At this point you may see a pop-up window, which some browsers display when you are about to receive a secure document. It's fine to click "OK" (or "Continue") to proceed – it simply means you will begin receiving pages in a highly secure encrypted format.

After your browser has entered secure mode, we'll ask you to enter, or if you're using Quick Checkout, to confirm, your credit card information. The encryption features of browser software are exceptionally powerful and ensure the security of this data as it is transmitted to our server. Our site makes use of the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol and 128-bit strong encryption to provide the highest level of security available. 

Security measures continue even after you've placed your order, as we process your order in a highly secure computing environment.

### Security: Watching It Work

The most popular web browsers use clear visual symbols to let you know whether or not they are in secure mode. The symbols are displayed either at the bottom left or bottom right of your browser window and resemble a closed lock.

Another indication that a browser is in secure mode can be found in the website address displayed by your browser. The address will begin "http://" in standard, non-secure mode and "https://" in secure mode. The "s" stands for "secure." 

### If You Forget Your Password

In the event you forget your [“My Account”](https://web.archive.org/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/LogonForm?langId=-1&catalogId=10002&mainnav=Y&storeId=10054&shopStoreID=10052) password, we offer an online process that verifies your identity and allows you to receive a new password. When you complete this process, we take an extra measure of security and delete any credit card information saved in your ataglance.com [“My Account”](https://web.archive.org/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/LogonForm?langId=-1&catalogId=10002&mainnav=Y&storeId=10054&shopStoreID=10052). Of course, you may reenter your credit card information once you've entered a new password. (If you simply change your password after logging in, saved credit card information remains intact.) 

### Your Privacy Rights

### Information We Share with Others and Your Privacy Rights

We contract with other companies to provide certain services, including credit card processing, shipping, email distribution, market research and promotions management. We provide these companies with only the information they need to perform their services and work closely with them to ensure that your privacy is respected and protected. These companies are prohibited by contract from using this information for their own marketing purposes or from sharing this information with anyone other than ataglance.com.

From time to time, we make our mailing list (names and addresses only) and general shopping activity available to carefully screened companies whose products we believe will be of interest to you and whose privacy practices meet the Direct Marketing Association's privacy standards. If you prefer that we do not share any information with these companies, please [contact us](https://web.archive.org/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/MWContactView?langId=-1&storeId=10052&shopStoreID=10052&catalogId=10002).

On rare occasions, we may disclose specific information upon governmental request, in response to a court order, or when required by law to do so. We may also share information with companies assisting in fraud protection or investigation. We do not provide information to these agencies or companies for marketing or commercial purposes.

### Your Choices

We offer choices about the types of information you receive from us. If you prefer not to receive catalogs or other communications from ataglance.com or if you prefer to receive them less frequently, please [contact us](https://web.archive.org/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/MWContactView?langId=-1&storeId=10052&shopStoreID=10052&catalogId=10002) at the address shown at the top. If you no longer wish to receive our emails you also may [contact us](https://web.archive.org/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/MWContactView?langId=-1&storeId=10052&shopStoreID=10052&catalogId=10002) at the address above or unsubscribe using the link provided in each edition of the email.

If you do not want to receive mailings from other carefully screened companies, please [contact us](https://web.archive.org/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/MWContactView?langId=-1&storeId=10052&shopStoreID=10052&catalogId=10002) at the address above.

Please be sure to provide us your exact name and address, or the mailing label from your catalog, so that we can be sure to identify you correctly. Because mailings are planned in advance, it may take several weeks for your request to become effective. If, due to human error, you continue to receive unwanted communications, please [contact us](https://web.archive.org/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/MWContactView?langId=-1&storeId=10052&shopStoreID=10052&catalogId=10002) again and we will make every effort to correct the situation.

### Cookies and Pixel Tags

A cookie is a small data file that is stored by your web browser on your computer. Cookies enable you to place an order on our website. They also allow us to enhance and personalize your online shopping experience, so that the information you receive is more relevant to you.

> For example, we use cookies to:  
> 
> * Remember what items are in your shopping cart 
> * Recognize you when you return to our website 
> * Enable you to use Quick Checkout, if you have created an account at ataglance.com

If you set your browser to refuse cookies or experience an issue placing your order online, please call us at 800.365.9327 to place your order.

We also use pixel tags – tiny graphic images – to tell us what parts of our Web site you have visited or to measure the effectiveness of any searches you may do on our site. Pixel tags also enable us to send you email in a format you can read and let us know when you have opened an email message from us.

We also may contract with other companies who use cookies or other online tools such as pixel tags to measure the performance of a marketing effort on our behalf. We prohibit these companies from using this information for their own marketing purposes or from sharing this information with anyone other than ataglance.com.

### How We Use Email

When you provide us your email address, we may send you emails necessary to process your order or respond to a request. For example, after you place an order at ataglance.com, you will receive an email confirmation and, in most cases, an email of shipping confirmation with package tracking information. 

It is our intent to send you promotional email (promotions and special offers) only if you have agreed to receive it. Instructions on how to unsubscribe are included in each email and can be modified at anytime by logging onto [“My Account”](https://web.archive.org/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/LogonForm?langId=-1&catalogId=10002&mainnav=Y&storeId=10054&shopStoreID=10052) and changing your communication preferences.

### Links to Other Sites

Occasionally we provide links on our website to other sites we think you will enjoy. These sites may operate independently of ataglance.com and have established their own privacy and security policies. For the best online experience, we strongly encourage you to review these policies at any site you visit.

### Security

It is our intent to protect against the loss, misuse or alteration of information that we have collected from you. We use a variety of current technologies and processes for protection of our customer data. We limit the information we provide to outside companies with whom we contract to only what they need to carry out their responsibilities.

When you make a purchase, request a catalog or create an account on our website, your transactional information is transmitted in a safe, encrypted format. See About Security for details.
