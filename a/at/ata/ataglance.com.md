# MeadWestvaco : Privacy Policy

  
MeadWestvaco is committed to protecting the privacy of visitors to this site.  
When you visit our site, certain information is automatically sent to us from your browser. This includes an IP (Internet Protocol) address. We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track user’s movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information and only reveal that the IP address accessed our site. We use this IP address to examine our traffic in aggregate, but do not collect and evaluate individual information. 

**Use of Cookies**

To improve your visit to our sites, we may use "cookies" to obtain non-personal information (cookies are text information files that your browser places on your computer when you visit a Web site). We may aggregate this data to analyze the viewing habits of our site visitors, but it will not be associated with any personally identifiable data.

**USES OF PERSONAL INFORMATION**

Personally identifiable information, which is collected for registering, communicating, and transacting business on the site, includes your name, company name, address, e-mail address, phone number, and fax number. You are under no obligation to provide this information, but without it, we may not be able to provide you with the service or the information you request.

We make a good faith effort to assure that the personally identifiable information you provide us remains private. We will not sell, share, or rent this information to others outside of 

_www.meadwestvaco.com_ except that we may share such information with 3rd party vendors performing services for us, such as payroll service and benefit organizations, affirmative action compliance organizations, and travel arrangement companies. All of your information, not just the personally identifiable information, has restricted usage in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information.

**CHILDREN’S PRIVACY**

While some of our sites contain information relevant for children under the age of 13, our site is not directed at children under the age of 13, and we do not ask for, collect, or use any personal information from anyone identified as being under the age of 13. 

**ACCESS TO YOUR INFORMATION**

If your personally identifiable information changes (such as your mail code), or if a correction is to be made or if you no longer desire our service, you may contact us through our [Contact Us](https://web.archive.org/corporate.nsf/contactUs) function. If you desire that we stop the use of your data for any purpose, you should contact us by sending an e-mail to us through [Contact Us](https://web.archive.org/corporate.nsf/contactUs) to inform us of your decision and upon receipt, we will stop all use of the data identifiable to you.

**CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY**

If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on our Homepage so you are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances we disclose it. If at any point we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify you by e-mail. You will have a choice as to whether or not we use your information in this manner. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected. This site contains links to other sites. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this site and not to any other sites. 

When you use this site, you consent to the collection and use of information by www.meadwestvaco.com as specified above.
