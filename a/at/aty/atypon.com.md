# Privacy Policy - Atypon Systems, Inc.

Atypon Systems, Inc. ("Atypon") is committed to protecting the privacy and security of all individuals who use our site. This Privacy Policy is designed to help you learn more about the personal information we collect, who we might share it with, and how we protect it. Our goal is to provide the information, resources, and services that are most relevant and helpful to you. In order to achieve this goal, from time to time we may collect information during your visits.

## Information Supplied by Our Users

## Links to Other Sites

Atypon provides links to third party websites. We encourage you to review the privacy statements of websites you choose to visit from Atypon so that you can understand how those websites collect, use, and share your information. Atypon is not responsible for the privacy statements or other content on websites outside of the Atypon site.

## Use of Disclose of your Personal Information to Third Parties
