**Websites we operate  
** We currently operate the web sites www.ati.com and www.shopati.com (the (“Sites”). In addition, we own several other domain names that point to the web sites listed above. From time to time we may add new sites that may not be listed above, but will provide a link to this policy.

**Information We Collect From You  
**In order to operate the Sites and provide you with information on products and services that may be of interest to you, we may collect contact information (i.e., information that could be used to contact you, such as full name, postal address, phone number and email address, as well as your computer’s unique IP address (if any)), financial information (i.e., passwords, credit card numbers and bank and other financial institution account numbers) and demographic information (e.g., zip code, hometown, gender, purchase history information and age as well as IP addresses that are not unique to your computer) from you. Please note that nowhere on the Sites do we knowingly collect contact information or financial information from children under the age of 13.

**ATI's Use of Personal Information  
**ATI will ask for your consent when we need information that personally identifies you (personal information) or allows us to contact you. Generally, this information is requested when you are asked to register before entering a contest, ordering e-mail newsletters, joining a limited-access premium site, or when purchasing and registering ATI products. Personal information collected by ATI often is limited to e-mail address, language, country or location, but may include other information when needed to provide a service you requested. 

When you buy and install a new product, we ask you to register your purchase electronically. When you do, we keep this registration information on file (in our secure database) with any information you've already given us on previous visits to our Sites. This is considered your personal information. 

We occasionally hire other companies to provide limited services on our behalf, including packaging, mailing and delivering purchases, answering customer questions about products or services, sending postal mail and processing event registration. We will only provide those companies the information they need to deliver the service, and they are prohibited, by contract, from using that information for any other purpose. 

ATI will disclose your personal information, without notice, only if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to legal requirements or comply with legal process served on ATI or the Sites; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of ATI and its Sites, and, (c) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of the Sites, or the public.

**Control of your Personal Information**  
You may unsubscribe from emails and promotional offers by clicking the unsubscribe link at the bottom of any email sent to you by ATI, or by changing your preference on your ATI Communication Preference Center Profile. 

If your email address has changed and you would like to continue to receive the ATI.com newsletter(s), you will need update your profile with your new email address. 

ATI.com may, if you choose to receive them, send out periodic emails informing you of technical service issues, information about account issues, or news about changes or updates to the site. As long as you maintain an ATI.com account, you can choose to opt-in or opt-out of these emails.

**Security of your Personal Information  
** ATI Technologies Inc. is committed to protecting the security of your personal information. We use a variety of advanced security technologies and procedures to help protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. For example, we store the personal information you provide on secured computer servers that are located in controlled facilities.

A password is required to access your ATI.com or your ShopATI.com account. It is your responsibility to keep your password confidential. Do not share this information with anyone. If you are sharing a computer with anyone you should always choose to log out before leaving your ATI.com account to protect access to your information from subsequent users.
