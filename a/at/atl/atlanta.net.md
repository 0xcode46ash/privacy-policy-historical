# Atlanta.net - ACVB Privacy Policy

The Atlanta Convention and Visitors Bureau ("ACVB") respects the privacy and confidentiality of individuals who visit the ACVB web site located at www.atlanta.net. The ACVB maintains this Privacy Policy to help you understand the commitment of ACVB to safeguard the privacy of the information you provide to the ACVB on the ACVB Website. This Privacy Policy outlines the information which ACVB will collect from you on the ACVB Website and how ACVB will use that information. 

Collection of Your Personal Information by ACVB  
The ACVB's mission is to provide you with personalized services and offerings designed to enhance your Atlanta experience. To do so effectively, ACVB collects the following information:

(a) Personally Identifiable Information. ACVB, through the use of the ACVB Website, only collects personally identifiable information about you when you voluntarily provide such personally identifiable information to ACVB using the ACVB Website. If you do not wish your personally identifiable information to be collected, please do not submit it.

(b) Information from the Use of "Cookies". The ACVB Website employs "cookie" technology.

It is the policy of the ACVB not to sell, share, transfer, or rent to third parties any information you provide to the ACVB, through the use of the ACVB Website, without your written consent except as required by operation of the law or in compliance with legal authorities; provided, however the ACVB may share your personal information with certain third parties ("Target Third Parties") without your written consent in order to further the purpose for which you voluntarily provide the ACVB with the information. Additionally, the ACVB engages third party information management service providers to help maintain efficient operations. Because such information management service providers may access our systems, such information management service providers may have access to your information. The ACVB does not transfer or relinquish ownership of information maintained about you within ACVB systems and databases to such information management service providers but requires these information management service providers to sign confidentiality agreements to keep all confidential information and other proprietary information found in our systems confidential.

The ACVB reserves the right to take any action the ACVB deems prudent or necessary to safeguard the ACVB Website and your information in the ACVB systems and databases from malicious or unwarranted attack by viruses, hackers, or other miscreants.

Collection and Use of Your Information by Third Parties  
Please note that third parties offer goods and services on and through the ACVB Website. We assume each such third party has its own internal privacy policy and data collection and use practices. The ACVB does not have any responsibility for their practices.

You may request the ACVB change or delete your personal information in ACVB systems and databases by submitting a detailed description of the desired action to the following e-mail address:
