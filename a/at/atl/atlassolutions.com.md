# Privacy Policy

**Atlas Privacy Updates**.  Check the Atlas Privacy Policy from time to time below for the latest official policy.  We also may provide tips and other relevant information here, so come back often and check it out. 

**Choice and Control Tip.**   Atlas is now owned by Facebook.  Atlas adheres to the Network Advertising Initiative and Digital Advertising Alliance’s Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising.  For more information you can visit [networkadvertising.org](http://networkadvertising.org/) or [aboutads.info](http://aboutads.info/). 

Privacy Policy

Effective date: April 26, 2013

We provide a range of advertising services to advertisers, ad agencies, and Web site publishers.  As part of those services, we may display ads on our own sites, sites operated by businesses that are legally part of the same group of companies as Atlas (“affiliates”), the sites of our advertising partners, and also display ads in mobile apps operated by our affiliates and third parties (together, “Web sites”).  Some of the ads we display may be targeted based on your online behavior, as described below. To opt-out of targeted advertising from Atlas **,** [click here](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/). 

**THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT AND USE**

When online advertisements that utilize our technology are displayed to you, we will place one or more persistent cookies (or similar technologies, including Web beacons, as described below) on your computer or device in order to recognize your computer or device each time such ads are displayed.  The information we collect includes, but may not be limited to, your computer’s or device’s IP address, cookie IDs, unique identifiers associated with your browser or device, browser type and language, operating system, Web site URLs, app name, the specific ad posted to the site or app, and the date and time of delivery.  In addition, we may collect unique identifiers associated with the products and services that our affiliates and partners provide to you. If you click on the advertisement, we will also collect and store that action.  Because we may serve advertisements on many different Web sites, we are able to compile information over time about where you, or others who are using your device, saw and/or clicked on the advertisements we display. The cookies we use for delivering advertisements have an expiry date of no more than 2 years.

We may also place Web beacons (also called action tags or clear gifs) on Web sites and in the advertisements we deliver, and we may provide our beacons to our advertising partners to place on their own Web sites.  We may also include Web beacons in promotional e-mail messages or newsletters in order to determine whether messages have been opened and acted upon.  Our beacons allow us to place or read our cookies and gather information about your subsequent visit, purchase, or other activity in connection with our advertising partners’ Web sites.  We and our advertising partners may use this information to determine the effectiveness of the advertisements and to show you ads based on your previous interactions with the site where the beacon is placed.  We use many different factors and types of information to select which advertisements to show you or to measure or understand the effectiveness of the advertisements that you see. For example, when we partner with advertisers and publishers, we may target some of the ads we display or perform statistical analysis according to certain general interest categories or segments that we have inferred based on:

a) the pages you view and links you click when using Web sites and services belonging to our advertising partners,  
b) the search terms you enter when using Internet search services,  
c) characteristics of the contacts you most frequently interact with through communications or social networking services,  
d) demographic or interest data, including any you may have provided when creating an account with one of our partners (e.g. age, ZIP or postal code, gender),  
e) contextual information associated with your activities on partner Web sites;  
f) a general geographic location derived from your IP address, and/or   
g) demographic or interest data acquired from partners and other companies (such as the population or other characteristics of the area where you live).

However, we designed our systems to select ads and to perform measurements based only on data that does not personally and directly identify you.  For example, we store page views, clicks and search terms used for ad targeting separately from contact information you may have provided or other data that directly identifies you (such as your name, e-mail address, etc.).  Further, our processes are designed to prevent the unauthorized correlation of this data. 

**SHARING INFORMATION WITH OTHER COMPANIES**

In some cases, we may share with advertisers and their service providers and partners the information we have collected on their sites or in connection with their advertisements.  We may also share certain aggregated information, such as the number of users that we have assigned to general interest categories or segments. We may also share non-personally identifiable information (such as cookie identifiers) directly with service providers in order to permit them to provide services on our behalf or to partner with us in selecting and serving ads for our advertising partners. 

**INFORMATION COLLECTED BY OTHER COMPANIES**

Advertisers may sometimes include their own Web beacons or other similar technologies (or those of their other advertising partners) within their display advertisements, in order to set and read their own cookies.  If you visit a Web site that uses Atlas services or click through an ad to the Web site of one of our advertising partners, those other companies may be collecting additional information about your visit.  These companies may also allow other companies (such as other ad networks or Web analytics services) to collect information on their sites through mechanisms such as Web beacons.

Atlas does not control the data collection and use practices of these other companies. You should read the privacy notices of the sites you visit in order to determine what companies may be collecting information on those sites. 

**YOUR CHOICES**

You may opt-out of targeted ads from Atlas and other advertising companies by visiting the [Network Advertising Initiative](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/) (NAI) **** or [Digital Advertising Alliance](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/) (DAA) Consumer Choice Page, which provides simple ways to opt-out of ad targeting from participating companies. When you opt-out, your selection will be stored in a cookie that is specific to your computer and the Web browser you are using. The opt-out cookie has an expiration date of 5 years. If you delete the cookies on your computer, you will need to opt-out again. 

Note:  Even if you choose not to receive personalized advertising, Atlas will continue to collect the same information as you browse the Web and click on advertisements that we deliver.  However, this information and any information collected from you in the past won’t be used for displaying personalized ads. 

While most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, you can modify your browser setting to decline cookies.  Declining cookies can prevent cookie-based ad targeting but may also disable any advertising preferences that are dependent on cookies.  Similarly, most Web browsers allow you to delete cookies, but if you choose to delete cookies, any settings and preferences controlled by those cookies, including advertising preferences, will be deleted and may need to be recreated. 

**CHANGE OF CONTROL**

If we sell or otherwise transfer part or the whole of Atlas or our assets to another organization (e.g., in the course of a transaction like a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy, dissolution, liquidation), any information that we have received about you may be among the items sold or transferred.  The buyer or transferee will be required to honor the material commitments we have made in this Privacy Policy.

**Responding to legal requests and preventing harm** **:**

We may access, preserve and share your information in response to a legal request (like a search warrant, court order, or subpoena) if we have a good faith belief that the law requires us to do so. This may include responding to legal requests from jurisdictions outside of the United States where we have a good faith belief that the response is required by law in that jurisdiction, affects users in that jurisdiction, and is consistent with internationally recognized standards.  We may also access, preserve and share information when we have a good faith belief it is necessary:  to detect, prevent and address fraud and other illegal activity; to protect ourselves, you and others, including as part of investigations; and to prevent death or imminent bodily harm.  Information we receive about you may be accessed, processed and retained for an extended period of time when it is the subject of a legal request or obligation, governmental investigation, or investigations concerning possible violations of our terms or policies, or otherwise to prevent harm.

**HOW WE STORE YOUR INFORMATION**

The information that we receive through the provision of our advertising products and services may be stored and processed in the United States or any other country in which we, our affiliates, or our service providers maintain facilities.

We, our affiliates, and our service providers, may transfer information that we collect about you, including personal information across borders and from your country or jurisdiction to other countries or jurisdictions around the world.  If you are located in the European Union or other regions with laws governing data collection and use that may differ from U.S. law, please note that we may transfer information, including personal information, to a country and jurisdiction that does not have the same data protection laws as your jurisdiction.

We use commercially reasonable safeguards to help keep secure the information we receive.  However, Atlas cannot ensure the security of any information that we receive from or about you or guarantee that information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed.

**CHILDREN'S PRIVACY**

Atlas does not knowingly collect or solicit any information from anyone under the age of 13.  Atlas’s services are not directed at children under the age of 13.  In the event that we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under age 13 without parental consent, we will delete that information.  If you believe that we might have any information from or about a child under 13, please contact us at [atlasprivacy@fb.com](mailto:atlasprivacy@fb.com).

**OTHER WEB SITES AND SERVICES**

We are not responsible for the practices employed by any Web sites or services where our services are used.  Please remember that when you visit another Web site or service or use an app, our Privacy Policy does not apply to those third-party Web sites or services. Your browsing and interaction on any third-party Web site or service, including those that have used our advertising services, are subject to that third party's own rules and policies.
