# Privacy Policy | Atlas Solutions

**Choice and Control Tip.** Atlas is owned by Facebook. Atlas adheres to the Network Advertising Initiative’s Code of Conduct and Digital Advertising Alliance’s Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising. For more information you can visit [networkadvertising.org](http://networkadvertising.org/) or [aboutads.info](http://aboutads.info/).

**Privacy Policy**

Effective date: February 6, 2014

We provide a range of advertising services to advertisers, ad agencies, app developers, and website publishers. As part of those services, we may display ads on our own sites, sites operated by businesses that are legally part of the same group of companies as Atlas (“affiliates”), the sites of our advertising partners (together, “websites”), and also in mobile apps operated by our affiliates and third parties. Some of the ads we display are targeted based on your online behavior, as described below. See the “Your Choices” section for instructions on how you can opt out of having Atlas use your information to deliver targeted advertisements to your browser or mobile device.

**THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT AND USE**

When online advertisements that use our technology are displayed to you, we place one or more persistent cookies (or similar technologies, including web beacons, as described below) on your computer or device to recognize your computer or device each time such ads are displayed. The information we collect includes, but may not be limited to, your computer’s or device’s IP address, cookie IDs, unique identifiers associated with your browser or device, browser type and language, operating system, website URLs, app name, the specific ad posted to the site or app, and the date and time of delivery. In addition, we collect unique identifiers associated with the products and services that our affiliates and partners provide to you. If you click on the advertisement, we will also collect and store that action. [Click here](http://atlassolutions.com/cookie-policy/) to learn more about how we use cookies and other similar technologies.

Because we may serve advertisements on many different websites, we are able to compile information over time about where you, or others who are using your device(s), saw and/or clicked on the advertisements we display. Atlas retains the data it receives from your interactions with our client’s websites, apps and advertisements that we use to serve ads targeted to your interests for 13 months, at which point the information is aggregated with data collected from other devices and individuals.

We also place web beacons (also called action tags or clear gifs) or code on websites and in the advertisements we deliver, and we provide our beacons and code to our advertising partners to place on their own websites. We also include web beacons in promotional e-mail messages or newsletters to determine whether messages have been opened and acted upon. Our beacons and code allow us to place or read our cookies, as well as unique identifier stored on mobile devices, and gather information about your subsequent visit, purchase, or other activity in connection with our advertising partners’ websites. We and our advertising partners use this information to determine the effectiveness of the advertisements that you see and to show you ads based on your previous interactions with the website where the beacon or code is placed. We use different factors and types of information to select which advertisements to show you or to measure or understand the effectiveness of the advertisements that you see. For example, when we partner with advertisers and publishers, we sometimes target ads or perform statistical analysis according to certain general interest categories or demographic segments that we have inferred based on:

a) the pages you view and links you click when using websites and services belonging to our advertising partners,  
b) the search terms you enter when using internet search services,  
c) characteristics of the contacts you most frequently interact with through communications or social networking services,  
d) demographic or interest data, including any you may have provided when creating an account with one of our affiliates or partners (e.g. age, ZIP or postal code, gender),  
e) contextual information associated with your activities on partner websites;  
f) a general geographic location derived from your IP address, and/or  
g) demographic or interest data acquired from partners and other companies (such as the population or other characteristics of the area where you live).

We comply with the NAI Code of Conduct and have implemented administrative and technical processes that are designed to prevent the unauthorized merging of page views, clicks and search terms with personally identifying information (such as your name, e-mail address, etc.) to target ads to you without your permission.

**SHARING INFORMATION WITH OTHER COMPANIES**

In some cases, we share with advertisers and their service providers and partners the information we have collected on their websites or in connection with their advertisements. We may also share certain aggregated information, such as the number of users that we have assigned to general interest categories or segments. We share non-personally identifiable information (such as cookie identifiers) directly with service providers to permit them to provide services on our behalf or to partner with us in selecting and serving ads for our advertising partners.

We share non-personally identifiable information (such as cookie identifiers) directly with service providers to permit them to provide services on our behalf or to partner with us in selecting and serving ads for our advertising partners.

We also may share information we receive with affiliates, such as our parent company Facebook, and our affiliates may share information with us as well. We and our affiliates use shared information to help provide, understand, and improve our services and their own services.

**INFORMATION COLLECTED BY OTHER COMPANIES**

Advertisers sometimes include their own web beacons or other similar technologies (or those of their other advertising partners) within their display advertisement, to set and read their own cookies. If you visit a website that uses Atlas services or click through an ad to the website of one of our advertising partners, those other companies may be collecting additional information about your visit. These companies may also allow other companies (such as other ad networks or web analytics services) to collect information on their sites through mechanisms such as Web beacons. Third parties also could use these technologies to collect information about how you use our Services and other sites.

Atlas does not control the data collection and use practices of these other companies. You should read the privacy notices of the sites you visit to determine what companies may be collecting information on those sites.

**YOUR CHOICES**

You may opt-out of targeted ads from Atlas and other advertising companies by visiting the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) or Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) Consumer Choice Page, which provide simple ways to opt-out of ad targeting from participating companies. When you opt-out, your selection will be stored in a cookie that is specific to your computer and the web browser you are using. The opt-out cookie has an expiration date of five years. If you delete the cookies on your computer, you will need to opt-out again.

Your mobile device may offer a preference concerning the receipt of targeted ads from Atlas that are displayed inside mobile apps. To learn more, please visit your mobile device’s settings menu.

Note: Even if you choose not to receive personalized advertising, Atlas will continue to collect the same information when you browse the Web, see or click on an advertisement that we deliver or measure, or use one of our advertisers’ apps. However, this information and any information collected from you in the past from that browser or device won’t be used for displaying personalized ads.

While most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, you can modify your browser setting to decline cookies. Declining cookies can prevent cookie-based ad targeting but may also disable any advertising preferences that are dependent on cookies. Similarly, most Web browsers allow you to delete cookies, but if you choose to delete cookies, any settings and preferences controlled by those cookies, including advertising preferences, will be deleted and may need to be recreated.

**CHANGE OF CONTROL**

If we sell or otherwise transfer part or the whole of Atlas or our assets to another organization (e.g., in the course of a transaction like a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy, dissolution, liquidation), any information that we have received about you may be among the items sold or transferred. The buyer or transferee will be required to honor the material commitments we have made in this Privacy Policy.

Responding to legal requests and preventing harm:

We may access, preserve and share your information in response to a legal request (like a search warrant, court order, or subpoena) if we have a good faith belief that the law requires us to do so. This may include responding to legal requests from jurisdictions outside of the United States where we have a good faith belief that the response is required by law in that jurisdiction, affects users in that jurisdiction, and is consistent with internationally recognized standards. We may also access, preserve and share information when we have a good faith belief it is necessary: to detect, prevent and address fraud and other illegal activity; to protect ourselves, you and others, including as part of investigations; and to prevent death or imminent bodily harm. Information we receive about you may be accessed, processed and retained for an extended period of time when it is the subject of a legal request or obligation, governmental investigation, or investigations concerning possible violations of our terms or policies, or otherwise to prevent harm.

**HOW WE STORE YOUR INFORMATION**

The information that we receive through the provision of our advertising products and services may be stored and processed in the United States or any other country in which we, our affiliates, or our service providers maintain facilities.

We, our affiliates, and our service providers, may transfer information that we collect about you, including personal information across borders and from your country or jurisdiction to other countries or jurisdictions around the world. If you are located in the European Union or other regions with laws governing data collection and use that may differ from U.S. law, please note that we may transfer information, including personal information, to a country and jurisdiction that does not have the same data protection laws as your jurisdiction.

We use commercially reasonable safeguards to help keep secure the information we receive. However, Atlas cannot ensure the security of any information that we receive from or about you or guarantee that information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed.

**CHILDREN’S PRIVACY**

Atlas does not knowingly collect or solicit any information from anyone younger than 13 years of age. Atlas’s services are not directed at children younger than 13. In the event that we learn that we have collected personal information from a child younger than 13 without parental consent, we will delete that information. If you believe that we might have any information from or about a child younger than 13, please contact us at atlasprivacy@fb.com.

**OTHER WEB SITES AND SERVICES**

We are not responsible for the practices employed by any websites or services where our services are used. Please remember that when you visit another website or service or use an app, our Privacy Policy does not apply to those third-party websites or services. Your browsing and interaction on any third-party website or service, including those that have used our advertising services, are subject to that third party’s own rules and policies.
