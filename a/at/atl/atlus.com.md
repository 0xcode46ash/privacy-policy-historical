_**There are links to other websites within ATLUS's websites. Does ATLUS's Online Privacy Policy apply to those sites? **_

_**A Message to All Parents **_  
ATLUS takes privacy very seriously for all visitors, but particularly for our younger visitors. 

Please note that if a child states that he or she is under 13 years old, we do not collect or store any contact information for them. This is in compliance with current Federal Trade Commission regulations. Children under 13 are allowed to participate in certain ATLUS promotions (each promotion's rules will clearly state when participation is restricted by age and to what age) and provide contact information should they win. However, we delete this information once the contest is over. We do not collect any information that is not necessary to operate our site and we do not sell the data we collect to outside parties. 

If your child registers to receive the ATLUS Faithful e-mail newsletter, he or she will be asked to input his or her age, and to choose one of two newsletter options: 1) for those who are under 17 years of age or refuse to reveal their age (cannot receive information about ESRB Mature-rated games); and 2) for those who are 17 years of age or older. If you do not wish for your child to receive ATLUS Faithful e-mail newsletters, you may Unsubscribe them at any time simply by clicking the Unsubscribe link included in every e-mail. 

Please supervise the time that your child spends online to ensure their safety and security. 

_**Notice to parents regarding third-party websites **_  
ATLUS's websites may contain links to third-party websites, such as game retailer and game-related media websites. Please be aware that ATLUS is not responsible for the content of such websites, nor does our Online Privacy Policy cover those websites. For your peace of mind and your children's safety, please supervise your children when they are browsing the web, and always read the privacy policy of any third-party website. 

_**How can I review information that my child has submitted on ATLUS's websites? **_  
You may review or request to have deleted any information your child has submitted to us. You may also request that we not collect any personal information about your child in the future. To do this, send a written request including your child's e-mail address for verification to Atlus U.S.A., Inc., 6400 Oak Canyon, Suite 100, Irvine, CA 92618. Please mark your envelope, "ATTN: Children's Online Privacy." 

_**What if I have a question or complaint? **_  
Feel free to write us at Atlus U.S.A., Inc., 6400 Oak Canyon, Suite 100, Irvine, CA 92618. Mark envelopes, "ATTN: Privacy Department."
