Dear Publisher, 

The announcement regarding the merger of Adsmart and Flycast with Engage has made many headlines over the past few months. Engage Media is leading the industry into the "Next Generation" in Internet-based online marketing and advertising. With this in mind, we would like to provide you with a brief overview of our latest product offering, Engage AudienceNet as well as reinforce Engage's commitment to preserving consumer privacy. 

Engage AudienceNet is the first profile driven online advertising network. Its innovative new approach to online advertising allows media buyers to precisely define and purchase online media based on specific target audiences they wish to reach. Using anonymous profiles in Engage Knowledge(tm), AudienceNet matches the observed interests of visitors from our member sites and networks with advertisers' campaigns. The result is that your available ad space becomes more valuable to advertisers -- which means more revenue and better inventory utilization for your site. 

Online Privacy has seen an enormous amount of media and consumer attention in the past few months. Consumers are demanding appropriate disclosures of privacy practices before they will patronize an online business. Equally important, many advertisers are requiring privacy policies to be posted before they will have their ads served on a site. 

Engage: a pioneer 

Engage is, and has been, a pioneer and an industry leader in privacy practices and is committed to leading the industry to define best practices in this area. We consider the protection of individual privacy to be required for ethical commerce and interaction on the Internet. We encourage you to review our Privacy Statement at: [www.engage.com/privacy](http://www.engage.com/privacy). 

In order to participate in this exciting new offering from Engage, you must add language to your privacy policy that describes Engage and profiling. 

We have endeavored to make this as simple and succinct as possible - while still maintaining enough information for consumers to adequately grasp what is going on. Here's the language that needs to be added: 

This site uses the services of Engage for the serving and/or targeting of ads, promotions and other marketing messages. To do this, Engage collects anonymous data typically through the use of cookies. To learn more about Engage, including your ability to opt out of the Engage system, go to [www.engage.com/privacy](http://www.engage.com/privacy).
