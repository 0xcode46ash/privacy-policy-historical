ATB Financial's Privacy Notice 

**ATB Financial and its subsidiaries,* which operate as ATB Investor Services, are committed to protecting your personal information.**

What is Personal Information?

Personal information is defined in the Personal Information Protection Act, and means information about you, as an identifiable individual. However, personal information does not include business contact information about you, such as your business address, title, email or fax number.

Use of Your Information

From time to time, ATB may collect personal information about you, from you or from any other source, for the following purposes:

  * to understand your needs in connection with ATB’s offering of products and services;
  * to assess your eligibility for ATB’s products and services;
  * to promote and to market additional products and services ATB believes you and your family may be interested in;
  * to ensure information about you is distinguishable from that of other customers;
  * to comply with legal and regulatory requirements, including income tax reporting.



By providing your personal information to ATB, you consent to the collection, use and disclosure of that information. You may refuse to allow ATB to obtain or share your personal information, but if you make this choice, ATB may not be able to provide you with the product, services or information you requested.

Third Parties

ATB may collect your personal information from any third party, including any credit reporting agency, personal information agent, insurance company, other credit grantor, and your current or former employer or any other person, corporation, organization, society or other entity.

In order to administer the delivery of our products and services to you, ATB may provide your personal information to other entities, including credit reporting agencies, data storage providers, and other financial institutions, provided they comply with the Personal Information Protection Act or other similar legislation, or where ATB is required or permitted to do so by law.

Security and Retention

ATB will ensure the physical, organizational and electronic security of your personal information. ATB will retain your personal information only for the time it is required for the purposes outlined in this Privacy Notice.

Right to Access Your Information

You have the right to access any personal information ATB has about you, and to correct any inaccurate or incomplete information. Should you wish to obtain a copy of any contents of your file, contact the Customer Contact Centre at the number noted below.

ATB will inform you in advance if any minimal charge is required for conducting the search. 

ATB may not provide the information if it contains references to other persons, or is subject to legal privilege, or contains information confidential to ATB, or has already been destroyed due to legal requirements or because it is no longer needed for the purposes set out above.

Accuracy

ATB is committed to keeping your personal information accurate. You can help keep ATB up-to-date through prompt notification of changes to your telephone number, address, or other personal information.

Withdrawing Your Consent

On occasion, ATB may contact you to advise of products and services it believes you may be interested in, or to question you about your experience with us. These offers and surveys are based on the information you provided to us when you asked about our products or services, and are developed under strict conditions designed to safeguard the privacy of your personal information. You may request ATB not to contact you in this fashion, by calling the Customer Contact Centre at the number below. ATB may monitor and/or record your telephone calls to the Customer Contact Centre, to ensure accuracy and quality of customer service.

Consequences of Withdrawing Your Consent

If you withdraw your consent, our ability to communicate with you will be diminished. For example, we will not be able to provide you with information about our new products or services, or promotional rates on deposit and lending products.

Upon request, ATB will explain your options of withdrawing consent to the collection, use and release of your personal information. If you have any concerns or would like more information, you can contact the Privacy Manager through the Customer Contact Centre at:
