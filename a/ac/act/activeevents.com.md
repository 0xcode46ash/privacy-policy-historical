All of these services are expressly provided to the users and data processed on behalf of our clients.

In general, you can visit our Web site without identifying yourself or revealing any personally identifiable information. There are times, however, that you may choose to give us personally identifiable information, such as your name, address, phone number, e-mail address and other information about yourself. For example, if you would like to receive information about Active, our products, or to schedule a demo of one of our products, you will need to provide us with your name, address, phone, email and fax number.

We allow users to provide us with testimonials. In all cases where personal information is posted to any site, we receive permission to post such information.

We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personally identifiable information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however.
