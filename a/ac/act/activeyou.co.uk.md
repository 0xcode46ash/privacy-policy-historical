You do not need to register to browse the Site, but if you want to enter into any competition or to participate in any branded survey appearing on the Site, you will need to join the ActiveYou Scheme. Joining the ActiveYou Scheme means your details will be shared not only with the organisation who provides the competition prize or sponsors the survey in question, but with other organisations who we select, (sometimes based on interests you have shown when browsing the Site, or participating in competitions and surveys on the Site) from our trusted community of data partners ('Participating Data Partners'), for them to contact you about their products, services, promotions, offers and competitions, and/or to update their records for fraud prevention, debt tracing and anti-money laundering purposes. **Section 1** of this Privacy Policy explains this in more detail and what you need to do if you do not want to receive such information - it is important that you read this before you submit your details to join the ActiveYou Scheme. **Section 2** of this Privacy Policy sets out how we will use your Personal Information regardless of whether you join the ActiveYou Scheme ie when you are generally browsing and using the Site.

We very regularly review and update the Data Categories List (usually weekly) to ensure you continue to hear about the latest great information, offers, competitions and surveys, and so to stay up to date with the types of organisation you might hear from and the types of goods and services you might hear about, please regularly refer to this list. If we learn of great competitions and offers which are not related to the current range of topics in the Data Categories List, then we will check that you are interested in these before putting you in touch with the relevant Participating Data Partner(s). 

**Participating Data Partners:**

The level of personal information we share with Participating Data Partners and how, depends on which activities you chose to participate in on the Site.
