## Security Measures

For credit card transactions, Insight adds security by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology, with 128 bit encryption. This means that the credit card information you send is encrypted by your computer, and then decrypted again on our side, preventing others from accessing your private information in between. So, when using an SSL capable browser, shopping on Insight's web site is the safest kind of transaction possible with a credit card.
