# Privacy - Actively Learn

Actively Learn Inc. “Actively Learn“ developed this Privacy Policy in order for you to understand how we collect, store, use, communicate and disclose your information.

###  **Introduction**

We collect the bare minimum of personally identifiable information necessary (first name, last name, username, and class) for students to establish an account on Actively Learn and be identified by their teacher and associated with the work they do in our application. Students' personally identifiable information is stored securely on our servers and protected with numerous technological and procedural safeguards. We do not sell or lease student personal information to third parties for their advertising, marketing, or other purposes.

### Collection and Use of Information

 **Personally Identifiable Information**

Personally identifiable information ( **PII** ) is data that personally identifies you, such as your name, mailing address, email address or credit card information. We may collect personal information from you for a variety of reasons such as processing your order for the purchase of a product or service, registering your product, enabling the use of certain features of a product, supporting a solution, downloading a software update, communication for marketing purposes from Actively Learn, creating an Actively Learn ID, or managing a job application. The PII we collect is different for teachers and staff, students under 18, and children under 13. For example, we collect first and last name, email, and school name and address for each teacher or staff member. Billing address and payment details are collected and passed to our payment processor but are not stored by Actively Learn. For students under 18, we collect first and last name and school name for each student, and the email address if school policy or technical infrastructure requires students to create accounts on Actively Learn using their email address (e.g., Google Classroom schools)

We may use PII for internal purposes such as data analysis and research to improve our products, services and content. We may also use PII to send you important notices regarding product purchases or changes to our terms and conditions or policies, and to occasionally contact teachers and staff to answer questions, resolve issues they or their students may encounter while using our product, and to inform them of new features on our platform. If you provide personal information of a third party, we will assume that you have the third party’s permission to provide such information.

As described in the next section, Actively Learn uses administrative, technological and physical safeguards to protect personal information against loss or theft, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use or modification.

 **How We Keep Your Personally Identifying Information Secure**

The security of PII is a top priority for Actively Learn. Actively Learn has protections in place to ensure our user's data is secure, and we routinely review and update these protections. We have administrative, technical, and physical safeguards in place designed to protect against unauthorized use and disclosure of or access to personal information. Specifically:

  * Amazon's AWS cloud infrastructure has been designed and is managed in [compliance with regulations, standards, and best-practices](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/), including HIPPA, SOC 1/SSAE 16/ISAE 3402 (formerly SAS70), SOC 2, SOC 3, PCI DSS Level 1, ISO 27001, FedRAMP, DIACAP and FISMA, ITAR, FIPS 140-2, CSA, and MPAA.

  * The Amazon AWS region where Actively Learn stores it's servers and database is [FedRAMP compliant](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/fedramp/).

  * Actively Learn encrypts all data in transit between the Actively Learn web application and Actively Learn's servers using TLS/SSL.

  * Actively Learn's engineering team use 2-factor authentication to access and manage ALL parts of our service and infrastructure to prevent unauthorized access even in the unlikely event one of our engineer’s passwords is compromised.

  * All Actively Learn team members use 2-factor authentication whenever possible to access other 3rd party services we use in the course of business for the same reason.




 **Non-Personally Identifying Information**

We also collect non-personally identifying information (non-PII), which is data in a form that does not allow for direct identification with any specific individual. Such non-PII may be collected through use of Actively Learn software and through cookies, web logs, web beacons and other similar applications. Any questions, notes, comments, feedback or other material created by you in Actively Learn software (but which does not identify you personally) also fall within this definition of non-PII.

We may collect, use, transfer, and disclose non-PII for any purpose, including, without limitation, better understanding customer behavior and improving the performance, features, sophistication and effectiveness of our products, software, services or websites.

 **Discussions, Notes, Feedback, and Responses**

 **Disclosure to Third Parties**

We will not sell or lease any teacher's or student's personal information with third parties for their advertising, marketing, or other purposes unless we have the teacher's or the student's parent's express permission to do so. We will not sell, lease, or share PII of students under 18 or children under 13 to third parties for any purpose, except (1) To comply with laws or a legal process such as responding to a subpoena or court order; (2) To exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims. We may share personal information with a teacher’s or student’s current or prior educational institution for authorized educational/school purposes.
