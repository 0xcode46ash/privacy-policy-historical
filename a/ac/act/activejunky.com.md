First off, WE WILL NEVER SELL OR GIVE OUT YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS!  By giving us your e-mail address, the only thing you will get from us is a kick ass newsletter once a week.  We hate junk mail and we will never give or sell your e-mail address to marketing companies or anyone else for that matter.  Trust.

Also, any other personal information that is given to us is considered confidential and will never be given out or sold.

You may unsubscribe from our newsletter at any time.  By simply clicking on the “unsubscribe” link at the bottom of a newsletter or the bottom of our website, and you will be taken out of the system.  As we would be sad to see you go, we don’t need any haters amongst us! ****
