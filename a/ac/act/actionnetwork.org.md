Privacy Policy

As a non-profit advocacy and research organization, Environmental Defense puts high priority on protecting your privacy. This privacy policy applies to this website, the [Hogwatch](http://www.hogwatch.org/) website and the [Environmental Defense Action Network](http://www.actionnetwork.org/) website. Action Network sites operated by other organizations; (see below) are governed by their own privacy policies. Another Environmental Defense site, [Scorecard](http://www.scorecard.org/), is governed by its own [privacy policy](http://www.scorecard.org/about/privacy.html).

When you register for special services on one of our sites (to get personalized content or free subscriptions, use our Action Network, enter contests, etc.), you give us personal information about yourself (such as name, address, zip code, email address, etc.). We may use this for specific, limited purposes. You can always "opt out", now or at any time later, to keep from getting any unwanted messages or solicitations.

If you have any questions, don't hesitate to contact our [Privacy Manager](mailto:wmoon@environmentaldefense.org) directly at any time.

**What Personally Identifiable Information of Yours is Collected**

This means information that tells us something about who you are, such as your name, phone number, email address, mailing address, or even credit card number (if you use a credit card to make a donation). 

If you visit our sites to read or download information, such as consumer brochures or press releases, we collect and store only the following information about you: the name of the domain from which you access the Internet (for example, aol.com, if you are connecting from an America Online account, or princeton.edu if you are connecting from Princeton University's domain); the date and time you access our site; and the Internet address of the website from which you linked directly to our site.

If you ask for one of our many personalized or enhanced services, we will ask you to provide us with personally identifiable information. On our Scorecard website, it might be your zip code, so we can guide you to information about your local neighborhood. In other cases you might be asked for your name, address, etc. as part of registering to use Action Network, to become a member, or to use other services **.** We want to be very clear: we will not obtain this kind of personally-identifying information about you when you visit our site, unless you choose to provide it to us. See How Your Information May Be Used.

**Action Network** sites operated by other organizations are governed by their own privacy policies. Each Action Network site operates independently, and no information is shared between them. Select an organization from the menu below.

**With Whom Your Information May Be Shared**

Outside of our own organization, we disclose personally identifiable information to carefully selected and screened third party non-profit and/or for-profit organizations. As a result, you may receive solicitations for donations and marketing materials for products. **** You can easily opt out to avoid getting any such solicitations from others. See How Your Information May Be Used.

[top]

**How Your Information May Be Used**

We use your personal information to be able to give you personalized service (for example, information about your neighborhood, or your favorite subjects); to send you email alerts; to answer your requests; to let you become a member online; etc. You can easily opt out at any time, to stop any further contact from us. 

We also use it to track your and others' use of our websites. This lets us see which of our features are the most popular so we can better serve our users' needs. It also lets us provide aggregate data about our traffic (not identifying you personally, but showing how many visitors used which features, for example) to outside parties. See How "Cookies" Are Used.

We may also use this information to suggest other website services to you, ask you to become a member of Environmental Defense, or to solicit donations. At any time you can opt out, so that we will not contact you by email, mail, fax, or telephone.

Finally, we may disclose personally identifiable information about you to carefully selected and screened third party non-profit or for-profit organizations. As a result, you may receive solicitations for donations and marketing materials for products. Again, you may opt out, so that no personal information about you is disclosed to any third party and no third party contacts you on the basis of information you have given to us. 

[top]

**What Choices Are Available to You Regarding Collection, Use, and Distribution of Your Information**

Now, or at any time in the future, you can correct or update information about you; and you can tell us not to send you any messages or solicitations at all; or you can accept messages from us but tell us not to allow any third party to send you messages or solicitations.

[top]

**A Note to Children under 13**

You should get permission from your parents before sending any information about yourself (such as your name, email address, and phone number) over the Internet to us, or to anyone else.

[top]

**A Note to Parents**

Our websites have sections directed to children under 13, and we recognize the special privacy protection they need. From time to time, in connection with children's artwork, poetry contests, games, or other children's content, we ask children for the following types of personal information: name, age, state, school name. We ask for the minimum amount of information we need for children to participate. This information is never made available to third parties. You can always find out what information was provided by your child, and can change or remove it by contacting our [Privacy Manager](mailto:wmoon@environmentaldefense.org).

[top]

**What Kind of Security Procedures Are In Place to Protect Against the Loss, Misuse, or Alteration of Your Information**

We store your personally identifiable information on secure servers. We also use other "anti-hacking" security measures and employ security consultants. We accept credit card donations only via a secure server. 

[top]

**How You Can Access, Update, or Delete Your Information**

For now, please contact our [Privacy Manager](mailto:wmoon@environmentaldefense.org) to obtain, change, update or delete our records of your personal information, or to change your privacy options. We plan to automate those features soon.

[top]

**How "Cookies" Are Used**

Some of our websites use "cookie" messages to automatically help provide better services. They remind us who you are and how you like to use our website, based on what you've done and told us before. The "cookie" is placed in your computer and is read when you come back to our website. Cookies let us take you to the information and features you're particularly interested in. They also let us track your and others' usage, so we know which parts of our sites are most popular. You can reject cookies or very easily cancel them later. 

We have agreed to a new proposed system of collecting user information on a strictly voluntary basis. The Open Profiling Standard (OPS) would allow computer users to create their own profiles, including their names, e-mail addresses, hobbies and interests, and any other information that they wish websites to have. For more information, go to [http://www.cookiecentral.com](http://www.cookiecentral.com/).

If you would like your browser to reject cookies, you can instruct your browser to do so.

**Changes in Our Privacy Policy**

Should our practices change, this notice will be immediately updated. Regardless of later updates, we will never use the information you submit under this current notice in a new way (in a way not described in this notice) without first providing you an opportunity to opt-out or otherwise prevent that use. See Official Terms and Conditions of using our websites.

**How to Change Your Cookie Preferences**

In **Netscape** , select "edit" from top menu bar, and choose "preferences". A dialog box will open revealing a menu of "categories". Choose "advanced" and on the bottom right, there are three cookie options. You can choose among "Accept all cookies," "Accept only cookies that are sent back to the generating server" or "Disable cookies." 

Below these choices you may also choose "Warn me before accepting a cookie," which will instruct your computer to alert you when a website is trying to place a cookie, which you can either accept or cancel.

In **Internet Explorer** , select "tools" from top menu bar and choose "internet options". Click on the "security" tab at the top of the dialog box. Click "custom level" button. A new box opens called "security settings." Scroll down to the cookies section. There are two options. "Allow cookies that are stored on your computer" gives three choices about cookies that will remain on your computer unless you delete them. "Disable" will instruct websites to not place a cookie onto your computer. "Enable" will allow cookies to be stored on your computer. "Prompt" will ask you each time whether you would like to accept a cookie from a particular site.

"Allow per-session cookies" will give you the same three options, but the computer will only save a cookie while your browser window is open during your time online. These cookies will not be permanently stored on your computer.

Choose which option you would like to implement and hit the "okay" button. The Securities option dialog box will close. Hit the "okay" button in the Internet options dialog box, and your cookie preferences will be set until you change them again.
