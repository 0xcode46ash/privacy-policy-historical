**CERTAIN EXCEPTIONAL DISCLOSURES  
**We may disclose user information in exceptional situations. For example, disclosure may occur if we consider it necessary to protect our legal rights or if the information relates to actual or threatened harmful conduct. Disclosure may be required by law or if we receive legal process, such as a search warrant, subpoena or court order.

**WHAT ARE COOKIES? WHY DO WE USE THEM?  
**Cookies are small data files stored by your browser in your computer when you visit our Site. We use cookies to make our Site easier to use and to improve Site performance. Cookies permit us to recognize users and avoid burdensome and repetitive requests for identical information. We mostly use "session cookies" that are automatically deleted after each visit. Cookies stored by our Site cannot be read by other sites. Most browsers automatically accept cookies. You can change your browser settings to refuse cookies, if you like.

**HOW DO WE PROTECT USER INFORMATION?  
**We generally do not use secure pages to collect information and we generally do not store data in encrypted form. While we do implement other practices to help protect the confidentiality, security and integrity of information stored on our system, our Site is not completely secure. Please keep this in mind as you use our Site.

**HOW LONG DO WE RETAIN USER DATA?  
**Generally, we retain user data on our server or in our archives for as long as we reasonably need it. We may alter this practice according to legal and business requirements. For example, we may shorten the retention period for certain data if needed to free up storage space. We may lengthen the retention period for other data if needed to comply with privacy standards or applicable law.

Data management requests are administered in an orderly manner to the extent feasible and within our direct control. Note: we have greater control over recently collected data than for archived data. Once data is removed from the system and archived, it may not be feasible to accommodate specific requests. In those cases, our general data retention policy applies.
