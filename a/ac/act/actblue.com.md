# ActBlue - Privacy Policy

This privacy policy describes how we use your personal information. 

  * E-mail addresses  
We request your e-mail address when you donate so that we can e-mail you a receipt. 

Also, you may choose to receive occasional e-mail updates as we develop ActBlue. You can unsubscribe at any time by e-mailing [info@actblue.com](mailto:info@actblue.com). 

  * Information Sent to Campaigns  
When you contribute to candidates and committees on ActBlue, we are required to collect your  name, postal address, occupation, and employer, and to send this information along with your donation. We also record this information alongside your contribution amounts and recipients in our reports to the FEC. Each candidate receiving your donations may also include this information in their FEC reports, and is required to do so if you contribute more than $200 to their campaign. FEC reports containing this information are publicly available from the [FEC web site](http://fec.gov/). ActBlue submits its FEC reports on a monthly basis; most campaigns submit their reports quarterly.

Additionally, when you contribute **you may choose to share your phone number and e-mail address with campaigns**. 

  * Credit Card Information   
We securely transmit your credit card information to the payment processor, and do not store this information on our servers. We also request your phone number when you contribute so that we can reach you should further verification of your credit card information be required. 
  * Reports to fundraising page authors  
Authors of fundraising pages receive reports about donations made through the web pages they create. These reports include the dates, amounts, and recipients of these contributions. When you contribute to a user-created fundraising page, you may choose to share your name and contact information with the page author. If you choose not to do so, the author's report will list the donation as anonymous. (Your name will still be included in ActBlue's FEC reports as described above.) 
  * Use of third party vendors  
Credit card transaction processing on ActBlue.com is provided by [Tranvia](http://tranvia.com/), and our FEC reporting is automated by [Synetech Group](http://fecreporting.com/). ActBlue may share your personal data to these and other third parties in connection with the processing of your contributions or other services we offer. Any such third parties shall be required to maintain and use your information in accordance with our privacy policy. 



Other than as described above, we will not use your personal information nor release it to any other party without your permission, unless we believe it is necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, violations of our [terms of use](http://actblue.com/fineprint), or as otherwise required by law.
