**What Personally Identifiable Information About Customers Does AchooAllergy.com Gather?  
**  
The information we learn from customers helps us personalize and continually improve your shopping experience at AchooAllergy.com. We are the sole owners of the information collected on this site. We only have access to/collect information that you voluntarily give us via email or other direct contact from you. We will never sell or rent this information to anyone. Here are the types of information we gather. 

Information You Give Us: We receive and store any information you enter on our Web site or give us in any other way. We use the information that you provide for such purposes as responding to your requests, customizing future shopping for you, improving our store, and communicating with you. 

If you choose to contact us on our return/exchange or sales inquiry forms, we request certain personally identifiable information from you on those forms. You must provide contact information (such as name, email and order number). We use this information to respond to your inquiries and process any service requests. 

We will use your information to respond to you, regarding the reason you contacted us. We will not share your information with any third party outside of our organization, other than as necessary to fulfill your request, e.g. to ship an order. 

We request information from you on our order form. To buy from us, you must provide contact information (like name and shipping address) and financial information (like credit card number, expiration date). This information is used for billing purposes and to fill your orders. If we have trouble processing an order, we'll use this information to contact you. 

We use collected information primarily to fulfill customer orders and requests. We do not share this information with any third parties. However, we may disclose personally identifiable information collected if we have received your permission beforehand or in very special circumstances, such as when we believe that such disclosure is required by law or other special cases described below.   
Information provided during the checkout process is collected on our secure servers. That information is then used for final processing of your order. This information includes ordering information such as shipping and billing names and addresses, phone numbers, email addresses and credit card information.

Automatic Information: We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with us. For example, like many Web sites, we use "cookies," and we obtain certain types of information when your Web browser accesses AchooAllergy.com. 

**Newsletters and eBlasts**

Unless you ask us not to, we may contact you via email in the future to tell you about specials, new products or services, or changes to this privacy policy. You may opt out of these communications at any time by following the instructions at the top of every email we send or by contacting us at 1-800-339-7123.

**What About Tracking Technologies?  
**  
Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer's hard drive through your Web browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser and to provide customized features and storage of items in your Shopping Cart between visits. 

AchooAllergy.com does not collect any personally identifiable information via tracking technologies. Usage of cookies are in no way linked to any personally identifiable information on our site.

The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether.

The use of cookies by our partners, affiliates, tracking utility company, service providers is not covered by our privacy policy. We do not have access or control over these cookies. Our partners, affiliates, tracking utility company, service providers use session ID cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our site.

Our third party advertising partner employs a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers' personally identifiable information. 

**Tell-A-Friend**

If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about our site, we will ask you for your friend's name and email address.

**How Secure Is Information About Me?**

We take precautions to protect your information. When you submit sensitive information via the website, your information is protected both online and offline.

While we use encryption to protect sensitive information transmitted online, we also protect your information offline.

The computers/servers in which we store personally identifiable information are kept in a secure environment.
