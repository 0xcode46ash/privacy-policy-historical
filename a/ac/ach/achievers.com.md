## VISITING OUR WEBSITES

When you visit any _A_ chievers Websites and navigate from page to page or download content onto your computer, we record the pages that are visited and the content that is downloaded. 

We use this information to determine the number of people visiting our Websites and sections of the sites are visited most frequently. This helps us to determine the type of information that is most useful to our visitors so that we can improve our Websites and make it easier for you to access information.

_A_ chievers logs the date and time, the URL of the referring page (if applicable) and originating IP address of your computer or network that you use to access our sites. This is done for systems administration and security related purposes. Your IP address identifies the location of your computer on the internet.

## USE OF COOKIES ON OUR WEBSITES

_A_ chievers uses a browser feature called a “cookie” to collect information anonymously and track user patterns on _A_ chievers Websites. A cookie is a small text file that is placed on your hard disk by a Website. “Cookies” contain a unique identification number that identifies your browser, but not you, to our systems each time you visit one of our Websites. Cookies tell us which pages of our Websites are visited and by how many people. _A_ chievers does not collect any Personal Information (PII) about you through cookies nor can a cookie carry a damaging payload (such as malware).

There are two types of cookies in use with _A_ chievers Websites which include:

  * Session based cookies – Only used for the length of time you remain on the Website and expire when you leave the Website.
  * Persistent based cookies – Are more permanent in nature and can re-used when you return to the Website from the same computer.



The use of cookies is an industry standard and many major browsers are initially set up to accept them. You can reset your browser to either refuse to accept all cookies or to notify you when you have received a cookie. However, if you refuse to accept cookies, you may not be able to use some of the features available on our Websites.

## EMAIL

When you send us an e-mail or when you ask us to respond to you by e-mail, we collect your exact e-mail address and any information you have included in the e-mail message.

We use your e-mail address to acknowledge your comments and/or reply to your questions, and we will store your communication and our reply in case we correspond further. We may use your e-mail address to send you information about offers on products or special promotions that we believe may be of interest to you. If you don’t want us to contact you by e-mail with offers on products and special promotions, you may tell us by selecting the unsubscribe option at the bottom of the communication or by contacting the Privacy Office.

Remember that e-mail sent over the Internet is generally unencrypted and transmitted in clear text.

Confidential information should be transmitted to us through other secure methods as defined by _A_ chievers.
