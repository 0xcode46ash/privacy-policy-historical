# Privacy Policy

ACE Cash Express, Inc. understands that your privacy is very important to you. We want every customer, associate, and vendor to know how we protect a customer's financial privacy. This policy exists so that everyone can understand what our business practices are in handling the nonpublic personal information that is provided to ACE. ACE has one privacy policy for consumers that applies to all of ACE's brands, locations, companies, and subsidiaries.

ACE's policy applies to all nonpublic personal information about a customer that is obtained by ACE in connection with providing you with financial products or services. Our policy will continue to cover nonpublic personal information we may collect during the course of the customer relationship with ACE as well as after the relationship has ended.

ACE restricts access to nonpublic personal information about you to employees who need to know that information to provide products or services to you. We maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that comply with federal regulations to guard your nonpublic personal information.

In order to provide you with the products or services you request or to make you aware of financial products or services that might be of interest to you, we may disclose the information we collect, as described above, to companies that perform administrative or marketing services on our behalf or to other financial institutions with whom we have joint marketing agreements.
