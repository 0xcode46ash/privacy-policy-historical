This Privacy Policy is to inform you of our online information practices and the choices available regarding the collection and use of your information.  

  
**What we collect and how we collect it:**  
For each visitor browsing our website, our web sever automatically recognises and stores the visitor's IP address (the Internet address of the visitor's computer) to determine which areas of our site is being visited and how long each visitor spends there. This information helps us to understand visitors' traffic patterns through our website so that we can enhance the overall usability of our website. Your computer provides this information automatically each time you log on, unless you've activated blocking technologies available in some browsers. While we do not generally require that you provide us with individually identifiable information in order to visit and use our website, at times we may ask you to provide us with personal information such as your e-mail address, name, mailing address, telephone number, credit card number, demographic information, or a persistent identifier (such as user name and password), which is associated with individually identifiable information, to enable you to make a purchase, register a product, correspond with us, participate in an on-line survey, subscribe to a mailing list or newsletter, or register for special purchase discounts. If you choose not to provide it for those activities, you may not be able to participate in them.
