# Privacy - Acxiom

Taking a proactive approach in protecting consumer privacy has always been an important focus for Acxiom. We continuously seek ways to protect and assure appropriate use of information related to consumers and to promote policies within the industry that do the same.

Privacy is a priority for Acxiom as we deliver information management solutions across the globe. Our privacy principles guide how we do business every day. To review these principles, [click here](https://web.archive.org/about-acxiom/privacy/privacy-principles/ "Privacy Principles").

Acxiom has privacy policies for each region of the world where we have offices. We also have a privacy policy for our digital advertising products, and our acxiom.com corporate site which includes access to our digital information management services: Audience Operating System, AbiliTag Platform and Developers Portal. The choices available to a consumer vary with the region based on local laws and customs. The full list of policies is provided to the left.
