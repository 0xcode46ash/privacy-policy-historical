# ACD Systems Privacy Policy

We are committed to protecting your privacy and the privacy of information you provide to us.  **ACD Systems will never sell, rent, lease or even disclose customer information to third parties.**   Other terms of ACD Systems' privacy policy are as follows:

**Information Collection  
** When you engage in activities on our Web site like ordering or registering products, downloading trial versions of software or software updates, requesting technical support, or signing up for special offers or newsletters, ACD may ask you to provide us with information. Information we ask you to provide when purchasing or ordering will only be the information necessary to process your purchase or order. When fulfilling an order we will ask for your name, email address, address (for shipping purposes), telephone number and credit card number, type and expiration date. We will use this information only for matters related to your order unless you request otherwise. Your credit card information will be maintained only for a period reasonably necessary to ensure payment has been received.  

Additional information we may ask you to provide when choosing to engage in other activities on our website or within our products may include name, mailing address, telephone number, facsimile numbers, e-mail address, and other demographic information that will enable us to better understand the requirements of our customers and to continue to provide high quality products and service.  This information request will be optional and required only to engage in certain activities.  By choosing to enter the requested information when prompted, you may be eligible to receive demonstration versions of new software, extended functionality, user tips and product information, newsletters and special offers. 

Any information you post to a chat room or public bulletin is available to all users of that site. 

**How We Use Your Information  
** Any information collected will be used only by ACD Systems to improve our products, services and website.  ACD Systems uses information for internal purposes only and does not sell, lease or rent information to third parties.   

ACD Systems may use information it has collected to provide you with notices which you indicate would be of use or interest to you.  This may include notice of an ability to extend a products trial period, newsletters, website update notices, notification of the availability of new products, product updates as well as information on promotions and special offers.  You will be entitled to elect not to receive any further notices.  

If you enter into a trial period of ACD software, we may contact you via email to provide additional information on our products and to survey you on your satisfaction with our software.  We may also contact you to provide advance notice of termination of the trial period. Email is our preferred method of communication and we value the privilege to use it. 

ACD Systems may profile Web site activity and compile data in aggregate form in order to better understand user activities and the success of various ad campaigns.  This information is important to us as it enables us to continue to provide products specific to our customer's interests.   Site visitor behavior information is compiled in aggregate and does not represent individually identifiable information. 

ACD Systems may hire certain outside contractors to perform services on our behalf (such as packaging & shipping).  We will only provide those companies the personal information they need to complete the desired service.  They are not permitted to use customer information for any other purpose.

**Security of Your Personal Information  
** ACD Systems takes the protection of the personal information you provide very   
seriously.  Personal information collected is stored in password-controlled servers with limited access. When passing information over the Internet through ACD's InTouch service, information is protected through the use of encryption, specifically through the use of the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol.  However, perfect security on the Internet does not yet exist and we cannot warrant that our transfer of data is impenetrable or invulnerable to hackers. No personally identifiable information is transmitted across the Internet when using ACD's InTouch service, unless you choose to supply us with such information.  Information that may be transmitted includes [logging information](https://web.archive.org/web/20011214153140id_/http%3A//www.acdsystems.com/English/Company/logging) and [browser cookies](https://web.archive.org/web/20011214153140id_/http%3A//www.acdsystems.com/English/Company/cookies).

Information submitted to ACD may be transferred across national boundaries to or from our staff in other countries.  Internal data is shared through secured transmissions and maintained in secured databases.  ACD Systems will only disclose information if required to do so by law, legal process or if in good faith it is deemed necessary for the public interest.

ACD Systems may link website visitors to websites operated by third parties who are select partners of ACD Systems.  ACD Systems attempts to select reputable partners but does not guarantee the security of any personal information disclosed on those sites.

**Altering or Correcting Information  
** At any time you may review, alter or remove any personal information, including the permitted uses of your personal information, by contacting ACD Systems at:
