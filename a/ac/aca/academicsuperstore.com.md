## Security

Authentic Sites use Verisign SSL Web Server Certificates to offer secure communications by encrypting all data to and from the site. Verisign has checked and verified the company registration documents and the site's registered domain name. SSL encrypts all the information exchanged between your web server and your customers while in transit, which means that personal information and credit card details cannot be viewed by outside parties 

Always check any site's certificate before entering any sensitive information. 

As well, most browsers will show a lock icon, which means they are running security certificates, in the bottom status bar on secure pages. Look for this icon on any web page that asks for your personal information.
