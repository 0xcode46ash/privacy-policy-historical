At Academic Superstore, we are committed to protecting your privacy. We promise that your information is secure. We employ state-of-the-art SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) technology with a certificate provided by Thawte, a leader in Internet transaction security and encryption. We collect information about you to process your order and to help provide you with the best possible service. If you provide us with your postal address, e-mail address, or telephone number, you may receive our catalog or other promotional mailings, e-mails, or telephone calls. If you receive an e-mail from us that you would rather not receive, simply follow the unsubscribe instructions set forth at the bottom of each e-mail.

## Cookies

Our shopping cart software uses cookies - small files that contain a string of characters - to your computer that uniquely identifies your browser and allows you to use the site in a fast and efficient manner. The cookies are also used to speed up your return transactions. We do not gather personal data or information for any purpose other than completing a purchase transaction or for information you have requested. 

## Security

Authentic Sites use Verisign SSL Web Server Certificates to offer secure communications by encrypting all data to and from the site. Verisign has checked and verified the company registration documents and the site's registered domain name. SSL encrypts all the information exchanged between your web server and your customers while in transit, which means that personal information and credit card details cannot be viewed by outside parties 

Always check any site's certificate before entering any sensitive information. 

As well, most browsers will show a lock icon, which means they are running security certificates, in the bottom status bar on secure pages. Look for this icon on any web page that asks for your personal information. 

## Your email address is safe with us.

We never sell or share your email addresses with other companies. 

## You can unsubscribe at any time.

If you receive a newsletter or email and decide you don't like it, simply click the unsubscribe link at the bottom of the email.   
If you feel you've been sent unsolicited email and would like to register a complaint, please call our toll free number, 1-800-817-2347, or [email our abuse department](mailto:mailinglistabuse@academicsuperstore.com).

The information that you give us and information about your order may be combined with other personally identifiable information (such as demographic information and past purchase history) available from our records and other sources. This information will be used to make our future marketing efforts more efficient. This information may also be shared with other marketers to bring you offers of interest. If you prefer that we do not share your name and address with other marketers, please email us at [optout@AcademicSuperstore.com](mailto:optout@academicsuperstore.com).
