Privacy Policy

This statement covers the services provided by the Acas website: www.acas.org.uk / www.acas.co.uk / www.acas.gov.uk. It describes how we collect, protect and use information we receive from website visitors.

The Data Controller for this website is Acas.

Security and confidentiality

Acas safeguards the security of the data you send us with physical, electronic, and managerial procedures. Acas uses industry-standard Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption on all web pages where personal information is required.

Any information you provide will be held securely and in accordance with the Data Protection Act. Your personal details will not be sold or traded to third parties. In some circumstances however we may need to disclose your personal details to a third party so that they can provide a service you have requested, or fulfil a request for information. Any information about you that we pass to a third party will be held securely by that party, in accordance with the Data Protection Act, and used only to provide the services or information you have requested.

Information we collect from visitors

We collect several kinds of information from visitors to acas.org.uk depending on the part of the site being visited: registering for an event or online training, feedback, e-mail enquiries, placing a publication order, or participating in another site feature. 

By participating in these features we may ask you for your name, e-mail address, postal address, postcode, daytime and/or mobile phone number, credit/debit card information (when ordering products only) as well as to create a user name and password.

You may, however, visit parts of our site anonymously or purchase without registering. If you provide feedback on the Acas website through our on-line form at <http://www.acas.org.uk/feedback.html> we will only use this information to develop and improve the site.

Acas will give you the option to opt-in to receive Acas e-mails or mailings for marketing or informational purposes.

If you choose not to accept the cookie, this will not affect your access to the majority of facilities available on our website.

Although your browser may be set up to allow the creation of cookies, you can specify that you be prompted before a site puts a cookie on your hard disk, so that you can decide whether to allow or disallow the cookie. Alternatively, you can set your computer not to accept any cookie. If you turn cookies off, you may not have access to some features that make your site experience more efficient and some of our services may not function properly, such as placing an on-line order. Visitors who disable cookies can still place orders over the telephone by calling the appropriate stated number.
