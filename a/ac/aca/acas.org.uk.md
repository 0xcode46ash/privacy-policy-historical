# Acas - Acas privacy policy

****

This statement covers the services provided by the Acas website, www.acas.org.uk. It describes how we collect, protect and use information we receive from website visitors. The Data Controller for this website is Acas.

## Security and confidentiality

Acas safeguards the security of the data you send us with physical, electronic, and managerial procedures. We use industry-standard Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption on all pages where personal information is required.

Any information you provide will be held securely and in accordance with the Data Protection Act. Your personal details will not be sold or traded to third parties. In some circumstances we may need to disclose your personal details to a third party to provide a service you have requested or fulfil a request for information. Any information about you that we pass to a third party will be held securely by that party, in accordance with the Data Protection Act, and used only to provide the services or information you have requested.

## Information we collect from visitors

We collect several kinds of information from visitors, depending on the part of the site being visited: registering for an event or online training, feedback, email enquiries, placing a publication order or participating in another site feature.

By participating in these features we may ask you for your name, email address, postal address, postcode, daytime and/or mobile phone number, credit/debit card information (when ordering products only) as well as to create a user name and password.

You may, however, visit parts of our site anonymously or purchase without registering. If you provide online feedback on the Acas website, we will only use this information to develop and improve the site.

Acas retains the right to use information collected via our E-learning and training services for use with Acas mailings for marketing or informational (regarding promotions or changes to our services) purposes.[LW1]

## Data Protection Act 1998

If you have a complaint about an employment right or are responding to one, Acas will put some of the information you give us on to a computer. This helps us to monitor progress and produce statistics. Information may be passed to the Department for Business Regulation and Reform (BERR) to assist research into the use and effectiveness of Acas.
