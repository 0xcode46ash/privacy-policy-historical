# Privacy Policy | Academic Earth

Updated as of April 3, 2012

The following describes privacy practices of Academic Earth.

## Personal Information

### Non-Account Activity

You can watch videos on Academic Earth without having an Academic Earth Account. You can also contact us about a particular video without having an Academic Earth Account.

Certain other activities on Academic Earth—like adding favorites or posting comments—require you to have an Academic Earth Account. We ask for some personal information when you create an Academic Earth Account, including your email address and a password, which is used to protect your account from unauthorized access.

### Usage Information

We may record information about your usage, such as when you use Academic Earth, the videos you view, favorites you subscribe to, and the frequency and size of data transfers, as well as information you display or click on in Academic Earth (including UI elements, settings, and other information). If you are logged in, we may associate that information with your account. We may use clear GIFs (a.k.a. “Web Beacons”) in HTML-based emails sent to our users to track which emails are opened by recipients.

## Uses

If you submit personally identifiable information to us through the Academic Earth site, we use your personal information to operate, maintain, and provide to you the general and personalized features and functionality of the Academic Earth site, and to process any correspondence you send to us.

We do not use your email address or other personally identifiable information to send commercial or marketing messages without your consent or except as part of a specific program or feature for which you will have the ability to opt-in or opt-out. We may, however, use your email address without further consent for non-marketing or administrative purposes (such as notifying you of major Academic Earth Site changes or for customer service purposes).

We use both your personally identifiable information and certain non-personally-identifiable information (such as anonymous user usage data, cookies, IP addresses, browser type, clickstream data, etc.) to improve the quality and design of the Academic Earth Site and to create new features, promotions, functionality, and services by storing, tracking, analyzing, and processing user preferences and trends, as well as user activity and communications.

We use cookies, clear gifs, and log file information to: (a) store information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit the Academic Earth site; (b) provide custom, personalized content and information; (c) monitor the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns; and (d) monitor aggregate metrics such as total number of visitors, pages viewed, etc.

## Information That is Publicly Available

If you choose to use certain features, then your activity associated with these features may be aggregated and shared with other Users. Such shared activity may include what videos you favorite, how you rated videos, and what videos you have shared.

## Your Choices

You may, of course, decline to submit personally identifiable information through the Academic Earth Site, in which case you can still view videos and explore the Academic Earth Site, but Academic Earth may not be able to provide certain services to you.

You may update or correct your personal profile information and email preferences at any time by visiting your account profile page.
