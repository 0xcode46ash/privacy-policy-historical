Academy operates academy.com and academy.custhelp.com, but may also from time to time operate other websites for limited purposes such as surveys or promotions (for example, academysurvey.com). These websites are collectively referred to in this Policy as our "Websites".

Academy is committed to treating your personal information (such as name, address, e-mail address, telephone number, and payment card information) with certain care. Academy does not share customer personal information (including e-mail addresses) outside of our subsidiaries and affiliates other than as set forth in this Policy.

At Academy, we strive to limit access to your personal information to only those persons and individuals who use it for the purposes set forth in this Policy.

Academy uses technology used by many major websites to gather information about devices used to access our Websites. This may include a 'device's IP address, browser, domain and operating system information., This technology may also provide information about other pages accessed from or viewed from the device, and identification or verification information provided to our Site by such devices. This information can be obtained through the use of commonly used or standard data collection tools such as web server logs and cookies, as well as from the use of digital identification tools. Cookies are pieces of information that our Websites or other websites may transfer to your computer. Such information is helpful in enabling Academy and our partners and service providers to enhance your shopping experience and tailor our Websites and messages to your needs and preferences Server logs, digital identification tools and cookies also assist us by identifying the types of browsers and operating systems used most by visitors to our Websites, information about the applications or programs used by such systems.

Academy may use third-party advertising and analytics service providers to serve ads to you when you visit certain of our Websites or other websites (including on social media), and to analyze the use of our Websites and the effectiveness of our marketing efforts.

**6.** **How Academy Shares Information**

In order to operate our Websites and our retail stores, and provide you with the products and services you have requested, as well as ads and information that we believe may be of interest to you, we occasionally need to share information with third parties and with our subsidiaries and affiliates. We may share your information within our family of companies, including with subsidiaries and affiliates to allow uses of that information that are described in this Policy. For example, we may transmit your personal information to third-party service providers who assist us in processing orders and payments, shipping products, sending catalogs, performing surveys, conducting sweepstakes, processing job applications, sending e-mails and newsletters. Additionally, we transmit personal information to third-party credit card providers to help them decide whether to extend credit to a customer. We have agreements with these third-party service providers directing them to protect your _privacy_ by implementing similar security measures to those we employ and using your information only as authorized by Academy. In addition to our service providers, we also may provide information (for example, postal addresses, e-mail address, and telephone numbers) to certain outside companies and marketing partners so they can let you know about products or services that might be of interest. If you do not wish to receive such contact, please contact [Customer Care](https://academy.custhelp.com/)[.](https://academy.custhelp.com/)

We may also share your information upon your request, or when we believe it is permitted or required by law, or, in connection with a business acquisition of an Academy entity or one of our service providers, your information held by that entity may be transferred to an acquiring entity.

**7.** **How Academy Secures and Protects Your Information**

Academy takes information security very seriously, and protecting your personal information is an important priority. When you place an order through one of our Websites, we use several physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards designed to help make your information secure. For example, we may employ such industry-standard technology such as Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and encryption technology that works with all Internet browsers to provide a recognized high-level of security for online transactions. However, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.

Academy also has satisfied its requirements under the Payment Card Industry (" **PCI** ") security standards, which protects your credit card information by ensuring that it is processed, stored, and transmitted in a secure manner. We use your personal information to fulfill your orders and requests, and we do not retain your credit card information. We currently use a third-party processor for credit card information, so you provide your information directly to that processor, not to us.

If you are still unsure about the security of your information traveling across the Internet, you can place an order with us by calling Customer Care toll-free at 1-888-922-2336, between 7:00 a.m. and 12:00 a.m. Central Time.

  * using the Unsubscribe link at the bottom of each e-mail sent by Academy;
  * using our online form;
  * sending a "stop" message to 22369 to unsubscribe from SMS text messaging; or
  * contacting Customer Care at 1-888-922-2336.

If you sign up for our mobile offers, our terms and conditions, including disclosures of dialing technology and that consent is not a requirement for purchase, are provided with any invitation to register.

If you provide us with your postal address while in one of our stores, on our Websites, or through other means, you may receive periodic advertisements, circulars, or other promotional materials from us. If you do not wish to receive postal mailings from Academy, or third-party organizations, please notify Academy by using our Online Form. Please provide us with your name and postal address, and identify which lists you wish to be removed from, so that we can be sure your information is deleted from the appropriate mailing lists.

If a California resident who is under 18 chooses to express an opinion in an online forum or otherwise post information for others to view on our Website, those opinions and information can always be removed by the minor who posted them by simply following the instructions posted on the forum.

We may receive personal information from a social media page when you connect through a social media feed, post content, or otherwise interact with us using social media tools. For example, we may receive basic Facebook account information through our Facebook Page(s). Also, when you "like," "subscribe to," or send a "tweet" to us through social media, we may receive your username, handle, and any other available personal information from the social media website. All information received from social media websites may be used by us in the same manner and for the same purposes as described in this Policy with respect to similar information we obtain through our Website, including to allow us to send and tailor messages that we believe may be of interest to you.
