We at AccountingWEB, Inc. value the relationship we have with our members and Web site visitors, and are committed to responsible information handling practices. We take the privacy of our members/customers very seriously and want you to feel comfortable whenever you visit our Web site, access our online services, or participate in our online offerings. This online privacy policy represents AccountingWEB, Inc.'s general privacy approach to the information practices of our Web site. Our approach to responsible information handling is founded on the basis of the Fair Information Practices Act , the cornerstone of which is providing notice of our information practices and other privacy aspects in order to allow individuals to make informed decisions regarding personally identifiable information. Furthermore, it is the policy of AccountingWEB, Inc. to respect and protect the privacy of its' users. 

**Providing Information to Third Parties**  
AccountingWEB, Inc. will not sell our member/customer list to any third party nor will we willfully provide any individual information of our users to any vendor, supplier, advertiser or potential advertiser. 

**Information Collection – General**  
When you visit our Web site, information may be requested of you in order for you to participate more fully in our online offerings, services and to better profile our members so they can have a much more meaningful experience while visiting our site. When we collect information from you, we let you know what is being collected, how it is collected, and for what purpose(s) it is collected. We also identify the information that is necessary to fulfill your request. Whenever we request additional or optional information, we mark those as voluntary so that you know it is not required to provide the requested service. 

You may browse our Web site as a visitor without providing any personal information to us. However, if you want full access to the site, wish to receive or our online products and services, or participate in other online activities (e.g., surveys, contests, workshops and member comments), we request that you provide us with some additional information about yourself. When you provide personal information to us that may be used for secondary purposes (i.e., uses not related to the purpose for which the information was collected), we give you the opportunity to opt-out of such uses. 

**Registration**  
In order to gain full access to our Web site, visitors are required to complete a simple registration form. During registration a user is required to give contact information (such as name, e-mail address and phone number). It is optional for the user to provide demographic information (such as income level and gender), and unique identifiers. 

**Product/Service Purchases**  
Additional information is requested from users wishing to purchase products and services from our Web site. Purchasers have to provide contact information (such as name and billing address) and financial information (such as credit card number and expiration date). This additional information is used for billing purposes and to fulfill customer orders. If we have trouble processing a customer order, this contact information will be used to get in touch with the user.

**Security**  
When our registration/order form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card information), that information is encrypted. While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, as will be the case for most of the time that a user is browsing the Web.

If you make a purchase from our site, the information obtained during your visit, and the information that you give such as your credit card number and contact information, is provided to the merchant of record. These merchants have separate privacy and data collection practices. AccountingWEB has no responsibility or liability for these independent policies.

**Cookies**  
A cookie is a small text file written to a user’s hard drive that contains the User ID. The cookies do not contain any personal information about users. The use of cookies is now widespread. The reason we use cookies is to save our users time on the site (so that users do not have to log in with a password more than once); and also so that we can personalize a user's experience of the site. 

If a user sets up his browser to reject the cookie, he or she may still use the site although functionality will be impaired. 

**Banner Ads**  
We occasionally use third-party advertising companies to serve our ads on our site. These third-party advertising companies employ cookies and 1x1 pixel .gif or Web beacons to measure and improve the effectiveness of ads for their advertising clients. To do so, these companies may use anonymous information about your visits to our Web site and other Web sites you visit throughout the day. This information can include: date/time of banner ad shown, the banner ad that was displayed, their cookie, the IP address etc.. This information can also be used for online preference marketing purposes.

If you want to prevent a third-party advertiser from collecting data, currently you may either visit each ad network's Web site individually and opt out or visit the NAI gateway opt-out site. This site will also allow you to review the third-party advertising companies' privacy policies. Please go to [Network Advertising](http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp)

**Log Files**  
Logs of Web site traffic are collected and include information such as IP addresses, browser types and cookie information. This information is collected to analyze trends, administer the site and to calculate overall activity. Personally identifiable traffic patterns are not disclosed to any third parties. 

**Links**  
This Web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that AccountingWEB is not responsible for the privacy practices of any other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of these third party sites. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this Web site.

**Correcting/Updating Personal Information**  
If a user’s personally identifiable information changes (such as the zip code), or if a user no longer desires our service, we will try to provide a way to correct, update or remove that user’s personal data provided to us. This can usually be done at the personal profile page or by sending an email to [service@accountingweb.com](mailto:service@accountingweb.com). Please allow 14 business days for all cancellations, changes etc. sent to [service@accountingweb.com](mailto:service@accountingweb.com).

**Notification of Changes**  
If our Privacy Policy changes, we will post those changes on our Web site so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If at any point we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify users by way of an e-mail. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner. We will use information in accordance with the Privacy Statement under which the information was collected.

We are committed to protecting the privacy of our members/customers and Web site visitors. Should you have any questions or concerns about this privacy policy or the practices of our web site, please contact us at [service@accountingweb.com](mailto:service@accountingweb.com).
