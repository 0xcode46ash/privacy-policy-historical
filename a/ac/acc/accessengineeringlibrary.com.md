# Privacy Notice - Access Engineering from McGraw-Hill

[Home](http://accessengineeringlibrary.com/)

When you subscribe to _**Access** Engineering_, register for a trial subscription, or register for individual access to the site, we collect certain personal information, such as your name, address, and e-mail address. We use this information to process your order and for administration of your subscription. Your e-mail address is added to our electronic mailing list so that, from time to time, we can send you information about new features, additions, and changes to our Web site. If you do not want to receive e-mail alerts, you may indicate this on your registration form, and you can change this at any time by logging into My _**Access** Engineering_ and updating your profile information, or by contacting Customer Service by e-mail at [OnlineCustomer_Service@mcgraw-hill.com](mailto:OnlineCustomer_Service@mcgraw-hill.com). 

Also, _**Access** Engineering_ may occasionally make subscriber information available to other units within The McGraw-Hill Companies as well as to selected outside companies whose products or services we feel may be of interest to you. 

If you are an individual user, you may also review and request changes to your profile information online at any time by logging into My _**Access** Engineering_, or by contacting Customer Service by e-mail at [OnlineCustomer_Service@mcgraw-hill.com](mailto:OnlineCustomer_Service@mcgraw-hill.com). 

_**Access** Engineering_ makes use of a type of cookie called a "session" cookie. Cookies are small bits of data that we send to your computer. We use them to improve your user experience. We use them to keep track of the fact that you have signed in so that you don't have to continually enter your user name and password as you move around the site. This type of cookie is removed as soon as you log out or close your browser. 

An IP address is a number that's automatically assigned to your computer whenever you're surfing the Web. Web servers, the big computers that "serve up" Web pages, automatically identify your computer by its IP address. We collect IP addresses for the purposes of system administration, to report aggregate information to our institutional customers, and to audit the use of our site. When visitors request pages from _**Access** Engineering_, our servers log the visitors' IP addresses. We do not normally link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable, which means that a user's session will be logged, but the user remains anonymous to us. We can and will use IP addresses to identify a user when we feel it is necessary to enforce compliance with our house rules or terms of service or to protect our service, site, customers, or others. 

Please be assured that we take your concerns about privacy quite seriously, and we intend to take every reasonable effort to protect it. To that end, The McGraw-Hill Companies has developed a comprehensive customer privacy policy. If you'd like more information about our use of customer data, please review The McGraw-Hill Companies Customer Privacy Policy at [www.mcgraw-hill.com/privacy.html](http://www.mcgraw-hill.com/privacy.html). 

If you have questions or comments about our customer privacy policy or you would like to confirm the accuracy of the information collected from you, please write: Privacy Officer, McGraw-Hill Professional, 2 Penn Plaza, 9th Floor, New York, NY 10121.

To learn more about how McGraw-Hill Professional applies this Policy, you can contact [privacy@mhedu.com](mailto:privacy@mhedu.com). If you are an individual trial user or an individual subscriber, you may also review and request changes to the information online at any time by going to the Subscriber Services section.
