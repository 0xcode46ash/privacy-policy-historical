Like most sites, AccuRadio.com and its affiliate sites will automatically receive and store certain types of non-personally identifiable information whenever you visit. This information includes your IP address, browser type, etc. Also, like most sites, we use cookies to store certain information such as your artist deselects. Again, the information we collect automatically cannot be used to identify you personally, nor can it be used to send you spam or target you for viruses or other types of malware.

We sometimes use this non-personally identifiable information to improve the design and content of our site. We may also use this information in the aggregate to analyze site usage, and that information may be shared with our advertisers and clients.

We will often link to sites who privacy policies differ from ours. Visitors should consult the other site's privacy notices, as we have no control over information that is submitted to or collected by these third parties.
