# AccuRadio - The Next Generation of Radio

Like most sites, AccuRadio.com and its affiliate sites will automatically receive and store certain types of **non-personally identifiable** information whenever you visit. This information includes your IP address, browser type, etc. Also, like most sites, we use cookies to store certain information such as your artist deselects. Again, the information we collect automatically cannot be used to identify you personally, nor can it be used to send you spam or target you for viruses or other types of malware.

We sometimes use this non-personally identifiable information to improve the design and content of our site. We may also use this information in the aggregate to analyze site usage, and that information may be shared with our advertisers and clients.

We will often link to sites who privacy policies differ from ours. Visitors should consult the other site's privacy notices, as we have no control over information that is submitted to or collected by these third parties.

If you have any questions or concerns about the AccuRadio privacy policy for this site or any of it's implementations, you may contact us using our [feedback system](https://web.archive.org/feedback/index.aspx). 

Third party advertising

AccuRadio.com utilizes several advertising services such as Google AdSense, Fastclick, and Advertising.com. These companies may use cookies and automatically collected information about your visits to this and other web sites in order to provide advertisements that may be of interest to you. The information they use is not personally identifiable, and does not contain your name, email address, physical address, or phone number. 

In addition, AccuRadio.com does not condone advertisers who attempt to install spyware or other kinds of malware onto your system, advertisers who make false claims to collect personal information, or advertisers who utilise sound or "browser takeover" methods in the advertisements themselves. Though they will occasionally slip through, rest assured that we do our best to prevent these kinds of advertisements from being displayed on our site.
