## Security Code

We require certain information when entering your payment details if you are using a debit or credit card. One of these is your Security Code. This is usually found on the back of your credit or debit card (above the signature strip) and is the last 3 digits of the code. For American Express, it is a 4 digit code found on the front of the card.

## Security

The Monsoon Accessorize website uses a secure server. All your personal information and credit card information between your PC and the server are transmitted in an encrypted form.

Furthermore, your credit card details are not stored on a server accessible via the Internet. This is a further step for your protection only available by leading ecommerce sites.

Our account pages and checkout pages use SSL certificates (Secure Socket Layer) provided by COMODO ([ www.comodo.com](http://www.comodo.com/) ). Details of these can be obtained by clicking on the padlock or secure site icon which will appear in the address bar of your browser when you are on a secure page (https instead of http).

Can't access secure pages?  
If you are having trouble getting into secure pages, it may be because your browser, your corporate firewall or proxy has not been set up to allow access to secure pages. In these cases contact IT support at your company.

_Many companies access the Internet using a specially programmed computer known as a 'Firewall'. Any data coming in or going out has to get past the firewall first. The firewall may contain programs that mediate access between the Internet and the user._

Verified by Visa and Mastercard® SecureCode™ 

To give you even more confidence in shopping online with monsoon.co.uk and accessorize.com, we have introduced Verified by Visa and Mastercard® SecureCode™. These services enhance your existing card account against unauthorised use when you shop with us.

To use this service, you must first register with the bank or other organisation that issued your card. You can usually do this when presented with the secure code page for the first time. To find out more about these services:

Click here to visit the Verified by Visa website

Click here to visit the Mastercard® SecureCode™ website 

Once you've registered and created your own private password with your card issuer, you will be automatically prompted at checkout to provide this password each time you make a purchase. Please note: Your Verified by Visa or Mastercard SecureCode™ password is not your monsoon.co.uk or accessorize.com account password. Monsoon Accessorize does not have access to your Verified by Visa or Mastercard SecureCode™ password. You must contact your card issuer for further assistance.
