**ACCESSDATA PRIVACY STATEMENT**

**Our Privacy Policy Outlined**  
AccessData respects your right to privacy and understands that visitors to AccessData.com want to be in control of their personal information. AccessData presents information on AccessData.com that is tailored to the needs of our visitors. For this reason, we may ask you to register or to provide personal information when you visit certain areas of AccessData.com, including our download free software section, any contest or events section, or to subscribe to our newsletter. 

We will use the personal information you share with us to ensure the content, services, and advertising that we provide on AccessData.com are tailored to your current and future needs. If you provide AccessData.com with your mailing address or telephone number, AccessData and its partners may use this information to alert you to product upgrades, special offers, updated information, and new services. If you provide your e-mail address, AccessData may contact you via e-mail as well. If you do not want AccessData, our partners, or selected third parties to contact you, you may opt out when you provide personal information or contact AccessData directly at [webmaster@accessdata.com](mailto:webmaster@accessdata.com)

If you choose not to register or provide personal information, you can still visit most of AccessData.com. However, you will not have access to areas that require personal identification. 

**AccessData Protects Your Personal Information**  
AccessData will protect the personal information that you share with us. If you make a purchase on-line, we will use your credit card number only to process your payment and will not use it for marketing purposes. If we request demographic information, we will not share information about you as an individual with any other entity. If we do share demographic information with third parties, we will give them aggregate information only. 

AccessData may carefully select third parties to send you information, by postal mail, about their products or services. If you do not want to receive information, you may decline to receive it (or "opt out") when you provide personal information to AccessData, or you may contact us directly. 

AccessData may occasionally present a special contest or promotion. To qualify for entry, we may ask you to provide personal information. If we plan to share that information with any sponsor(s), we will provide a statement to that effect. 

**How to Update Your Personal Information**  
You can help AccessData maintain the accuracy of your personal information by notifying us when you change your address, title, phone number, or e-mail address.
