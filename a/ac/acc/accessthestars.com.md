Access The Stars never provides information to third party advertisers or partners. We will not make use of any personally identifiable information that we gather from individual clients or visitors, except as needed to prepare our astrological readings.

To provide our astrological readings, we will ask you for your name, e-mail address, mailing address, zip code, country, gender, birthdate and age. But, we do not use this information for any other purpose than to satisfy your request.

Access The Stars uses e-mail to receive orders and to return astrological answers and readings to our clients. However, we never send uninvited e-mail to our clients. After we have filled your order, do not expect any subsequent e-mails from Access The Stars.
