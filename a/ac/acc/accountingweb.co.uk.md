Sift Media is the sole owner of the personal information collected from this Website.

During registration a user is required to give contact information (such as name, email address, and selected information about the company that you work for).

It is optional for the user to provide certain demographic information (such as income level and gender), however we encourage the full completion of the registration form so that we can refine our editorial content and provide a more personalised experience.

**Order forms**  
We sometimes may request additional information from users on order forms. Users have to provide contact information (such as name and delivery address) and financial information (such as credit card number and expiry date). This information is used for billing purposes and to fulfill customer orders. If we have trouble processing an order, this contact information is used to get in touch with the user.
