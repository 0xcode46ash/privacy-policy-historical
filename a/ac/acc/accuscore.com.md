1.1 PURPOSE OF POLICY.  
Orion Data Analysis Corporation, a California corporation that operates this AccuScore.com website (“us,” “we” or “Company”), is committed to respecting the privacy rights of its customers, visitors, and other users of this website (the “Site”). We created this Website Privacy Policy (this “Policy”) to give you confidence as you visit and use the Site, and to demonstrate our commitment to fair information practices and the protection of privacy. This Policy is only applicable to the Site, and not to any other websites that you may be able to access from the Site, each of which may have data collection and use practices and polices that differ materially from this Policy.

PLEASE NOTE: Our Site is operated for an adult audience only, and we require users to be at least 18 years of age. We do not intend for anyone under the age of 18 to use any of the features or services we offer from the Site, and we certainly do not direct any of our content specifically at children under 13 years of age. We understand and are committed to respecting the sensitive nature of children’s privacy online. If we learn or have reason to suspect that a Site user is under age 13, we will promptly delete any personal information in that user’s account. If we learn or have reason to suspect that a Site user is between the age of 13 and 18, we will continue to store that user’s information for the sole purpose of prohibiting any further use of the Site by him or her.
