**Privacy Policy**

We take the privacy of our visitors to accelerated-ideas.com very seriously.

We recognize that the privacy of your personal information is paramount. Below we have detailed the types of personal information we receive and collect when you use and visit accelerated-ideas.com, and how we safeguard your private information. Like all professional websites, we never sell your personal information to third parties or suppliers.

Website Log Files  
As with most modern websites, our team collects and uses data contained in server log files. This information includes IP addresses, your ISP (internet service provider, such as AOL or BT), the type of browser you used to visit our site (such as Google Chrome, Internet Explorer or Firefox), the date and time you visited our site and which pages you visited on our site.

Cookies  
We do use cookies to store information, such as your personal preferences when you visit our site. This can include showing you a popup once during your visit, or the ability to login to some of our features, such as forums that you are participating in.

We also use third party advertisements on accelerated-ideas.com to support our sites development. Some of these advertisers may use technology such as cookies and when they advertise on our site, which will also send these advertisers (such as Google through the Google AdSense program) information including your IP address, your ISP , the browser you used to visit our site, and in some cases, whether you have Flash installed. This is generally used for geotargeting purposes (showing New York real estate ads to someone in New York, for example) or showing certain ads based on specific sites visited (such as showing cooking ads to someone who frequents cooking sites).

DoubleClick DART cookies  
Our site uses the DART cookie for ad serving through Google’s DoubleClick, which places a cookie on your computer when you are browsing the web and visit a site using DoubleClick advertising (including some Google AdSense advertisements). This cookie is used to serve ads specific to you and your interests (interest based targeting). The ads served will be targeted based on your previous browsing history (For example, if you have been viewing sites about visiting London, you may see London hotel advertisements when viewing a non-related site, such as on a site about Football). DART uses “non personally identifiable information”. It does NOT track personal information about you, such as your name, email address, physical address, telephone number, bank account numbers or credit cards. You can opt-out of this ad serving on all sites using this advertising by visiting  
http://www.doubleclick.com/privacy/dart_adserving.aspx.

You can choose to disable or selectively turn off our cookies or third-party cookies in your browser settings, or by managing preferences in programs such as Norton Internet Security. However, this can affect how you are able to interact with our site as well as other websites. This could include the inability to login to services or programs, such as logging into forums or accounts.

Deleting cookies does not mean you are permanently opted out of any advertising program. Unless you have settings that disallow cookies, the next time you visit a site running the advertisements, a new cookie will be added.

**Note:**  
Users of Googles Adsense program must update their Privacy Policy by **April 8th 2009**. This new privacy policy must include the new Google **Double Click DART cookie**. Web designers may use our Privacy Policy on their own websites. Just replace the references to our site name and include your own advertising programs in the list.
