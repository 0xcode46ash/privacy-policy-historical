# Privacy | ACCC

The ACCC is subject to the _Privacy Act 1988_ and the Information Privacy Principles contained in that Act. The Information Privacy Principles set out the manner in which Australian Government agencies can collect, store, use and disclose personal information and how a person can access records containing their personal information.

### When you visit our site

Our objective in maintaining an active and expanding site is to improve communication with the community at large, specifically to:

  * make it possible to quickly provide information about our activities
  * encourage feedback from you.



This site is operated by the ACCC using both Australian Government and commercial web hosting facilities. When visiting this site, a record of your visit is logged. The following clickstream data is recorded and is used by us for statistical purposes:

  * your server address
  * your top level domain name (for example .com, .gov, .au, .uk etc)
  * the type of browser you are using
  * your operating system (for example Windows, Mac etc)
  * the date and time of the visit to the site
  * the pages accessed and the documents downloaded
  * the internet address of the site from which you linked directly to our site.



No attempt will be made to identify users or their browsing activities except in the unlikely event of an investigation when a law enforcement agency or other government agency may exercise its legal authority to inspect our internet web server logs.

### When you subscribe to email alerts

When you subscribe to email alerts you must provide an email address to which the system can send your alerts. We will not use your email address to send you unsolicited information.

### When you contact us

Any other personal information collected by us will only be collected:

  * for a lawful purpose directly related to a function or activity of the ACCC.
  * when it is necessary for or directly related to that lawful purpose
  * by lawful and fair means.



The ACCC may collect personal information about you when you:

  * complete an electronic complaints or enquiries form
  * send us an email
  * make phone complaints and inquiries
  * send correspondence to any of the ACCC offices.



The information collected will be used to help us perform our duties or functions and may be provided to other regulatory agencies where appropriate. We may also disclose information in accordance with the law (for example, court orders).

However, when requested, we will seek to ensure that a complainant remains anonymous or details of the complaint itself remain confidential. As some complaints are also inherently confidential in nature, even if a complainant does not make such a request, we will seek to protect the complainant if disclosure would have a substantially adverse effect on the complainant.

Our site does not provide facilities for the secure transmission of information across the internet. You should be aware that there are inherent risks transmitting information across the internet.

A cookie is a piece of data that a site can send to your browser, which may then be stored on your computer as an anonymous tag that identifies your computer but not you. Our site uses cookies to better serve you when you return to the website. You can set your browser to notify you before you receive a cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether to accept it. You can also set your browser to turn off cookies. If you do so, however, some pages in the site may not work properly.

Cookies are either persistent or session based. Persistent cookies are stored on your computer, contain an expiration date, and may be used to track your browsing behaviour upon return to the issuing site. Session cookies are short-lived, are used only during a browsing session, and expire when you quit your browser.

Our site uses both kinds of cookies to provide a rich and session based experience. The cookies are used to enable us to track users browsing patterns in order to provide statistical information to improve the usability of the site.

The ACCC will store, use and disclose personal information in a manner consistent with our obligations under the _Privacy Act 1988_ and the Information Privacy Principles

We do not generally use information collected from our site for any other purpose than to improve services or to respond to complaints, enquiries, or feedback. When you provide us with an email address, it will not be added to a mailing list unless you have specifically requested this.

No data collected from the site will be disclosed to a third party except where it is legally required, such as in the investigation of a criminal offence, or in compliance with a search warrant or subpoena.

If you want to

  * obtain access to your personal information
  * make a complaint about a breach of your privacy
  * query how your personal information is collected, used or disclosed
  * ask questions about our Privacy Statement
