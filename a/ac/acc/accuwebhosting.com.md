Accu Web Hosting not only provides Cheap Web Hosting and Free Domain Registration, they offer you one of the most patient and dedicated support staff I have ever seen. They solved a really complicated domain transfer, I was informed on every spot of the operation and they make the hard work or me. Five stars for you AccuWEB!!!

Although I rarely do this, I just wanted to write in and say thanks for keeping up on issues such as this. You guys are the best registrar I've done business with and it's nice to know that you are staying ahead of the game and on top of issues such as this. Keep up the great work guys!!  
**J.Xavier

I just wanted to let you guys at AccuWebHosting know how utterly pleased I am with your service. I have been a Network Solutions/Verisign customer for several years  
now and have had nothing  
but headaches with them.  
When I made the decision  
to move my domains, NSI effectively locked my contact information, preventing me from completing the move. I discovered that the best way to transfer a domain from NSI is to let it expire and use namewinner to nab it with AccuWebHosting. I love how I can now update my DNS information almost instantly. Keep up the good work!
