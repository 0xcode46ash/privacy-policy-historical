We may use the information to research and understand how our users' habits in the aggregate are similar or different so that we can enhance your experience on AccuWebHosting.com' sites and with our products. With your consent, cookies can optionally store information from forms that you fill out on our site so that next time you visit, you do not have to re-enter this information. We treat any personally identifiable information with confidentiality. You can set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether or not to accept it. AccuWebHosting.com does not require that you accept cookies.

You will not be personally identified from this information. 

IP addresses are used by your computer every time you are connected to the Internet.
