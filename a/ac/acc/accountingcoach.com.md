### **Our Commitment To Privacy**

Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used.

  
  


### **The Information We Collect**

The following notice (items 1-5) applies to all information collected or submitted on the AccountingCoach.com website.

  1. **Signing up for our email newsletter**  
On some pages you can sign up to receive our free email newsletter. We collect your first name and email address only. We use this information only when sending you our latest newsletter messages. We will never provide your personal information to any third party and promise to only send relevant information pertaining to our website AccountingCoach.com.

  


We follow all rules and regulations put forth in the ******[CAN-SPAM Act](http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/edu/pubs/business/ecommerce/bus61.shtm)**. You can unsubscribe yourself from our email list at any time by clicking the unsubscribe link found at the end of each and every email we send.

  

  2. **Purchasing one of our products**  
We use **[PayPal](https://www.paypal.com/us/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=xpt/general/Privacy-outside)** and **[Google Checkout](https://checkout.google.com/)** to process all payments made online. These are two of the safest ways to send payments online. Most importantly, it allows you as the consumer the comfort of knowing none of your credit card information will be shared with us.

We do collect your name, email address, and sometimes home address for the sole purpose of properly delivering the product you ordered. None of this personal information will be used for any purpose other than delivering the product you ordered and notifying you when important updates become available.

  

  3. **Registering to participate in our online forum**  
We collect the username and email address you provide when registering to use our online forum. We do not use this information for any purpose; however, we at this community reserve the right to reveal your identity (or whatever information we know about you) in the event of a complaint or legal action arising from any message posted by you. We log all internet protocol addresses accessing this web site.   
You can read more about our **[Terms of Service](https://web.archive.org/accounting/termsofservice.php)**.

  

  4. **Emailing a friend about our website**  
On some pages we allow you to email a friend who might be interested in certain pages of our website. We ask you to supply your email address so when your friend wants to reply to the email, the reply comes to you, and not to us.

We do not store any email addresses, and your email address will simply be gone after the program has finished the procedure, and you see the final page. We do store your email address in a cookie on your computer. If you ever use the service again, we'll "know" your email address and name, and you don't have to fill out those lines anymore.

  

  5. **Tracking and statistics**  
We use non-identifying and aggregate information to better design our website and to share with advertisers. For example, we may tell an advertiser that X number of individuals visited a certain area on our website, or that Y number of men and Z number of women filled out our registration form, but we would not disclose anything that could be used to identify those individuals. 


  


### **Our Commitment To Data Security**
