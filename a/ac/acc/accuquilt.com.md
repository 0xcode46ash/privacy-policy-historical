## AccuQuilt's Privacy Philosophy 

  
Your privacy on the Internet is important to us. Because we gather certain types of information about AccuQuilt users, we want you to understand the terms and conditions surrounding the capture and use of that information. This privacy statement discloses what information we gather, how we use it, and how to correct or change it.

  


## Information that AccuQuilt Gathers 

AccuQuilt gathers two types of information about users: 

1\. **Personal data** , provided through voluntary registration  


2\. **Aggregated data** , which tracks users as a whole

**Personal data** may be requested when you sign up for AccuQuilt's personalized services or register for contests, sweepstakes or other promotional programs offered on our service. We ask for this in order to provide you with the best Web site experience possible. This information might include member name, password, age, gender, ZIP code and/or country information. Except as described below, it is not disclosed to parties other than AccuQuilt and its parent companies in any way that personally identifies you without your prior permission. 

**Aggregated data** , which tracks AccuQuilt user activity as a whole rather than on an individual basis, is gathered through several methods. This tracking data follows AccuQuilt traffic in general, and is not used to identify you personally.

Aggregated tracking information helps us to determine which areas of our site users like and don't like based on traffic to those areas. AccuQuilt does not track what you read, but rather how well each page performs overall. This helps us continue to build a better service for you.

  


##  How AccuQuilt Uses Information 

  


AccuQuilt uses any personal information that's voluntarily given by you in order to enhance your experience, whether to provide interactive or personalized elements on the site or to better prepare future content based on the interests of our users. AccuQuilt also uses information that you voluntarily provide in order to send electronic updates and to let you participate in polls and message boards.

AccuQuilt will not disclose any information that personally identifies you to parties other than AccuQuilt and its parent company without your consent. There are exceptions:

• When the purpose and manner of disclosure is clearly defined in advance.  


• When we believe in good faith that disclosure is legally required or to protect our rights.

AccuQuilt occasionally offers contests and sweepstakes in which we request certain personal information on a voluntary basis. These contests and sweepstakes are conducted in full accordance with United States federal and state laws.

As a measure of user interest, we track search terms that are entered into our site. We create aggregate reports on user demographics and traffic patterns to improve shopping and user experiences.

A cookie is a small data file that Web sites commonly write to your hard drive when you visit them. A cookie file contains information that can identify you anonymously in order to track traffic patterns on our site. The data is encrypted for your added security. AccuQuilt uses cookies as a way to measure activity on the site in order to continually improve your experience.
