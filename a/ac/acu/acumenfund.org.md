# Privacy Policy | Acumen

### We Care About Your Privacy

At Acumen Fund, Inc. (“Acumen”), we understand and appreciate that your decision to choose us for your philanthropic investment is an expression of confidence. You trust us with your investment and you trust us to keep secure any information we obtain from you or about you. We understand that privacy is important, and we are strongly committed to protecting the privacy of both our current and prospective investors as well as visitors to our website.

The following notice is designed to help you better understand the information we gather from investors and from those who visit our site. It also describes how we handle the information once we gather it, whether we disclose it to anyone, and the choices you have regarding our use of the information. Please note that this Privacy Policy applies only to Acumen and our website and not necessarily to other companies with whom we work or to organizations’ websites to which we may link. By sharing information with Acumen or by visiting this site, you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Policy.

### Information Collection and Use

Our primary goals in collecting personal information are to share information about our work, to invite you to events designed to update you on Acumen’s activities, to allow you to request information, and to thank you for your support.

### Aggregate Data Collected Online

When you browse our site, non-personal information about you is recorded by Acumen’s Internet servers. This information is used primarily to provide an enhanced online experience. Information tracked may include, but is not limited to the type of operating system in use [e.g. Macintosh, Windows] and the domain name and the type of browser being used [e.g. Internet Explorer, Firefox, etc.]. This information may be used to review the number of visitors to our site and the specific pages visited, but only in an aggregate and in a non-personally-identifiable form. E-mail addresses and other personally identifiable data about visitors to this site are known only when voluntarily submitted.

### Personally Identifiable Information

****If you make a donation to Acumen, we will request personally identifiable information about you, such as your name, address, phone number and email address. We seek such information to facilitate your donation and communicate with you about it. In addition, we may use this information to update you on Acumen’s work and to request your attendance at events such as our Investor Gathering to increase your knowledge of Acumen’s investments, to improve our marketing and promotional efforts, and to answer any questions that you may have.

Unless you specify that a gift be “anonymous” or otherwise request that your name not be listed, we list the names of our Sustaining Partners, Partners & Associate Partners in our website, brochures and other materials to recognize the generosity of those who support Acumen Fund. We do not sell or rent our donor lists to anyone. We also do not share your personal data with any third parties other than service providers we employ to perform functions on our behalf, such as sending postal mail and email, processing credit card payments and organizing events specifically designed to keep you abreast of Acumen’s activities. These companies and individuals have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but are not authorized to use it for any other purpose.

The portions of our website that collect data from you, so that Acumen may provide you with information, will also provide you with the flexibility of obtaining the same or similar information by downloading the data or by contacting the Marketing Department directly, whether via the phone or in writing. You may always use these means as a way of obtaining information and as an alternative to submitting your data to us through our website.

### Security

We care about the security of your personal data and we employ several different security techniques to protect your personally identifiable information from unauthorized access by users inside and outside the organization. You should be aware, however, that “perfect security” does not exist and that unauthorized third parties may unlawfully intercept or access private data. You provide us with this information at your own risk.

### Sharing Information

As a matter of policy, we will not sell, share or rent information about you in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement. However, we may be forced to disclose information to the federal or state government or law enforcement agencies under certain circumstances. We can (and you authorize us to) disclose any information about you to law enforcement or other government officials as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate in connection with an investigation into any activity that is illegal or may expose us, or you, to liability.

### Privacy Policy Changes

****We may, from time to time, make changes to this policy, based on your comments and our needs. If we make any substantial changes in the way we use your personal information, we will contact all donors directly, whether in writing, telephonically or via email, and notify all others by posting a prominent announcement on our website.

### Governing Law

You agree that your use of this site, this Privacy policy and any disputes relating thereto, shall be governed in all respects by the laws of the State of New York.

We would like to thank our donors for selecting Acumen to make philanthropic investments, our prospective partners for considering Acumen and our visitors for taking the time to understand more about Acumen by browsing our website. Please contact us at info@acumen.org if you have any questions about our site or our Privacy Policy.
