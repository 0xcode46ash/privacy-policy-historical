# ACOG - Privacy Statement

By accessing or using any of the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (“ACOG”) Internet properties including, without limitation, [www.acog.org](http://www.acog.org/), and any others released by the ACOG from time to time (collectively referred to as the "ACOG Web sites") you agree to comply with and be bound by the ACOG Terms and Conditions of Use ("Terms of Use"). **If you do not agree to this Privacy Policy and the Terms of Use, you must immediately terminate use of the ACOG Web sites.**

**Information Collection and Use** \- Collection, retention, and use of personal information may occur if member and non-member users interact with the ACOG Web sites, by either registering with the site or participating in one of ACOG's services. Member users may be required to provide their name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, ACOG member id number, and/or other identifying information. This information is used to verify status with the ACOG membership database and to respond to inquiries and/or requests. Non-member users may be required to provide an e-mail address, in order for ACOG to respond to inquiries and/or requests. 

ACOG may use e-mail addresses provided by member users to notify them of upcoming events from ACOG and District and Section news and events. Member users are able to opt-out or change their preferences for receiving such information at any time. 

**Use of Cookies and IP Address** \- Cookies are small pieces of information stored by your browser on your computer, which are used to aid in web navigation.  The ACOG Web sites use session cookies. When member users log onto the ACOG Web sites, an identifier is temporarily created and placed in their computer's memory so the member user can access the members-only pages using their e-mail address and password. The cookie contains no personal information and is self-terminated upon exiting the browser. 

A unique number called an IP address identifies each computer on the Internet. Each time users connect to the Internet, their computer is assigned an IP address. When member and non-member users connect to the ACOG Web sites, the IP address is stored for statistical purposes.  This information is used for understanding how users interact with the ACOG Web sites.

**Public Forums** – The ACOG Web sites make public forums and discussion boards available to member users. Please remember that any information disclosed in these areas becomes public information and member users should exercise caution when deciding to disclose personal information. ACOG cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information transmitted in the public forums. 

**External Links** – The ACOG Web sites contain links to other external websites that do not fall under its domain. ACOG is not responsible for the privacy practices and the content of such external websites. 

**Third Party -** ACOG may disclose your personal information if required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to 1) conform to legal requirements or comply with legal process served on ACOG, 2) protect and defend the rights of property of ACOG, or 3) protect the personal safety of ACOG personnel or members of the public in urgent circumstances. 

ACOG reserves the right to amend the Privacy Statement at any time for any reason. This Privacy Statement only applies to information collected by ACOG through the ACOG Web sites.

**Advertisements on our Web site -** Online advertisements on the ACOG Web sites do not collect any personally identifiable information on individual visitors. ACOG does collect nonmedical aggregate data on visitors such as time of day and Web browser type. Such information may be shared with advertisers to determine their advertising effectiveness.

**Children under 13 -** We do not knowingly solicit data online from or market online to children under the age of 13.

**No guarantee -** Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Accordingly, and despite our efforts, ACOG cannot guarantee or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us, or to or from our online products or services.
