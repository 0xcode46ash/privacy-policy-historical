**What Personal Information About You Does RLJE Gather?**

The information we learn from you helps us personalize and continually improve your RLJE experience. Here are the types of information we gather.

**Information You Give Us:** We receive and store any information you enter on our websites or give us in any other way. Examples are when you enter your information while using our services, interact with our customer service, or participate in surveys or marketing promotions. You can choose not to provide certain information, but then you might not be able to take advantage of many of our features. We use the information that you provide for such purposes as responding to your requests, customizing future shopping for you, and communicating with you.  
**Automatic Information:** We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with us. For example, like many websites, we use "cookies" and we obtain certain types of information when your web browser accesses RLJE Sites.  
**Mobile:** When you download or use apps created by RLJE, we may receive information about your location and your mobile device. We may use this information to provide you with location-based services, such as advertising, search results, and other personalized content. Most mobile devices allow you to turn off location services.  
**Social Networking Accounts:** If you choose to connect one or more social networking accounts (such as Facebook) with your RLJE account, we will obtain information from your social networking account.  
**Email Communications:** To help us make emails more useful and interesting, we often receive a confirmation when you open email from RLJE if your computer supports such capabilities. We also compare our customer list to lists received from other companies, in an effort to avoid sending unnecessary messages to our customers. If you do not want to receive email or other mail from us, you may unsubscribe to the email.  
**Information from Other Sources:** We may supplement the information described above with information we obtain from other sources, including from both online and offline data providers. Such supplemental information may include demographic data and Internet browsing behavior. We may use this supplemented information for purposes that are consistent with this Privacy Policy.

**What About Cookies?**

Cookies are small pieces of data sent from our website and stored on your web browser. Your browser sends the cookie back to our server to notify us of your previous activity. It is a mechanism used to remember information (such as items in your shopping cart). The Help feature on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether.

**What Does RLJE Do With the Information It Receives?**

We use the information we collect to provide, analyze, administer, enhance and personalize our services and marketing efforts for you and others. For example, we may use the information we collect for purposes such as:

  


  * determining your general geographic location, providing localized content, providing recommendations on movies and TV shows we think will be enjoyable, determining your Internet service provider and helping us quickly and efficiently respond to inquiries and requests;
  * preventing, detecting and investigating potentially prohibited or illegal activities, including fraud, and enforcing our terms (such as determining free trial eligibility);
  * sending you e-mails, push notifications or other correspondence and advertising concerning our service, including newsletters, messages about new RLJE features, RLJE special offers, promotional announcements and consumer surveys. From time to time, we may partner with companies whose products we believe will interest our members. In conjunction with these partners, we may send promotional announcements and/or serve web-based advertisements on their behalf, as permitted by law.



We may use information on an aggregated or anonymous basis. For example, we use movie and TV show ratings and consumption behavior, as well as commentary and reviews, on an aggregate or anonymous basis, to improve our recommendations to you as well as other users. Aggregated or anonymous information may be used for a variety purposes not explicitly set forth in this policy.

**Does RLJE Share the Information It Receives?**

Information about you is an important part of our business and we are not in the business of selling it to others. We share your information only as described below:

**Service Providers** : We use other companies, agents or contractors ("Service Providers") to perform services on our behalf.

We do not authorize them to use or disclose your personal information except in connection with providing their services.

These websites and platforms have separate and independent privacy statements, notices and terms of use, which we recommend you read carefully. In addition, you may encounter third party applications that interact with RLJE services. RLJE is not responsible for the information handling practices of these other websites and platforms.
