# American Consumer Opinion - Privacy Policy

American Consumer Opinion™ and [www.acop.com](http://www.acop.com/) are owned and operated by [Decision Analyst, Inc](https://web.archive.org/web/20011219153921id_/http%3A//www.acop.com/English/http;/www.decisionanalyst.com)., a leading international marketing research and marketing consulting company in the United States, located in the Dallas-Fort Worth area.

At American Consumer Opinion™, we believe that consumers have an inalienable right to privacy. We protect the privacy and anonymity of our panel members and survey participants by adhering to the [Safe Harbor Privacy Principles](http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/SHPRINCIPLESFINAL.htm) as developed by the U.S. Department of Commerce, in consultation with the European Commission and to the [Children's Online Privacy Protection Rule](http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/edcams/kidzprivacy/) issued by the Federal Trade Commission.

We recognize that some of the information we request from our members is personal and sensitive. These are the steps we take to ensure your privacy. 

**When And Why We Collect Personal Information About You**

We collect information from Registration Forms and from surveys.

**When You Complete The Registration Form:**

  * We use personal information about you, your household, and its members to determine whether you qualify to participate in a particular survey.
  * We use your email address to invite you to complete surveys and to notify you of news regarding the American Consumer Opinion™ Online panel.
  * We use your name and address to send you any prize money or incentives to which you are entitled. 



**When You Complete A Survey:**

  * Additional personal information may also be requested when you participate in surveys. We use this information to determine if you qualify for a particular survey and to analyze the survey results. 
  * We use personal information about survey participants to compile an accurate statistical "picture" of those who took the survey. None of the information collected in surveys is matched to names or addresses. Individual information is always placed into anonymous, statistical summaries that are used in marketing research. [No personal data will ever be linked to an individual's other survey answers.] 



**How We Handle Personal Information**

Private data about you and your household (name, email address, street address, phone number, income, education, family composition, etc.) is strictly confidential and protected at all times.

  * Only a few trusted employees at Decision Analyst, Inc. have access to your personal information, and each has signed a binding confidentiality and non-disclosure agreement. 
  * Your personal information is stored on a secure computer server. Personal identification data is never released to anyone outside of Decision Analyst, Inc. We do not sell, share, or release our members' personal information to others. 



**You Can Opt-Out**

You may "opt-out" of giving personal information at several points:

  * Once you join our panel and receive invitations to complete surveys, you are under no obligation to complete those surveys. You can simply choose not to respond.
  * If you start taking a survey and are asked questions you do not wish to respond to, you may simply stop taking the survey at any point. 



**Access To Your Personal Information**

Your personal information is totally safe and you have complete control over your membership information at all times. 

Once you have registered, you may safely [delete or modify](https://web.archive.org/web/20011219153921id_/http%3A//www.acop.com/English/Registration/Update/default.asp) your membership (and all of your personal data) online at any time.

American Consumer Opinion™ and Decision Analyst, Inc. in compliance with the [ Children's Online Privacy Protection Act](http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/edcams/kidzprivacy/) , does not accept registrations from children under 12 year of age. We do not directly advertise or market to children.

From time to time we may have a survey available for children. Any children 12 and under will not directly be contact by us. For these surveys we will contact the parents who are members of the panel and ask them to give consent for the child to complete the screener or survey.
