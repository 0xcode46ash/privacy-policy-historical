We collect information from you during the registration process and during the survey process. 

  * During our registration process, we collect your name, address, email address, and the names, date of birth, and gender of those in your household. We also collect the IP address of the computer you used at the time you registered and confirmed your registration.
  * We also gather information on your household–such as dwelling type, education level, gender, income, marital status, ethnicity, occupation, your Internet speed, and computer capabilities–to help us prescreen members for certain surveys.
  * Additional information may also be requested when you participate in surveys, such as your preferences, shopping patterns, and buying behavior. This information is used to prescreen members for subsequent surveys and you may be invited to take additional surveys based upon your previous survey answers. For example, a client may want to do a survey of women aged 18 to 55 who do not shop in a mall. We would send a short screening survey to determine which panel members meet our client's requirements.
  * None of the information collected in surveys is reported by the names or addresses of members. Your individual information is always placed into anonymous, statistical summaries that are used in marketing research. No one outside of Decision Analyst will ever know how you personally answered any of the questions in our surveys.

  * We use information about you, your household, and its members to determine whether you qualify to participate in a particular survey.
  * We use your email address to invite you to complete surveys and to notify you of news regarding the American Consumer Opinion® Online panel.
  * We use your name and address to send you any prize money or incentives to which you are entitled.
  * We use personal information gathered during surveys to analyze the survey results. For example, we might look at the answers of women compared to men, or the answers of young people compared to older people, or high-income groups compared to low-income groups.
  * We use your personal information to verify you are who you say you are and live where you say you live. Any evidence of false or dishonest information will result in the permanent loss of your membership.
  * We may use your contact information, such as email address, registration data, and IP address to verify the opt-in nature of our email list when asked to do so by an Internet service provider.



Back to top

  * Your answers to our surveys are grouped with the answers of other people and reported to our clients as statistical summaries.
  * None of your answers to surveys are ever reported in conjunction with your personal information. No one outside of Decision Analyst will ever know how you personally answered any of the questions in our surveys.
  * We don’t share your personal information with any third parties–no client, no business partner, or other organization. **American Consumer Opinion® does not sell or rent your personal information to anyone.**
  * We may contract with an email service provider to help us send email invitations to surveys. In such cases, we will have a nondisclosure agreement with the email service provider to ensure your contact information is protected and is not misused.

You may "opt out" of giving personal information at anytime when taking a survey. You may also [update or delete](https://acop.com/AcopApps/RegistrationUtilities/Login.aspx?L=1&PID=) your personal information at any time. 

  * Once you join our panel and receive invitations to complete surveys, you are under no obligation to complete those surveys. You can simply choose not to respond.
  * If you start taking a survey and are asked questions you do not wish to respond to, you may simply stop taking the survey at any point.
  * Once you have registered, you may safely [update or delete](https://acop.com/AcopApps/RegistrationUtilities/Login.aspx?L=1&PID=) your membership (and all of your personal data) online at any time.
