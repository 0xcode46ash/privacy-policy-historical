---|---  
  
AC Lens collects information about its customers both during the order process and as customers navigate the http://www.aclens.com/ web site. The information provided by customers during the ordering process such as their name, physical address, email address, and payment information is considered private, and AC Lens will not sell this personal information to third parties. This information will be used to process your order and deliver it to you in a timely fashion. In addition, AC Lens reserves the right to contact existing customers regarding store specials and other significant events. Information submitted to the "Ask the Doctor" area will be used to respond to your questions and/or concerns and will not be used for promotional purposes.

Opt-Out Provided   
AC Lens will provide existing customers with the opportunity to "opt-out" or choose to be removed from future mailings from AC Lens. Opt-out information will be included with any non-personal or non-essential message sent to prior customers. You may also Opt-Out by sending an email to [service@aclens.com](mailto:service@aclens.com) requesting that you be removed from certain types of future mailings or calling 1-888-248-5367. A personal or essential message is one that would relate directly to the particular customer's order.

Non-Personal Information   
AC Lens also routinely collects statistics on site usage patterns through web logs, web beacons and third party service providers. These statistics are not intended to relate to any particular individual. Instead, they are used internally to judge the effectiveness of web site features and content. Some real-time information is occasionally used to automatically suggest a product to a customer based on that customer's observed preferences.

Third Party Service Providers   
AC Lens may share your information provided with your order with third-party service providers who provide services related to your order. Examples of these third-party service providers include a credit card processing company, a contact lens supplier, or a shipping service. Your personal information will not be used by any third party for purposes other than providing these services in relation to your order.

Prescription Verification   
AC Lens may verify your prescription information provided with your order with your doctor or eyecare provider as required by Federal Law. For more information about how your Personal Health Information is protected, please see our [Notice of Privacy Practices](https://web.archive.org/web/20081217125944id_/http%3A//www.aclens.com/npp.asp).

Legal Disclosure of Your Information  
We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our Web site.

Contests and Drawings   
AC Lens may sponsor or host contests or drawings from time to time. Some contests may be offered in conjunction with a third party sponsor and website users will be notified at the time of the contest as to whether a third party sponsor is involved and whether the third party will be receiving the user's information to send promotional communications. The website user can then choose whether to enter the contest or not at that time based on the terms and conditions associated with that particular contest.

Transaction Security  
All transactions occur through our Secure Server, protected by a VerisignÂ® Secure Site Certificate. That means that we use encryption to secure information sent from your computer to our servers. In addition, credit card numbers and other sensitive information is encrypted in our database(s) to provide a second layer of security for your private information.

Updating Your Information  
If you ever need to update any information on file with AC Lens, you may call or email us at AC Lens at [service@aclens.com](mailto:service@aclens.com). If you need to update your information when re-ordering, you will have a chance to make changes to your payment information, shipping and billing address(es) at checkout.

If you have additional questions about the privacy of your information, please contact AC Lens at [service@aclens.com](mailto:service@aclens.com) or call us at 1-888-248-5367.
