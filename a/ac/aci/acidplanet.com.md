Privacy Policy Statement

[](http://www.the-dma.org/dmalogotext.html)

**Notice**

This privacy policy statement ("Privacy Policy") applies to www.sonymediasoftware.com, acidplanet.com, any other site that Madison Media Software, Inc., a subsidiary of Sony Corporation of America ("Sony Media Software") owns and operates, and all Sony Media Software software products. This Privacy Policy is intended to provide you notice of our information management practices, including the types of information gathered, how it is used and safeguarded, and the degree to which you may control the maintenance and sharing of your information. Your use of any of our Web sites or services constitutes acceptance of this Privacy Policy and the [Terms of Service](https://web.archive.org/corporate/terms.asp), which is hereby incorporated by reference.

**Collection of Information**

Sony Media Software only collects personally identifiable information (such as name, e-mail address, mailing address, telephone number) about you when you specifically provide this information on a voluntary basis. For example, we might ask for such information when we run a contest, when you register for subscription services, during product registration, in our online stores, and in connection with content submissions, community postings (e.g., chat and bulletin boards), surveys, and voting and polling activities. We will make reasonable efforts to ensure that whatever information you provide will be maintained in a secure environment. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you transmit to us or from our products or services, and you provide such information at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission, we make our best effort to ensure its security on our systems. When credit card information is transmitted we use industry standard SSL (secure socket layer) encryption.

You should be very cautious when you voluntarily disclose personal information (for example, name or e-mail address) on bulletin boards, in chat areas, or the upload areas of any Sony Media Software site. That information, along with any other information you may disclose in your posting, can be collected, correlated, and used by third parties, and may result in unsolicited messages from other posters or third parties. Such activities are beyond the control of Sony Media Software and are not subject to this Privacy Policy.

Also, you should be aware that Sony Media Software may sometimes permit third parties to offer subscription and/or registration-based services on a Sony Media Software site. Sony Media Software is not responsible for any actions or policies of such third parties, and you should check the applicable privacy policy of any third party whenever you provide personally identifiable information.

Sony Media Software collects IP addresses for system administration, record keeping, and advertising reporting. Your IP address is automatically assigned to your computer when you use the World Wide Web. Sony Media Software's servers record incoming IP addresses. Your IP address may be stored with your registration, order, or other information you submit via forms on our website. By tracking IP addresses, we can determine which sites refer the most people to Sony Media Software. (Think of an IP address like your zip code; it tells us in general terms where you're from.)

**Special Notice to Parents Regarding Children Under 13**

Sony Media Software recognizes the sensitivity of personally identifiable information concerning children under the age of 13. We are committed to complying with all applicable laws and regulations regarding children, including the including the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act. We do not intend to collect personally identifiable information from anyone under 13 and will not knowingly collect, maintain, or disclose such information. If you are under 13, you should not enter any personally identifiable information about yourself on any of our web sites or in any of our products. If you are a parent or guardian who has discovered that your child under the age of 13 has submitted his or her personally identifiable information without your permission or consent, we will make reasonable efforts to remove the information from our database, at your request. To request the removal of your child's information, please send us [an e-mail](https://web.archive.org/corporate/contact.asp?id=12) and be sure to include in your message the same User Name and/or e-mail address and password that your child submitted.

**Information Sharing and Disclosure**

Sony Media Software may disclose personally identifiable information about you to a subsequent owner or operator of one of our Web sites or services if we assign our rights and obligations regarding any of your information at the time of a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or substantially all of a Web site's assets and/or services to a subsequent owner or operator. You will be deemed to have consented to the disclosure to, and use by, a subsequent owner or operator of such Web site or service, and your continued use of the site or service signifies your agreement to be bound by the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy of the site's or service's subsequent owner or operator.

Sony Media Software may also retain an outside company to manage a database containing certain customer information to create and distribute mailings or e-mail offerings by Sony Media Software. In those situations, the outside party is performing work for us. Sony Media Software takes appropriate steps designed to ensure your information is used only to provide the promotion or services requested.

However, even if you opt out of receiving any communications from Sony Media Software, we reserve the right to contact you regarding your account status, technical support, product information, changes to the subscriber agreement, and any other matter that might affect our service to you and/or our records on you and/or any products you purchased from us.

Sony Media Software may also disclose personally identifiable information to third parties in the following instances: 1) we have been given your consent to disclose; 2) we have previously informed you of the disclosure, including by means of our Privacy Policy; 3) we are required by law or court order to disclose, or we believe in good faith that the law requires it; 4) disclosure is necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal action against, someone who may cause or be causing harm to, or interference with, our rights or property, other Sony Media Software Web site users, or anyone else; or 5) to respond to an inquiry, request or complaint that you have made. We may also use IP addresses in cooperation with Internet service providers to identify users if we deem it necessary to comply with laws, to enforce compliance with this Privacy Policy or our Terms of Service, or to protect our sites, customers, or others.

**Information Use**

Sony Media Software may use your personally identifiable information to send you promotional and/or marketing information about related products, services and offerings from us, unless you indicate you would like to "opt out" of receiving such materials. You can opt out at anytime on the [Sony Media Software email preferences page](https://web.archive.org/myaccount/remove.asp). Sony Media Software reserves the right to perform statistical analyses of user behavior and characteristics, either internally or by sending this data to a third party for further analysis. We do this in order to measure interest in and use of the various areas of our Web sites and to create tailored marketing offerings. We may share this information with advertisers in aggregated, anonymous form. We may also use this aggregated, anonymous information to let advertisers know how many visitors have seen their banners and how many have clicked on them; advertisers will not be able to identify any individual from these analyses.

**Cookies**

You should be aware that non-personally identifiable information and data may be automatically collected through the standard operation of Sony Media Software's Internet servers or through the use of "cookies." "Cookies" are small text files a Web site can use to recognize repeat users. Sony Media Software uses cookies to recognize visitors and more quickly provide personalized content or grant you unimpeded access to registered areas of our Web sites. With cookies enabled, you may not need to fill in password or contact information, should areas of our sites ask for this information.

Information gathered through cookies also helps us measure use of our sites. Cookie data allows us to track usage behavior and compile data that we can use to improve the site and target advertising. This data will be used in aggregate form; no specific users will be tracked.

Sony Media Software does not use cookies to uniquely identify you, except where such use helps us to make your visit more efficient. For example, cookies will help us identify you when you order, so that you don't have to fill in your billing and shipping information every time you visit a Sony Media Software store. By enabling cookies, you will not have to fill in your personal information every time you post a song to acidplanet.com. Cookies help you travel through our sites efficiently.

Generally, cookies work by assigning a unique number to the user that has no meaning outside of the Web site that he or she is visiting. Sometimes, advertisers or third parties hosting data for Sony Media Software will issue cookies. Sony Media Software cannot control the use of these cookies or the information that they gather.

You can easily turn off cookies. Most browsers have a feature that allows the user to refuse cookies or issues a warning when cookies are being sent. Remember, though, cookies may be necessary to provide you with certain features available on Sony Media Software's sites. Some areas of our sites may not function properly without cookies. Enabling cookies ensures a smooth, efficient visit to our sites.

**Other Data Requirements**

Some Sony Media Software applications generate a Computer ID value during the installation process. This is a number that serves to identify your computer for licensing purposes only and contains no specific information about you, your computer, or any files or other data on your system. Computer ID values serve as an effective way to combat software piracy.

**Opting Out**

Upon request, Sony Media Software will allow any user to opt out of further promotional contacts at any time. Additionally upon request, we will use reasonable efforts to allow you to update or correct personally identifiable information to the extent that changing the data will not compromise privacy or security interests. Also, upon your request, we will use commercially reasonable efforts to functionally delete your personally identifiable information from our database; however, it may be impossible to delete all of your information without some residual data because of backups and records of deletions. Furthermore, your e-mail address will be added to a suppression list that stops any message directed to you before it leaves Sony Media Software. It is your responsibility, however, to make certain that we have your most current e-mail address.

Should you wish to opt out of any mailing from Sony Media Software, please contact [Sony Media Software list maintenance](https://web.archive.org/corporate/contact.asp?id=11).

You may arrive at one of these sites through clicking on a banner advertisement, as part of a co-branding arrangement, or simply by selecting a link on a Sony Media Software web page. These sites might issue their own cookies or collect data or personally identifiable information. Use caution when visiting an external site.
