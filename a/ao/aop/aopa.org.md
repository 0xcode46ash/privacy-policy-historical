# AOPA Online: Privacy Policy Statement

## AOPA Privacy Policy Statement

**The Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association is committed to maintaining your privacy and providing you with options regarding the use of your personal information.** If you ever have a question about our privacy policy or the personal information we may have on file and how we use it, please contact us at 800/USA-AOPA (872-2672), Monday through Friday, from 8:30 a.m. to 6 p.m. Eastern, or e-mail [memberassistance@aopa.org](mailto:memberassistance@aopa.org).

#### Information collected from visitors using the public areas of our Web site

AOPA does not collect any personal information from visitors browsing our Web site unless they voluntarily submit it through one of our forms requesting information or enrolling in a program. Only aggregate data—such as the number of hits per page—are collected. We can see the IP address and in some cases your provider’s host name, but none of this data provides any personal information that tells us your identity.

#### Information collected from members who have registered for access to our members-only content

To gain access to the members-only areas of AOPA’s Web site, members are asked to register and provide some personal information. For members who have accepted a “cookie” or who have logged in to our site with their username and password for a single session, we are able to see the time and date you visited, the IP address, type of browser (e.g., Internet Explorer), and what pages you viewed on our site. This information is not disclosed outside of AOPA or the Air Safety Foundation and is utilized only to improve our Web site, determine what new content might be popular or valuable to our members, and to improve your browsing experience in the future.

#### Credit card account information

AOPA does not disclose credit card account information that you may voluntarily provide to us during transactions by phone or through our secure Web site to anyone other than the credit card company that validates the charge for processing purposes. We also encourage our members not to use e-mail to communicate credit card information for their own personal security and privacy.

#### The way we use information

In addition to the uses outlined above, we use information you voluntarily provided for the purpose you intended, such as to complete registrations, renewals, or any other transaction that you requested through one of the forms on our Web site.

If you utilize our Web site to submit any personal medical data, it is only used to complete the transaction you have requested and is not shared with anyone or any company.

We may use members’ names, postal addresses, phone numbers and e-mail addresses to communicate product and service offers or important legislative or informational updates that we think may be of interest to you. AOPA does not sell or rent our members’ personal information, addresses, e-mail addresses, or phone numbers. 

AOPA does share _limited_ information such as mailing address and phone numbers with the Air Safety Foundation and our AOPA Certified Partners who offer valuable services to our members (e.g., Bank of America, the AOPA Insurance Agency, Sporty’s). All of our Certified Partners are legally and contractually obligated not to sell, rent, or share our members’ information with any other companies or partners. And the only authorized use of our members’ address or phone information is in regards to offers directly related to the service they are providing to AOPA. They may not contact you for any other reason or without AOPA’s knowledge. AOPA, the Air Safety Foundation and our Certified Partners also occasionally contract telemarketing firms to make calls on our behalf about our products and services, however those companies are also legally and contractually obligated to only use our members’ phone numbers for the specific AOPA-related or Air Safety Foundation campaign that they have been hired to execute.

You may request at any time to have your name, address, phone number, or e-mail address excluded from our any type of communications. You can request that we only contact you through one of those methods of communication, or even specify what types of contacts you do not desire: 

  * No mail, e-mail, or phone calls from AOPA 
  * No mail, e-mail, or phone calls from Air Safety Foundation 
  * No mail, e-mail, or phone calls from our Certified Partners



Just contact us to let us know your preferences. 

#### Visits made to other Web sites from links or advertising on www.aopa.org

Although AOPA’s site includes links and advertising to other Internet sites, AOPA takes no responsibility for the content or information contained on those sites.

AOPA provides these links and advertisements as a benefit and service of to our members, but we have no control over those sites. Other sites that you visit may have their own distinct privacy policies or no policy at all. They may use personal information that you may provide them differently than our policy permits. AOPA strongly encourages you to review the privacy policies of any site before providing any personal information to them.

This policy is effective February 26, 2008. If our privacy practices change at any time in the future, we will post the policy changes to this page to notify you of these changes and provide you with the ability to opt out of these new uses of collected personal data.
