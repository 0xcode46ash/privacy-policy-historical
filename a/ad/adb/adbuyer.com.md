# Privacy Policy

BY USING THE AdBuyer.COM WEB SITE (the "Site") OR REGISTERING FOR OR ACCESSING ANY OF THE SERVICES PROVIDED BY SOOTH SOFTWARE CORPORATION, INC. (“AdBuyer” or “we” or “us”), YOU ARE AGREEING TO THE TERMS OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY. IF YOU DO NOT WISH TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY, PLEASE DO NOT USE THIS SITE OR REGISTER FOR ANY OF THE ADBUYER SERVICES. Please feel free to contact us at [ accounts@AdBuyer.com](mailto:accounts@AdBuyer.com) if you have any questions or concerns regarding this Privacy Policy.

  


Introduction

AdBuyer respects the privacy of visitors to its Site. This privacy policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, who we might share this information with, and how to access, opt out of, or change your information. This policy may change as we develop and expand our services, so please check the Site frequently for changes to this privacy policy.

  


Collection and Use of Personally Identifiable Information

You are welcome to visit portions of the Site without becoming a registered user or revealing any personally identifiable information (PII). We may ask for PII, such as your name, address or email address, when you register for certain AdBuyer services that require registration and a password. We will use your PII to provide you with the service(s) you have registered for. If you register for one of our premium services, you will be required to submit your credit card and other information directly to PayPal. AdBuyer will not have access to this information. You may review PayPal’s privacy policy by visiting their web site at [www.paypal.com](http://www.paypal.com/). If you provide PII to make an inquiry about our products or services, we will use that PII to respond to your inquiry. Similarly, if you are an existing customer with questions, concerns or technical support questions, we will use your PII to respond to such questions and concerns. If you have registered for one of the AdBuyer services, we will send you emails on a daily or weekly basis (depending on which service you register for) containing bid recommendations to better help you utilize our service(s). In addition, we may send you emails describing our then-existing services or notifying you of enhancements or new services we are providing. To opt-out of such emails, you may email us at [accounts@AdBuyer.com](mailto:accounts@AdBuyer.com). We store PII on our servers in the United States. Such information is usually deleted as space requires or in the normal course of business. To update your information, please send an email to [ accounts@AdBuyer.com](mailto:accounts@AdBuyer.com). 

  


Collection and Use of Non Personal Information

Our web servers uses "cookies" to collect general information about your computer (such as which web browser you are using) and to facilitate your use of the Site. A “cookie” is a small piece of data that is transmitted to an end-user’s computer and stored in the cookie directory of that user’s hard drive. A cookie identifies an end-user as a unique, anonymous user (but does not collect or transmit any personally identifiable information about that end-user). AdBuyer uses cookies and IP addresses to authenticate and keep track of user sessions. As an end-user, you can generally configure your browser to accept all cookies, reject all cookies, or notify you when a cookie is set. (Each browser is different, so check the “Help” menu of your browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences). Please note that if you reject all cookies, you may limit the services we can provide when you visit. AdBuyer uses cookies to collect information about use of the Site for our own general business purposes, such as which sections are visited most frequently, how many visitors we have received, and how long visitors stay on each page. 

  


Disclosure of Information to Third Parties.

AdBuyer may share information that is not personally identifiable about you in the aggregate with business partners, sponsors, investors and other third parties. For example, we may disclose how many keyword bids we change on a daily basis or how many subscribers we have in a certain industry. We will not share any PII we may collect about you with any third party without your express consent unless we are required to do so in order to comply with any valid legal process such as a search warrant, subpoena, statute, or court order, or if we have a good faith belief we are required to do so to protect our rights, safety or property. 

  


Security.

AdBuyer has implemented commercially reasonable security measures in order to protect both personal and non-personal information from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration or destruction. 

  


Changes in Corporate Structure

If all or part of AdBuyer is sold, merged or otherwise transferred to another entity, the information that you have provided at the Site or in connection with the AdBuyer services may be transferred as part of that transaction. However, AdBuyer will take commercially reasonable steps to ensure that such information is used in a manner consistent with the AdBuyer privacy policy under which it was collected.   
Changes to the Privacy Policy and your Consent

  


AdBuyer may decide to change this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we will post those changes on this page so that you are always aware of the information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances we disclose it. By using our services directly or indirectly, you consent to the collection and use of your information as outlined in this Privacy Policy.
