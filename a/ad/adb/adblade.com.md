# Adblade – Online Advertising and Monetization Services

**  
Overview**

Adblade.com and its network of owned and partnered facebook applications ("Adblade") places importance on the privacy of our clients and their businesses. We adhere to the policies regarding privacy and security outlined below. If you have any questions, comments or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact us at [privacy@Adblade.com](mailto:privacy@adblade.com). Please familiarize yourself with the below sections that are applicable to you. 

**Ad Serving**

Adblade partners with numerous companies to provide online advertisements to "End Users" which are human users of Facebook.com and various websites on the internet. As an End User browses the web, he or she may visit web-pages that include references to Adblade's advertising service. When this happens, an End User's browser may request advertisements from Adblade's system.   
When Adblade receives these requests, we may record information about this interaction (as well as any further interaction with our advertisements such as clicks, mouse movements, etc.) including the End User's IP address and time of request, information about the general geographical location from which an End User is viewing an advertisement, Information passed from a Facebook application through Facebook's open API and other information made available by the browser.

  
Additionally, Adblade employs small text files stored on your web browser (otherwise known as cookies) for the purpose of better tailoring advertisements to an End User's preferences over time. These cookies may include a unique anonymous identifier along with information about the particular types of content in which the End User has shown interest. 

On occasion, partner sites, vendors or internally run surveys may provide us with additional information about End Users. In these situations, all information is kept entirely anonymous and does not include any type of personally identifiable information. Adblade only accepts this information from organizations with clearly available and visible privacy policies. 

Adblade does not sell information it collects about End Users. However, Adblade may share data about aggregate usage statistics with the public or other businesses with whom we work. 

Because Adblade takes privacy seriously, End Users can opt out of being identified individually on our network. If an End User chooses to opt out of individual identification within the Adblade network, Adblade will set a small cookie for the sole purpose ensuring that such End User is no longer tracked individually. This cookie will last for one year as long as the End User does not delete cookies or change computers.  If an End User deletes its cookies after opting out, he or she will need to opt out again by clicking the link in this paragraph. End Users also have the option, at any time, to set their browser to not accept cookies from Adblade. In these situations Adblade's system will still provide advertisements to the End User. Please note, however, that these advertisements may be less relevant to such End User's interests. 

The capture, storage and analysis of information are solely for the purposes of ensuring a positive End User experience, eliminating fraudulent activity, and system administration. 

**Adblade Advertisers**

If an advertiser chooses to sign-up to Adblade's Facebook advertising network, they are explicitly agreeing to the use of information they provide as described below. The nature of this technology means that advertisers who do not agree with this policy cannot use Adblade's Facebook advertising network, advertising interface or measurement tools.  The Terms and Conditions that they agree to during registration allow Adblade to update the terms of this privacy policy at any time and without notice.

Personal information provided by an advertiser will be combined with information about its purchasing patterns of Adblade's products and services, its use of Adblade's Facebook API, performance of its advertisements, and all other information provided by the advertiser. This information will be used to improve the applications provided to advertisers, improve the relevancy of ad results and any other use deemed helpful to the Adblade enterprise. Adblade regularly shares this information with key partners on an individual basis. Furthermore, Adblade and its partners may use this information to contact the advertiser about additional products and services.   
An advertiser has the right to terminate their relationship with Adblade in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in the advertiser's contract with Adblade. However, all information captured about the advertiser will remain the property of Adblade indefinitely.

**Organizations We Work With**

Adblade provides access to organizations we work with on Adblade's Facebook advertising network to manage their own advertising networks. Those relationships are managed under contracts between Adblade and the respective partners. The campaign management tools which Adblade provides to many of its partners allow each such partner to view all relevant information of Adblade's Facebook advertisers whose ads are being displayed on that partner's site. Such information includes bidding data, spend data, topics and placements viewed and purchased, and the advertiser's contact information. 

**Conclusion**

Adblade works hard to respect the privacy of its users. Unless required otherwise by applicable law or legal process, Adblade will operate entirely within the policies described above.
