**WHAT INFORMATION WE COLLECT AND WHY**

Maydream provides a business-to-business service. We only collect personal information from users when it is related to their professional activity. 

###  1\. Registration

To access certain areas of the AdForum.com website (especially creative work), you must first complete a registration form to become either member (and access to Agency Preview’s agency portfolio’s for free) or subscriber (and get a full access to AdFolio for a fee). During registration, you may be required to provide professional contact information, such as name, email address and company type, to provide mailing address and payment information, and to choose a password. Your email is your login. We send all new registered members and subscribers a welcoming email to verify their password and username. When an email address is not working, the associated password might be deactivated by Maydream. 

###  2\. Subscription to the Newsletter

Should a user wish to receive our newsletter, we require them to provide professional contact information, such as name, company type and email address. Our newsletters are usually distributed via email. 

###  3\. Registration of a company in our database

Agencies, productions companies and other businesses may add themselves to AdForum.com directories. During the online process that allows them to do so, the personal information of the user who inputs the data is requested: name, email and phone number. An AdForum.com Information Center member may use this information to contact this person for verification purposes.  
If the company decides to buy an upgraded listing in our directory, see also buyer information collection below. 

###  4\. Buyer information collection

When buying a service on the site, users are asked for contact, billing and shipping information. These data may be used to process the order, to get the payment through the credit card company, to personalize the product(s) and/or the service(s) according to the order, and to ship the item(s) related to the ordered service, like questionnaires. If there is a problem with the order, a Maydream Representative may contact the user by email, phone, fax or mail. A confirmation email is sent for each online purchase. 

###  5\. Request for information

When requesting information from AdForum.com (sales brochure, price list, press kit, service demo by phone, etc.), users must first complete a registration form. During registration, a user may be required to provide professional contact information, such as name, company, company address, phone number, email address, and company type. This information is used to deliver the information the user has requested. 

###  6\. Surveys and Contests

From time to time, we request information from AdForum.com users via surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary. Information requested may include contact information and business information (name, company, occupation, responsibilities, email and shipping address). This information is mainly used to better understand our audience and to send prizes to the winners when needed. Should the results of a contest or a survey be published, no personal information will be divulged. 

###  7\. Prospect information collection

To use our “Refer/Send to a friend” services, users are requested to provide names and email addresses that may be used later as prospect information. For these “Refer/Send to a friend” services, AdForum.com sends an email to a prospect (or prospects) on behalf of the user containing links to the information the user has selected on the AdForum.com website. Each of these emails provides the prospect with the opportunity to opt-out of further communication from AdForum.com. 

###  1\. AdForum.com's newsletters and e-alerts

AdForum subscribes for free the users of its website who submit their email address for any of the purposes listed above to its newsletters and e-alerts.

###  2\. General communication from Maydream

Users and prospects will occasionally receive information on products, services and special deals from Maydream, regarding AdForum.com or another site published by Maydream. No other company but Maydream will ever access the user and prospect personal information. Out of respect for the privacy of our users, we present the option not to receive these types of communications. Please see our opt-out policy below. 

###  3\. Opt-out

Our users are given the opportunity to "opt-out" of having their personal information used for marketing purposes not directly related to out site.   
Users who no longer wish to receive our newsletters, e-alerts or promotional materials may opt-out by:

\- Replying to the email message with the word UNSUBSCRIBE in the subject line   
\- Sending an email to unsubscribe@adforum.com from the address they want to unsubscribe   
\- Sending a letter to MayDream, Information Center, 70 Hudson Street, Office 4B, Hoboken, NJ 07030, USA   
When the user makes an “unsubscribe” request we commit to remove the email address from our mailing lists as soon as possible, and usually before the next mailing.
