INFORMATION COLLECTION  
Maydream provides business-to-business services only. Personal information collected from users of the AdForum.com web site is strictly related to the professional activity of the user.  
1\. Registration

In order to access certain areas of the AdForum.com website and especially to access creative work, users must first complete a registration form to become members. During registration, a user may be required to provide professional contact information, such as name, email address and company type, and to choose a login and a password. We send all new registered members a welcoming email to verify password and username.  
  
2\. Subscription to the Newsletter

Should a user wish to receive our newsletter, we require them to provide professional contact information, such as name, company type and email address. Our newsletters are usually distributed via email.  
  
3\. Registration of a company in our database

Agencies, productions companies and other businesses may add themselves to AdForum.com directories. During the online process that allows them to do so, the personal information of the user who inputs the data is requested: name, email and phone number. An AdForum.com Information Center member may use this information to contact this person for verification purposes.  
If the company decides to buy an upgraded listing in our directory, see also buyer information collection below.   
  
4\. Buyer information collection

When buying a service on the site, users are asked for contact, billing and shipping information. These data may be used to process the order, to get the payment through the credit card company, to personalize the product(s) and/or the service(s) according to the order, and to ship the item(s) related to the ordered service, like questionnaires. If there is a problem with the order, an Maydream Representative may contact the user by email, phone, fax or mail. A confirmation email is sent for each online purchase.  
  
5\. Request for information

When requesting information from AdForum.com (sales brochure, price list, press kit, service demo by phone, etc.), users must first complete a registration form. During registration, a user may be required to provide professional contact information, such as name, company, company address, phone number, email address, and company type. This information is used to deliver the information the user has requested.  
  
6\. Surveys and Contests

From time to time, we request information from AdForum.com users via surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary. Information requested may include contact information and business information (name, company, occupation, responsibilities, email and shipping address). This information is mainly used to better understand our audience and to send prizes to the winners when needed. Should the results of a contest or a survey be published, no personal information will be divulged.  
  
7\. Prospect information collection

To use our “Refer/Send to a friend” services, users are requested to provide names and email addresses that may be used later as prospect information. For these “Refer/Send to a friend” services, AdForum.com sends an email to a prospect (or prospects) on behalf of the user containing links to the information the user has selected on the AdForum.com website. Each of these emails provides the prospect with the opportunity to opt-out of further communication from AdForum.com.

Out of respect for the privacy of our users, we present the option not to receive these types of communications. Please see our opt-out policy below.  
  
2\. Choice / Opt-out

Our users are given the opportunity to "opt-out" of having their personal information used for marketing purposes not directly related to out site.
