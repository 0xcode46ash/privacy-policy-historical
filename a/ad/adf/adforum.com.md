**Information Collection**

Maydream provides business-to-business services only. Personal information collected from users of the AdForum.com web site is strictly related to the professional activity of the user.

**Registration**

In order to access certain areas of the AdForum.com website, users must first complete a registration form. During registration, a user may be required to provide professional contact information, such as name, email address, and company type.

**Sharing of Information**

Maydream is the sole owner of information collected on the AdForum.com web site. We will not sell, disclose, or rent this information to others except: (a) to Maydream partners, affiliates, and subsidiaries for purposes related to customer service and the marketing of services and products offered by Maydream, Maydream's partners and affiliates; (b) if such disclosure is made pursuant to a legal proceeding or is required by law. Maydream carefully reviews the privacy policies of partners, affiliates and subsidiaries to ensure that they reflect the same attention and commitment to privacy as Maydream.  
We may share aggregated information with our partners and advertisers. However, this information is not linked to any personally identifiable information.  
If you DO NOT wish to be included in marketing efforts that involve Maydream or Maydream's partners or affiliates, you may OPT-OUT by sending an email to [info@adforum.com](mailto:info@adforum.com). We also offer an opt-out option with our first marketing correspondence with users.

**Communication from Maydream**

We send all new users a welcoming email to verify password and username. Established users will occasionally receive information on products, services, special deals, and a newsletter. Out of respect for the privacy of our users, we present the option not to receive these types of communications. Please see our opt-out policy below.   
Should a user wish to receive our newsletter, we require them to provide professional contact information, such as name, company and email address.

**Choice/Opt-Out**

Our users are given the opportunity to "opt-out" of having their personal information used for marketing purposes not directly related to out site. We offer this "opt-out" option at the point at which information is collected. For example, when you register for your free login and password, you may choose NOT to receive materials from AdForum.com or our partners and affiliates.  
Users who no longer wish to receive our newsletter or promotional materials may opt-out by replying to the email message with the word UNSUBSCRIBE in the subject line, by sending an email to [info@adforum.com](mailto:info@adforum.com), or by sending a letter to Maydream, Information Center, 5 Marine View Plaza, Suite 402, Hoboken, NJ 07030, USA.

**Surveys and Contests**

From time to time, we request information from AdForum.com website users via surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary. Information requested may include contact information (name and shipping address) and business information (company and billings).

**Outside Data**

From time to time, for marketing purposes, Maydream may combine information disclosed by a user on the AdForum.com site with information about that user obtained from other sources.

**Log Files**

We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track user movements and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information.

**Cookies**

AdForum.com's website uses cookies. A [cookie](http://webopedia.internet.com/TERM/c/cookie.html) is a message given to a web browser by a web server. This message is then sent back to the server each time the browser requests a page from the server.  
Cookies on the AdForum.com site are used to make the login process easier for our users and to track broad user movements for statistical purposes.  
[Real Media](http://www.realmedia.com/), our digital advertising service, also uses cookies to collect information from our users. Click [here](http://www.realmedia.com/privacy.html) to review Real Media's privacy policy.

**Correcting/Updating Personal Information**

We provide a way to correct, update or remove user personal data from our records should information change, or if a user no longer desires to be on our mailing list.  
When you make a deletion request we commit to remove your information from our mailing list within 3 business days.  
This delay of 3 days also applies to corrections and updates of personal information as Maydream attempts to verify the identity of a user requesting such changes to their information before they are made.  
Because we use backup storage, any information you give to us may remain in our backup records for some period of time after your deletion request.  
To correct, update or remove personal information, send an email to our Customer Support Department at [info@adforum.com](mailto:info@adforum.com) or send a letter to Maydream, Information Center, 5 Marine View Plaza, Suite 402, Hoboken, NJ 07030, USA.

**Accessing Your Information**

To review your personal or business information held by Maydream, please address an email to this effect to [info@adforum.com](mailto:info@adforum.com), or write to Maydream, Information Center, 5 Marine View Plaza, Suite 402, Hoboken, NJ 07030, USA. We will take steps to verify the identity of anyone making such a request before such disclosure is made.

**Security**

Maydream takes every precaution to protect our users' information. When users submit information via our website, their information is protected both online and offline. All employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. Each quarter, as well as any time new policies are added, we remind our employees about the importance placed on privacy and our procedures for ensuring that customer information is protected.  
Only Maydream employees who need personally identifiable user information to perform a specific job are granted access to that information.  
The servers on which we store personally identifiable information are kept in a secure environment.

**Credit Card Information**

When you submit your credit card information on our site, this information is processed on a secure server using Secure Socket Layer Protocol with 128 bit encryption.  
We do not retain credit card information online. When such information is offline, it is kept in a secure environment accessible only to the Maydream employees that need such information to perform their jobs.  
At Maydream, we pay close attention to advances in Internet security technology and endeavor to implement new security methods when they are practical and appropriate.

**Other Privacy Issues**

**Links**

This website contains links to other websites. Please be aware that Maydream is not responsible for the privacy practices of other such sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information.

**Notification of Changes**

This Privacy Policy was last updated on February 13, 2001. When we change our Privacy Policy, we will post a message on our homepage to that effect with a link to the revised Policy. In this way, users will always be aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under which circumstances we may disclose it. If at any point we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify users by way of email and users will be given a choice as to whether or not Maydream may use their information in this different manner.
