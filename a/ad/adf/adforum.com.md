**WHAT INFORMATION WE COLLECT AND WHY**

Maydream provides a business-to-business service. We only collect personal information from users when it is related to their professional activity. We collect personally identifiable information, like names, postal addresses, email addresses, etc., when voluntarily submitted by our visitors. The information you provide is used to fulfill you specific request. This information is only used to fulfill your specific request, unless you give us permission to use it in another manner, for example to add you to one of our mailing lists. 

###  1\. Registration

To access certain areas of the AdForum.com website (especially creative work), you must first complete a registration form to become either member (and access to Agency Preview’s agency portfolio’s for free) or subscriber (and get a full access to AdFolio for a fee). During registration, you may be required to provide professional contact information, such as name, email address and company type, to provide mailing address and payment information, and to choose a password. Your email is your login. We send all new registered members and subscribers a welcoming email to verify their password and username. When an email address is not working, the associated password might be deactivated by Maydream. 

###  2\. Subscription to the Newsletter

Should a user wish to receive our newsletter, we require them to provide professional contact information, such as name, company type and email address. Our newsletters are usually distributed via email. 

###  3\. Registration of a company in our database

Agencies, productions companies and other businesses may add themselves to AdForum.com directories. During the online process that allows them to do so, the personal information of the user who inputs the data is requested: name, email and phone number. An AdForum.com Information Center member may use this information to contact this person for verification purposes.  
If the company decides to buy an upgraded listing in our directory, see also buyer information collection below. 

###  4\. Buyer information collection

When buying a service on the site, users are asked for contact, billing and shipping information. These data may be used to process the order, to get the payment through the credit card company, to personalize the product(s) and/or the service(s) according to the order, and to ship the item(s) related to the ordered service, like questionnaires. If there is a problem with the order, a Maydream Representative may contact the user by email, phone, fax or mail. A confirmation email is sent for each online purchase.

During registration, a user may be required to provide professional contact information, such as name, company, company address, phone number, email address, and company type.
