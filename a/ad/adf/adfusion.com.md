## Adfusion Privacy Policy

**Welcome.**   At ARAnet, Inc, the company that operates Adfusion.com, we are committed to protecting the online privacy of visitors to our websites. This Policy applies only to the information collected through Adfusion.com. The purpose of this Policy is to inform you about the types of information we gather about you when you visit our websites, how we may use that information, and how we disclose it to third parties. Your use of this website is also subject to our Terms and Conditions. 

**Links and Advertisers on This Site.**   This website contains links to other websites, including to sites operated by advertisers that are clients of Adfusion. We provide these links for your convenience, but we do not review, control, or monitor the privacy practices of other sites. We are not responsible for the performance of these sites or for your business dealings with them. Your use of other web space is subject to the terms and conditions of those sites, including the privacy policies of those sites. Please note that we may allow third party advertisers to place ads on our pages. Those ads may include cookies. Our advertisers' use of cookies is subject to their own privacy policies, not this Policy. 

**Personal Information.**   Adfusion is not designed to collect any personally identifiable information about you, either via our website or Adfusion advertisements placed on publishing partners. Although the Adfusion website may include a page for businesses to contact us about advertising opportunities, this page is not intended for use by individual consumers. Providing such contact information is purely voluntary and is not necessary to view any article on this Site. We use contact information in order to contact a person in response to their request for advertising information. 

**Non-Personal Information and Cookies.**   When you visit Adfusion.com or view Adfusion advertisements on third-party websites, we collect certain non-personal information from your computer. This information is collected from your computer’s web browser and may include information such as the following (“non-personal information”):

-   the type of web browser software you use (for example, Internet Explorer)  
-   the name of the IP Address and/or domain from which you access the Internet (for example, Yahoo.com)  
-   the date and time you access our websites, as well as which pages were viewed

Adfusion retains certain information, such as IP addresses, for a short period to aid in the targeting of ads by location and for fraud detection and prevention. 

We and/or our advertisers or vendors may also place a text file called a "cookie" in the browser files of your computer when you visit. Cookies do not expose personal information. You are always free to decline our cookies if your browser permits, but some parts of our websites may not work properly for you if you do so. 

Adfusion uses the information collected for marketing and sales efforts, and to better target advertisements to people across the different websites they visit. We will use non-personal information to help us make our websites more useful to visitors and for other business purposes. We may use information from cookies to deliver content that you may find more interesting based upon the articles you have viewed in the past. We may prepare reports and other materials using non-personal information. We may share and use non-personal information without restriction because it does not identify who you are.  


Adfusion seeks to offer consumers meaningful privacy choices whenever possible.  We believe that providing targeted and relevant content and advertising to Internet users enhances the web-surfing experience. You can opt out of the use of your non-personal information for targeting purposes. By opting out, Adfusion will set an “opt-out cookie” on your computer, which will prevent your anonymous data from being matched to any particular machine. If you opt-out, you will continue to receive ads from Adfusion; however, it will prevent us delivering ads tailored to your preferences and usage and may prevent us from controlling the frequency with which you may view particular advertisements. You may opt-out of cookies used for data collection and targeting from Adfusion. Be advised that if you change computers or browsers, delete your cookies, or use multiple computers or browsers, you will need to repeat this process for each computer and each browser. In order to opt-out, follow the instructions located on our Opt-Out page located at the following URL: [ http://www.adfusion.com/adfusion.partnersite/optout.aspx](http://www.adfusion.com/adfusion.partnersite/optout.aspx)   


**Data Processed in US.**   By providing any information to us through this website, all users, including without limitation users in the member states of the European Union, fully understand and unambiguously consent to the collection, storage, forward transfer, and processing of such information in the United States of America.
