All personal information collected and used from the Ad Trader website will be processed in accordance with the 1998 Data Protection Act. 

## INFORMATION COLLECTED

### Online Advertisements

In order to place an advertisement on the Ad Trader website, you will need to register. We will require you to supply your name, e-mail address, postal address, postcode and telephone numbers. 

### Searches

In order to conduct a search on the AdTrader website, we will require you to supply a postcode and a keyword of the item you are searching for i.e. "bike" 

## USE OF INFORMATION

### General

Ad Trader is part of Trader Media Group and information supplied in this site may be shared within the group. We do not pass any information to third party companies but your advert may appear in one of Trader Media's partner publications or websites. When registered, Ad Trader is committed to continually improving and enhancing the service we offer and you will be notified of these changes by email or SMS. 

We have taken measures to ensure that information supplied to us is held securely. As a consequence - we may occasionally request proof of identity before allowing access to your personal information. 

Amendments and updates to this policy may be made from time to time. Any revisions will be posted on this page so you will always be aware of what information we collect. 

### Online Advertisements

Telephone numbers and email addresses supplied as part of an advertisement will be published within the relevant advertisement for the duration of the booking, to enable a potential buyer to contact the seller. The postcode is collected in order to provide a positioning on each item within our database, thereby enabling potential buyers to locate items for sale within a set radius of their chosen location. 

### Vehicle Searches

Postcodes and item information are collected in order to provide a relevant match of item against a specified search. The inclusion of the postcode enables us to provide the potential buyer with a range of items within a chosen locality, rather than items randomly spread throughout the country. 

### Registration

Email addresses are collected in order to send registrants their chosen password, providing them with online access to their registration details (available within the My Ad Trader section on the website). The user can access this information at any time in order to update their details. Other registration information is collected in order: 

  1. To generate an overall audience profile of visitors using the Ad Trader website. This information is then used to assist in developing relevant content on the website as well as ensuring that trade advertisers looking to reach specific audience groups are encouraged to place their stock or promotions on the website. 
  2. To provide our website visitors with monthly email updates of recent improvements or new offers. 
  3. To support our E-alerts functionality - whereby visitors to our website can store settings on item searches and/or set up alerts to be notified (by email) - when a specified item appears for sale on the Ad Trader website. Unless a visitor supplies their email address, we are unable to send such alerts. 
  4. To support our 'Send To A Friend' functionality - whereby visitors to our website can send details of items for sale to friends email addresses. 



## USE OF COOKIES

When you visit our website we issue a "cookie" or unique identification code that enables us to recognise your computer and store settings to help facilitate your use of our website. 

If your computer is configured to accept cookies we will be able to provide time saving functionality such as: 

  * the ability to pre-fill the search form with your postcode, thus preventing the need to re-input it each time you need to run a search. 
  * ready access to an online record on past advertisements you may have placed via the website. 
  * access to our E-alert functionality.



If your computer is cookie enabled we are also able to limit the number of occasions you are exposed to certain display advertisements on our site (such as banners and pop-up boxes). On most occasions this will mean you never see the same pop-up advertisement more than twice each time you visit the Ad Trader website. 

Please note you need to enable cookies in your browser in order to place an advert. For further information on cookies or for details on how to delete them or refuse their installation on your computer, please visit [www.aboutcookies.org](http://www.aboutcookies.org/). 

### Why we use cookies

AdTrader uses cookies for 4 purposes: 

  1. To enable the delivery of functionality that improves the ease and speed of using the Ad Trader website (see above). 
  2. To frequency cap display advertisements, particularly pop-up boxes. By limiting advertisement exposure we provide a more compelling user experience for website visitors and also ensure that advertisements on Ad Trader are more evenly spread across our user base. 
  3. To enable us to track the relative demand for different types of vehicles on the website. Such information enables us to better target advertising at users searching for specific vehicles. 
  4. To enable us to track the relative popularity of disparate parts of our website. This in turn enables us to concentrate our efforts on developing those parts of the website that are generating the greatest consumer demand.
