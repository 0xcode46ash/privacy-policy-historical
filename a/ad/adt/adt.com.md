**INFORMATION COLLECTED BY ADT - GENERAL USERS**  
In general, you can visit this Site without telling us who you are or revealing any information about yourself. ADT's web servers may collect the domain names, not the e-mail addresses, of visitors. This data helps us determine what is most beneficial for our users and how to continually create a better overall experience for them. This data does not include personally identifying information.

ADT may gather Personal Information so that we can improve and personalize your experience with ADT. Information that we collect falls into the following primary categories. We may receive Personal Information that you enter into the Site, provide in an online form, or provide in any other way. You can choose not to provide some or all of the Personal Information we ask for, but this may prevent you from using some of our Site's services and/or features.

In addition to the preceding categories of Personal Information, ADT also collects certain non-identifiable information (the "Non-Identifiable Information"). Whenever you interact with ADT, we receive and store certain types of Non-Identifiable Information. For example, we may use "cookies" to obtain information when your web browser accesses this Site. A cookie is an alphanumeric identifier which we transfer to your computer via your Web browser and store on your computer's hard drive. The cookie file allows us to recognize your computer when you visit our Site. On most web browsers you will find a "help" section on the toolbar. Please refer to this section for information on how to receive notification when you are receiving a new cookie, and how to turn cookies off. We recommend that you leave cookies turned on because they may enable you to take advantage of some of our Site's best features.

 **HOW DO WE USE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION AND OTHER NON-IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION?**  
ADT uses the Personal Information you provide to us through this Site in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Statement. If you provide Personal Information for a certain reason, we may use it in connection with the reason for which it was provided. For instance, if you contact us by e-mail, we may use the Personal Information you provide to answer your question or resolve your problem. If you contact us about a job listing, we may use your Personal Information to consider you for the position. ADT also uses your Personal Information and other Non-Identifiable Information collected through the Site to help us improve the content and functionality of the Site, to better understand our customers and markets, and to improve our products and services. ADT may also use your Personal Information to contact you, electronically or otherwise, in the future to tell you about products or services we believe will be of interest to you or to make it easier for you to use our site. If we do so, each communication we send you will contain instructions permitting you to "opt-out" of receiving future communications. 

**INFORMATION COLLECTED BY ADT - CUSTOMERS**  
In order to provide some of the services on ADT.com, we ask you to provide personal information such as, for example, your name, e-mail address, home or business address, phone number and existing account numbers.

We are not in the business of selling information about our users. We consider this information to be a vital part of our relationship with our customers and we treat it with great care and respect. There are, however, certain circumstances in which we may share your Personal Information with certain third parties, as set forth below. 

Marketing: We may use any statements that you communicate to us through the Site regarding ADT or any of our products and services for advertising or marketing purposes. In addition, ADT works closely with certain businesses to provide you with high quality products and services. On occasion, these companies make special offers available to ADT.com customers. You will have an opportunity to receive information about these offers. If you request to receive information about these offers, we will share your personal information with these companies so that they can send you details about their special offers. Each of these companies has its own policies with regard to the collection and use of personal information and ADT.com is not responsible for their use of your information.

Agents: ADT, like many companies, may hire other companies to perform certain functions, such as mailing communications, sending e-mail and managing databases. When we employ another company to perform a function of this nature, we only provide them with the Personal Information they need to complete the task and we endeavor to prohibit them from using that Personal Information for any other purpose. 

Business Transfers: As we develop our business, we might sell or buy businesses or assets. In transactions such as these, Personal Information may be one of the transferred business assets. 

Protection of ADT and Others: We may release account and other Personal information when we believe that such release is appropriate to comply with legal requirements, protect the rights, property or safety of our users, ADT or others, or enforce terms of our Terms of Use. In addition, we may exchange information with other organizations for fraud protection and risk reduction. 

Public Areas: Any submissions that you make to Public Areas will be considered public. ADT does not control, and is not responsible for, the actions of other users of the Site with respect to any information you post in Public Areas. In addition, information that you submit to Public Areas may be collected and used by others to send you unsolicited messages and for other purposes. 

Surveys & Contests: ADT may occasionally request information from you via surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary. The requested information typically includes contact information such as name and shipping address, and demographic information such as zip code. If you choose to participate in any survey or contest, the information you provide will be shared with the contest / survey sponsors to notify the winners and award prizes. Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this site. While ADT may use a third party intermediary to conduct surveys or contests, the third party may not use your personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes. 

**HOW SECURE IS INFORMATION ABOUT ME?**  
ADT uses reasonable measures to protect the Personal Information you provide to the Site from unauthorized access, deletion or alteration. However, the security of the Internet cannot be guaranteed. Accordingly, you should not provide any confidential information to this Site. 

**SECURE TRANSACTIONS**  
ADT maintains physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to guard any non-public personal information you provide. When you are in the secure portion of our Site, your personal information is protected by ADT's sophisticated security software. ADT's servers have been enabled with Secure Sockets Layer ("SSL") technology to automatically encrypt your information and help prevent unauthorized parties from viewing your non-account or credit card information during a secure session. That is why you must enter a unique User Name and Password each time you access your account information online. Additionally, when shoppers place an order, ADT.com securely stores the information in your account to log in and process over an SSL connection. 

ADT employs Digital Certificates, to authenticate that you are transacting with ADT online, used for the SSL encryption are provided by Thawte (Thawte is a wholly owned subsidiary of VeriSign, Inc.) and automatically use 40, 56, or 128 bit encryption based upon your browser's ability and security settings (the highest level possible is automatically selected).

At no time is any secure information sent using email or any insecure means.

Some Web browsers and some firewalls will not permit a secure connection. If your Web browser will not permit a secure connection, you can use a standard server connection to complete your transaction, but this method may not be secure.

To check that your browser is in secure mode, check that a "lock" or a "key" icon is displayed in the lower left-hand corner of your browser window. You can also check by looking at the URL bar on top of your browser. This line will typically show the first characters as "https" when a secure connection has been established rather than "http" which indicates a connection that is not secured.

 **CONTACTING ADT**  
If you have any questions about ADT, the Terms or ADT's Privacy Statement, please contact us by calling 1-800-ADT-ASAP (800-238-2727), send us an email at [webmaster@adt.com](mailto:webmaster@adt.com) or write to us at ADT Webmaster - Interactive Marketing, ADT Security Services, One Town Center Road, Boca Raton, Florida 33486. We use email links located on various areas of the Site to allow you to contact us directly with any questions or comments you may have. We read every message sent in and try to reply promptly to every one. We use the information you provide to respond directly to your questions or comments. We may also retain your comments to help us improve the site and any programs offered on the Site. Your personal information is only shared with persons not affiliated with ADT with your explicit permission. 

**UNSOLICITED E-MAIL**  
If you have received an unsolicited e-mail from ADT, you may have received it from a third party not affiliated in any way with ADT. ADT does not engage in, nor do we condone the practice of sending out mass emails that are unsolicited by their recipients. Unfortunately, some third parties and individuals can create e-mail messages with forged addresses in the FROM: field. This can have the effect of making the message look more legitimate. If you receive such an e-mail, please be aware that these messages originate completely outside of ADT's e-mail system and therefore we have little or no control over them. In most cases we may not even know this is taking place.

Please be sure that we are taking every measure available to us to prevent this type of occurrence but, at this time we are unable to guarantee that it can be completely eliminated. Additionally, if we do send e-mail to our customers, we will, where appropriate, allow the recipient to request not to be contacted in the future. 

If you wish to contact us about any e-mail issue that you feel is ADT related, please send your message to [webmaster@adt.com](mailto:webmaster@adt.com) or call us (800) ADT-ASAP (800-238-2727).
