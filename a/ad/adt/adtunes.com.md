**Information Collected and Stored**

To post on Adtunes we require a valid email address. This information, together with your IP address when you register and post, is collected and retained along with your topic posts. You may choose to make available and save other personal information such as name, age, location, email address, photograph, on line contact details, interest etc via your Control Panel. 

Messages and emails transmitted through Adtunes may be stored. 

Other information that is collected is from web site logs (such as browser and operating system information, Internet service provider, etc.) but these are generally non-personal. 

**Usage and Disclosure of Information**

Adtunes does not sell, rent, loan, trade, or lease any personal information collected at this site, including email addresses, demographics, etc., unless otherwise noted. Any personal information gathered will be of a voluntary nature. 

We do reserve the right to disclose user information to third parties when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing (or planning) injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) our rights or property, other web site users, or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities. This includes disrupting our site. We may disclose personal information without notice to you when we believe in good faith that the law requires it or to respond to an emergency situation. 

If registered, you may elect, via your user control panel to allow other members to email you. This is done without disclosing your email address to the sender. 

To assist in the maintenance of your account with the Adtunes (lost passwords for example) it may be necessary for the Adtunes server, an Administrator or Moderator to contact you via your email address. Adtunes reserves the right to send messages to your email address to establish the validity of that email address or resolve any issues with your Adtunes account. 

Usage statistics from web site logs may be provided to other interested parties. 

We will use all reasonable efforts to safeguard the confidentiality of any personal information but will have no liability for disclosure of any information obtained due to errors in transmission or the unauthorized acts of third parties.
