We require these third parties to maintain appropriate security to protect your information from unauthorized access or processing.
  * _As Required or Appropriate by Law._ We may disclose your information to regulatory authorities, courts, and government agencies where we believe that doing so would be in accordance with or permitted or required by any applicable law, regulation or legal process, to defend the interests, rights, and/or property of NASDAQ or others, or to respond to emergencies.
  * _Business Transfers._ We may transfer your information to a third party in the event of any reorganization, merger, sale, joint venture, assignment, transfer or other disposition of all or any portion of our business, brands, affiliates, subsidiaries or other assets.



We may share your information with other parties as directed by you or subject to your consent. We may also share and otherwise process aggregated information or de-identified information that does not identify you individually with other parties.

This technology involves placing small files/code on your device or browser that serve a number of purposes, such as remembering your preferences (e.g., language) and generally improving your experience on our Sites. Specifically, we may use such technology for purposes such as to:

  * Provide us with general analytics about our Sites, including demographic information in a non-identifiable form, in order to improve our Sites’ performance and customize users’ experience;
  * Support security measures, such as requiring re-login into your account;
  * Allow you to engage in our social media offerings on our Sites (e.g., Facebook “Like” button and LinkedIn integration); and

Please note that we may need to retain certain information for recordkeeping purposes, to complete any transactions that you began prior to your request, or for other purposes as required or permitted by applicable law. In addition, please note that even if you opt-out of receiving marketing communications from one or all of our Sites, we may need to send you service-related communications and may need to keep information we have collected about you for record-keeping, research and other purposes.

## Access And Correction Of Your Information

## Security Of Your Information

We take reasonable technical, administrative and physical security measures to protect your information, including applying generally accepted industry standards to protect the information submitted to us during transmission and once we receive it. When we request sensitive information (e.g., credit card number) from you, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (“SSL”). However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure, so we unfortunately cannot guarantee absolute security. If you have reason to believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure (e.g., if you feel that the security of any account you might have with us has been compromised), please contact us immediately as detailed under the “Contact Us” heading below.

## International Transfers

Some of the parties with which we may share your information, as detailed in “How We Share Your Information”, may be located in countries that do not provide an equivalent level of protection as your home country. Where required, NASDAQ has implemented appropriate cross-border transfer solutions to provide adequate protection for transfers of certain personal information, including, but not limited to, the European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses (http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/international-transfers/transfer/index_en.htm). By using our Sites, and providing us information about you, you consent to the international transfer of information about you to the above parties.

## Tell-a-friend

If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about one our Sites, we will ask you for your friend’s name and email address. We will automatically send your friend a one-time email to invite him/her to access the specific Site, and store his/her email address for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email and tracking the success of our referral program. Your friend may contact us as detailed under the “Contact Us” heading below to request we remove this information from our database.

Our Sites may contain links to other websites or services that are not owned or controlled by NASDAQ, including links to websites of our advertisers, sponsors and partners.

## Cookies

A cookie is a small text file saved on your device or browser. Some of these cookies are necessary for the functioning of our Sites (known as “strictly necessary” cookies), while others are not (known as “non-essential” cookies). Some cookies (known as “persistent cookies”) will remain on your device until you delete them, while others (known as “session cookies”) are automatically erased when you exit your Internet browser. We do not link the information we store in cookies to your information.

You can set your device or browser to accept or reject most cookies, or to notify you in most situations that a cookie is offered so that you can decide whether to accept it. However, if you block cookies, certain features on our Sites may not function. Additionally, even if you block or delete Cookies, not all tracking will necessarily stop.

We may place or recognize technology on your browser or device when you visit our Sites for purposes of serving you targeted advertising (also referred to as “online behavioral advertising”). We also work with third party advertising companies who place their own cookies or similar technology on your browser or device when you visit our Sites and other websites to serve customized advertisements to you as you browse the Internet. As noted above, you can set your device or browser to accept or reject most cookies, or at least notify you in most situations that the technology is offered. As an additional step, these advertising companies may participate in one of the following advertising industry self-regulatory programs for online behavioral advertising, with corresponding user opt-outs:

  * Networking Advertising Initiative (<http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/>) **(US Only)**
  * Digital Advertising Alliance (<http://www.aboutads.info/choices/>) **(US Only)**
  * European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance (<http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/>) **(EU Only)**
  * Digital Advertising Alliance - Canada (<http://youradchoices.ca/choices>) **(Canada Only)**
  * DAA App Choices Mobile App **(Mobile Devices Only)** \- For mobile devices (e.g., smartphone, tablets), you may consider downloading the DAA AppChoices Mobile App to manage such technology. 



Please note that even if you reject such technology, you may continue to receive advertisements, but the advertisements will not be tailored to your browsing activities and interests.

## Log Files

We automatically gather log files, such as your IP addresses, browser type, internet service provider, referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data when you use our Sites. We may combine information in log files with your information.

## Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs/Embedded Pixels)

Clear Gifs are embedded on our Sites and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. The information collected by these technologies is associated with other technology and information, but only for internal tracking purposes only. We do not disclose or divulge such linkages outside of NASDAQ.

## Flash LSOs

Flash Local Storage Objects (“Flash LSOs” / “Flash Cookies”) display content based upon your preferences for how you like to view our Sites. Flash LSOs are different from browser cookies because of the amount of, type of, and how information is stored. Cookie management tools provided by your browser will not remove Flash LSOs.
