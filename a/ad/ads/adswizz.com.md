##### Privacy Policy:

AdsWizz (“AdsWizz, ” “we” or “us”) is an audio and video ad serving tech company. We enable online radio and video publishers and advertisers to get to know their audience by providing precise session-based measurements.  Our customers use our solutions to deliver relevant online advertisements into their streams.

The following sets forth the privacy practices and policy (“Privacy Policy”) related to the business we operate. It covers all data on website visitors/listeners that we collect for the purpose of delivering and enhancing our services.  We are committed to protecting consumer privacy by informing you what information we collect, how we use it, and with whom we may share it.We adhere to the Privacy Principles adopted by the Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB).

##### **What information do we collect to perform our services?**

We collect or receive data from our customers (publishers/advertisers) in order to learn about the ads you might be interested in. This data includes but is not limited to browser identifier, wireless carrier, IP address, device type (website player, smartphone apps, Winamp media player…) and browsing information.

We also measure the exposure to online advertising campaign: number of impressions, number of clicks, numbers of users exposed, percentage of ad content played. We retain information on the ads that we served to you on a website and we reuse that information to deliver new ads when you visit another website on which we also serve ads. We do not collect information about your interests and insofar we collect information as to your reaction to the ad (skip the ad, click on the ad), we use it for statistic reporting purposes or for preventing ads to be served to you more often than foreseen.

Furthermore, none of the information we collect to provide our services can be traced back to a specific individual. We have no idea who you are. To us, you are just “user123” for example. You may also be “user234” if you use two different devices or browsers (IE and Firefox, for example) on the same device. And if you share your device with a family member or friend, we can’t tell who is who, so “user123” may in fact be a mixture of several people.

##### How do we use this informations

We process the data to find elements that will help us determine which products/services could be relevant to you and to improve the quality of the ads you’ll be served. For example, we may use the geo-location data to determine potential likelihood to listen to an ad or we may use the data collected to prevent the same ads to be served to you repeatedly.

We also use the information we collect to maintain, improve and develop new services.  We finally deliver a list of anonymous user identifiers and produce reports and analytics for our business partners.

##### Disclosure of information

We share anonymous user identifiers and aggregated information with established 3rd party publishers/advertisers such as the number of users who visited a publisher site, or the number of users who listened to a particular ad, strictly for serving advertisements. We do not share users data between different publishers/advertisers.

We may share information with companies, organizations or individuals outside of AdsWizz if we have a good-faith belief that we are obligated to do so by law or as necessary to protect ourselves or others.

Finally, we may transfer information in our possession to a successor entity in connection with a corporate change in control such as a merger or acquisition or the sale of company assets. In this case, your information will remain subject to this/an equivalent privacy policy.

##### Buy across all formats:

Buy advertising inventories on any kind of content such as: live streams, simulcast streams, podcasts, catch-up & on-demand thus creating broader reach.

##### Other Website

Through our services, we may link to other websites operated by other companies. This Privacy Policy does not apply to these linked websites. Each website should be checked for its own privacy policy.

##### Data security

We take all reasonable measures to protect the information we collect and store. All data is stored in a secure facility and we strictly control access to the data.

##### Changes to This Policy

This Privacy Policy is subject to change. We will post the updated version on our Website. Whenever a change is significant, we will place a prominent notice on this Website. We encourage you to periodically review this page for the latest information on our privacy practices.
