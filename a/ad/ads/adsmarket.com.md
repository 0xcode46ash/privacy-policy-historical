### Cookies

Cookies are identifiers that a website can send to your browser to keep on your computer in order to facilitate your next visit to the site. The use of cookies is an industry standard, and many websites use them. AdsMarket does not use cookies that persist on your hard-drive. We do use dynamic, non-intrusive session cookies, which reside in your browser's memory only for the duration of your user session, to assist in the ordering and purchasing process. AdsMarket also uses data collected through session cookies for the purpose of identifying the source of traffic (which ad or link you used to reach us), and general patterns of activity on our site. No personally identifiable information is stored in this cookie. AdsMarket uses this data to better understand what services and support is valuable to our customers, and how we can continue to provide the best online experience possible to our users.

We may use information in the following ways: 

  * To enhance existing features or develop new features, products and services. 
  * To provide Advertisers and other third parties with aggregate information about our user base and usage patterns. 
  * To allow us to personalize the content and advertising that you and others see based on personal characteristics or preferences. 
  * For the purposes you specifically provided the information including, for example, enabling us to process, validate and verify purchases. 
  * To register you as a client and establish an account for you. 
  * To send you email notifications about our new or existing AdsMarket products and services, special offers, or to otherwise contact you.
