Information provided from our users through online subscription, renewal services, and from special features of our site such as the "Share your Story" area is used only for its intended purpose. 

Certain offerings on our site, such as gift subscription opportunities and “send to a friend” tools on article pages, allow users to submit personal information about other people to our site. We use this information to fulfill gifts our users have ordered for others or to send the recommended article via email, and not for additional marketing purposes.

### User Information

ADDitudeMag.com web servers automatically collect information about which pages each user visits and the domain name of visitors. This is used for internal review, to tailor information to individual visitors and for traffic audits. We also provide this information (as well as information from third-party market researchers) about our users on an aggregated, anonymous basis to our advertisers and partners. 

ADDitude may place a “cookie” on the browser of an ADDitudeMag.com user's computer. Information gathered through the use of cookies is not related to any personally identifiable details. A cookie can be used to tell when your computer has contacted a Web site; we use the information for editorial purposes and for other purposes such as delivery of ads, so we can customize delivery of information without compromising privacy. For example, cookies are used to ensure that you don't see the same ad too many times in a single session. In some instances, advertisers will set cookies on our site. These cookies are not related to any personally identifiable information that we have collected but are for monitoring and tracking ad impressions. 

Many browsers are set to accept cookies. You may prefer to set your browser to refuse cookies. It is possible, however, that some areas of the site will not function properly if you do so. This is especially likely when trying to order a product or play an online game.

ADDitudeMag.com will not share mailing lists from its electronic newsletters with any additional third parties without first obtaining permission from all subscribers.

### Partner Policies

We do not control the privacy policies of our business partners, advertisers, sponsors or other sites to which we provide hyperlinks.

We may disclose personally identifiable information in response to a court order or law enforcement agency’s request, or where we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of our terms of use, or as otherwise required by law. In addition, we may transfer information about you if we are acquired by or merged with another company. 

Technology on the Internet is developing at a rapid pace, and we need to maintain our flexibility in the online arena. If we need to change our policy in the future, we will post these changes as soon as they go into effect.
