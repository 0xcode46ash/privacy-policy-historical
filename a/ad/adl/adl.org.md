What Information Do We Collect?

ADL believes that personally identifying information, such as your name, postal and e-mail address or telephone number, is private and confidential. You can have general access to our site without providing any personally identifying information. ADL only collects personally identifying information when you voluntarily submit it, such as when you e-mail comments to the site, when you make an online donation, when you send a letter to your Congressional representative, or when you request information. This information is used for internal purposes only and helps us determine how we can improve the site to meet your needs. From time to time, we may use this information to contact you about ADL. When you make an online donation, ADL will collect your credit card number and expiration date so that it can process your donation.

Is the Information You provide Secure?

ADL has implemented security measures to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the credit card and other information under our control. We use high grade encryption and the https security protocol to communicate with your browser software. This makes it extremely difficult for anyone else to intercept or access the credit card information you send us to make an online donation.
