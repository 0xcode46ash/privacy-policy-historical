**Information collected by Cookies and Web Beacons, etc.**

(a) Ad Communal uses cookies to enable you to sign in to certain services and to help personalize your online experience. A cookie is a small text file that is placed on your hard disk by a web server. Some cookies are used only to assist you with your session on a Website – such cookies expire automatically after you terminate your session. Ad Communal also uses cookies to improve the sign-in experience on certain Websites. For example, your user ID may be stored in a cookie that will remain on your computer after you terminate your session. This cookie allows your user ID to be pre-populated, so that you will only need to type your password the next time you sign in. Finally, Ad Communal may place a cookie on your hard disk on behalf of a sponsor when such sponsor’s web page is shown, so that the sponsor can measure the effectiveness of such web page. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies can only be accessed or read by the domain that placed them. You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to sign in or use certain features of a Website that depend on cookies. 

(b) Web Beacons:   
A web beacon is a programming code that can be used to display an image on a web page, but can also be used to transfer your unique user identification to a database and associate you with previously acquired information about an individual in a database. This allows AD COMMUNAL INC. to track certain websites you visit. Web beacons are used to track AD COMMUNAL INC. behavioral habits for marketing purposes to determine products or services with which you may be interested. In addition to using web beacons on web pages, AD COMMUNAL INC. also uses web beacons in email messages sent to individuals listed in AD COMMUNAL INC.'s database.

(c) IP Addresses:   
AD COMMUNAL INC. automatically tracks certain information based upon your behavior on the Site. We may use this information to do internal research on our users' demographics, interests, and behavior to better understand, protect and serve you and our community. This information may include the URL that you just came from (whether this URL is on the site or not), which URL you next go to (whether this URL is on the site or not), your computer browser information, and your Internet Protocol address. Your Internet Protocol ("IP") address is a unique Internet "address" which is assigned to you by your Internet Service Provider ("ISP"). For local area network ("LAN"), DSL, or cable modem users, an IP address may be permanently assigned to a particular computer. IP addresses are automatically logged by Web servers, collecting information about a user's traffic patterns. While the IP address does not identify an individual by name, it may, with the cooperation of the ISP, be used to locate and identify an individual using the Web. Your IP address can, however, reveal what geographic area you are connecting from, or which ISP you are using. Finally, other websites you visit have IP addresses, and we may collect the IP addresses of those websites and their pages.

(d) Computer Profiles:   
AD COMMUNAL INC. may also collect and accumulate other anonymous data which will help us understand and analyze the Internet experience of our visitors. For instance, AD COMMUNAL INC. may accumulate visitor data relating to referring domain names, the type of browsers used, operating system software, screen resolutions, color capabilities, browser plug-ins, language settings, cookie preferences, search engine keywords and JavaScript enablement. When you provide us with Personal Information, we are able to use such visitor data to identify you.
