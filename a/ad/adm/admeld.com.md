# Privacy Policy: Admeld

**Effective:** July 1, 2009  
**Last updated:** January 14, 2011

We, AdMeld Inc. ("AdMeld"), provide our customers (i.e. web publishers) with a set of technologies and services designed to help them maximize their ad revenues. The primary way we do this is by connecting our customers with a variety of ad buyers and, through our ad optimization technology ("Technology"), enabling them to make intelligent decisions about how they sell their ad inventory.

This Privacy Policy describes AdMeld's privacy practices as they pertain to (i) our Technology, and (ii) our corporate website located at [http://www.admeld.com](http://www.admeld.com/) (our "Site").

If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at [[privacy@admeld.com](mailto:privacy@admeld.com)](mailto:privacy@admeld.com).  
 

###  1\. Technology

Our customers use our Technology to determine which buyer will pay them the most to fill ad inventory located on their web sites and applications. As a result, you may encounter our Technology when you visit our customers' web sites and applications and view a page in which they have enabled our Technology. We also provide performance reporting to our customers, partners, and buyers regarding their use of our Technology.

**PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION**  
We have no use for Personally Identifiable Information ("PII") and we take all precautions to avoid receiving PII from our customers and partners. PII is data that can be used directly, or with reasonable effort, indirectly, to contact or identify you, and may include, but is not limited to, your name, phone number, email address and home address. Due to the nature of the Internet, however, we cannot completely control the type of information they may send to our servers. If we are made aware that we received PII, we will use all efforts to remove that information from our records. In addition, if we are made aware that we have inadvertently passed PII to our customers or partners, we will use all efforts to ensure they remove that information from their records.

**AD TAGS**  
Our customers deploy our Technology by placing our ad tags on their web sites and applications, and such ad tags are used to deliver ads from buyers. Ad tags usually contain anonymous information about the web site, section of the site and size of the ad that we are optimizing.

**COOKIES**  
Our Technology stores a persistent cookie in your browser that contains only Non-Personally Identifiable Information ("Non-PII"). Most Internet browsers automatically accept cookies. You can instruct your browser, by editing its options, to stop accepting cookies or prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. We do not use cookies to retrieve PII from your computer. You can also opt-out of receiving cookies from our Technology. [Get more information about cookies and web beacons](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/cookies/).

**OPTING OUT**  
You can opt-out from having us collect your Non-PII in connection with our Technology. The opt-out process will place an opt-out cookie on your computer. The opt-out cookie tells our Technology not to collect your Non-PII and to avoid writing another cookie to your computer. Please note that if you delete, block or otherwise restrict cookies, or if you use a different computer or Internet browser, you may need to renew your opt-out choice.

Another way to opt out of our cookies is through the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI), and industry group in which we are a member. The NAI is a cooperative of online marketing and analytics companies committed to building consumer awareness and establishing responsible business and data management practices and standards. You can [visit the NAI](http://www.networkadvertising.org/) site to learn more about the privacy practices their members abide by, and [opt-out of ad targeting based on their cookies](http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp).

**COLLECTION AND SHARING OF INFORMATION**  
Our Technology collects and uses Non-PII such as the IP address you use to access the Internet, the type of browser you are using, which and how many web pages you have viewed, the date and time your browser requested an ad, and how many ads your browser requested.

We may share Non-PII collected via our Technology with our customers and partners. Similarly, we may enhance the Non-PII collected via our Technology with Non-PII collected from our customers and partners. This information cannot be used to contact or identify any person individually.

Please be aware that the web sites of our customers as well as the web sites linked through the ads delivered as a result of our Technology may collect information from you. Such information may include Non-PII through the use of cookies and other technology and any PII you may choose to give in registering and transacting with such web sites. Although we choose our business partners and clients carefully, we are not responsible for the privacy practices of web sites operated by such third parties. You should check the applicable privacy policies of such web sites you visit to determine how they handle any information they collect from you.

Our Technology interfaces with the following entities:

  * **Our Customers' Web Sites  
**

In some cases, our customers can choose to use our ad tags to pass information to buyers about you, such as demographic information you have previously volunteered to them (for example, during the registration process) so long as they have the right to use this information for ad selection. Our policy forbids such information to be PII, and if we are made aware that we were unknowingly passed PII, we will purge such information from our servers and request that such customer cease sending us such information.  We are not responsible for the privacy practices of these web sites and you should check the applicable privacy policies of such web sites you visit to determine how they handle any information they collect from you.

  * **Ad Buyers  
**

The ads delivered as a result of our Technology are served by third parties that may use their own cookies and/or other data collection tools. In addition, the ads themselves may also contain links to other websites with their own cookies and/or other data collection tools.

  

  * **Third Party Data Providers  
**

Third party data providers are companies that collect information about your behaviors through relationships with many of the web sites you visit. For example, many of them collect Non-PII about the content areas or pages of the web sites that you visit (e.g., "sports section" or "technology section"). We partner with many of these third parties to provide their data to our customers in aggregate and anonymous form. For example, if one of our customers learns that 25% of their audience is interested in sports, this helps them sell advertising more effectively.




**NETWORK ADVERTISING INITIATIVE (NAI)**  
We are amember of the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI), as are many of the buyers and third party data providers we work with. You can [visit the NAI](http://www.networkadvertising.org/) site to learn more about the privacy practices their members abide by, and [opt-out of ad targeting based on their cookies](http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp).

**RETENTION OF INFORMATION**  
We retain the Non-PII collected via our Technology for up to 90 days. Aggregate reports generated from such data may be retained for a longer period.
