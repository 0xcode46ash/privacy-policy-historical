**

AdMeld Inc. ("AdMeld") provides web publishers with a set of technologies and services designed to help them more effectively monetize their advertising inventory through ad networks and exchanges. 

This Privacy Policy describes AdMeld's privacy practices as they pertain to (i) our ad optimization technology ("Technology"), and (ii) visitors to our corporate website located at www.admeld.com (our "Site").

If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please feel free to contact us at [privacy@admeld.com](mailto:privacy@admeld.com).

  


### **1\. Technology Privacy Policy**

  


**Overview of AdMeld's Technology**   
AdMeld's Technology does not serve ads, it decides which ad networks or exchanges should serve ads on our publisher customer's websites. Generally, your may encounter our Technology when you visit our customer's websites and view a page in which the publisher has enabled our Technology.

**What information is collected?**  
AdMeld's Technology does not collect Personally Identifiable Information ("PII"). Our Technology does collect and use Non-PII, including: the IP address used to access the Internet, the type of browser used, which and how many publisher web pages have been viewed, the date and time an ad was requested, and how many ads were requested.

**Cookies**  
AdMeld's Technology stores a cookie on your computer hard drive with Non-PII that it uses to keep track of the number of ads you have viewed on our customers' websites. This frequency data is stored not in the cookie itself, but in AdMeld's servers. This data is cleared from our servers every 90 days. Most Internet browsers automatically accept cookies. You can instruct your browser, by editing its options, to stop accepting cookies or prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. You can also opt-out of recieving cookies from AdMeld's Technology.

**Ad Tags**  
AdMeld's customers activate our Technology by placing our ad tags on their websites. Ad tags usually contain information about the website, section of the site and size of the ad that AdMeld is optimizing. In some cases, a web publisher can choose to use our ad tags to pass Non-PII information to networks and exchanges about you, such as demographic information you have previously volunteered to the website (for example, during the registration process) so long as the website has the right to use this information for ad selection.

AdMeld is a technology vendor to our customers and we take all necessary precautions to avoid receiving PII from our clients. Due to the nature of the Internet, however, we cannot completely control the type of information a client may send to AdMeld's servers, or prevent a client from sending PII. 

**Third Party Links and Websites**   
The ads delivered as a result of our Technology are served by third parties that may use their own cookies and/or other data collection tools. In addition, the ads themselves may also contain links to other websites with their own cookies and/or other data collection tools. AdMeld is not responsible for the privacy practices, policies or the content of such third parties and websites. 

AdMeld encourages everyone interacting with ads from any source to learn more about the privacy practices of those serving it. AdMeld has no control over the use of any information by third party and/or websites, and you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose any PII. Similarly, AdMeld does not have access to, or control of, the cookies and/or other data collection tools that may be placed on any advertisement by a third-party, including those of our partners, and this Privacy Policy does not cover the use of cookies and/or other data collection tools by any third party.

Many of the third party networks and exchanges we work with are members of the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI). You can [visit the NAI](http://www.networkadvertising.org/) site to learn more about the advertising practices their members, and opt-out of ad targeting based on their cookies [here](http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp).
