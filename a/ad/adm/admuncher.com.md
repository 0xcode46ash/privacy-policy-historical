# Ad Muncher - Privacy Policy

Privacy Policy  
  
We may store information about an Ad Muncher user under the following conditions:

**During contact with us**  
The information stored is whatever we receive from and send to the user.  This is done mainly to aid trouble-shooting by, for example, allowing us to quickly see what problem solutions we have already suggested.

**When purchasing Ad Muncher**  
The information stored is the information provided during ordering, as well as the registration code that is issued and any payment tracking information.

**When Ad Muncher contacts its servers**  
When Ad Muncher contacts its servers to retrieve updates, request a trial license, verify a registration or send us user feedback (such as fault reports or site reports), it will also send some or all of the following information:

  * The version of Ad Muncher being used.
  * The local time and date on their system (not sent in Ad Muncher v4.71 onwards).
  * A short [hash](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function) of their system's hardware configuration.  This hash is virtually useless in determining what hardware is being used, and is only useful for determining if one system is different to another for licensing purposes.

Additionally, if the user is registered the following information may be sent: 
  * The user's registration name.
  * The user's registration code.
  * A license ID number.

This information may be stored for the purposes of verifying that Ad Muncher registrations are not used on more than the purchased number of systems, and to ensure that trial licenses are being granted when they should be.

If the user has downloaded Ad Muncher from a commission-branded site (eg: http://COMMISSION_NAME.admuncher.com/) then Ad Muncher will also send the commission account name so that we can pay the appropriate commission.

**Email Address Usage**  
We will never send regular unsolicited emails (eg: newsletters) unless specifically requested.

**Policies Regarding Third Parties**  
Information provided to our staff will not be sold, rented or traded to any third party under any conditions.

**Privacy Policy Changes**  
Any changes to the privacy policy will be posted here.  If you have any further questions about our privacy practices (or anything else) please feel free to [contact us](https://web.archive.org/web/20080516031418id_/http%3A//www.admuncher.com/contact.shtml).
