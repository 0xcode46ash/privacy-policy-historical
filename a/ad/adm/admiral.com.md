### 2\.    HOW YOUR INFORMATION WILL BE USED

Your information will be used for a number of purposes which include: automatically processing your quotations; managing and administering your policy including claims handling; delivering any services, products or information requested by you; responding to complaints or policy enquiries; administering debt recoveries; verifying your identity when required (we take our data security very seriously and we may need to ask you for other 'identifiable' information to protect your data from unauthorised access); undertaking market and product analysis based on your use of our services and products; keeping you informed about products, services, promotions, special offers and new developments; fraud prevention and detection purposes; credit scoring or other automated decision making systems to process and record personal information.

Admiral Insurance Services Ltd may use your information to keep you informed by post, telephone or email of products and services including but not limited to car insurance, other automotive or financial products, or other carefully selected offers which it feels may interest you. If you do not wish your data to be used in this way, please write to the Marketing Department, Admiral Insurance Services Ltd, Capital Tower, Greyfriars Road, Cardiff, CF10 3AZ, who will ensure that your data is not used for such purposes.

In order to offer you the security of continuous cover on your policy, Admiral Insurance Services Limited will arrange for your policy to be automatically renewed when your cover expires.

You should be aware that Admiral Insurance Services Limited is only able to guarantee automatic renewal where:

Unless we hear from you to the contrary Admiral Insurance Services Limited is entitled to assume at the time of renewal that your details have not changed and you have the consent of the card holder as detailed.

Should you wish to make changes to your current policy during the term of that policy then, unless you inform us otherwise, Admiral Insurance Services Limited will charge the payment details held on record for any additional amount due.

You may inform us of changes in your circumstances or choose to opt out of automatic renewal at any time in writing or by contacting our Customer Service department.

**Non-personal**

If you wish to visit our web site, you can do so without disclosing any personal information, although we may use cookies and collect non-personal information about your browsing (click-stream) activities.

‘Cookies’ are small pieces of information sent by a web server to a web browser, which enables the server to collect information from the browser. You can find out more about the way cookies work on [http://www.cookiecentral.com](http://www.cookiecentral.com/). 

We use cookies for a number of purposes, for instance to enable us to simplify the logging on process for registered users, to help ensure the security and authenticity of registered users, to provide the mechanisms for online quotes and to enable traffic monitoring.

Non-registered visitors of the site are sent anonymous cookies to keep track of their browsing patterns and build up a demographic profile.

Whilst you do not need to allow your browser to accept personal cookies in order to browse our web site or access many of our services, you must have session cookies enabled if you wish to quote online or access any areas reserved for registered users. Session cookies do not hold personal information, they merely enable you to progress safely through our secure web site.

Without session cookies, we are unable to provide you with a quote or access our web site. If you have any queries regarding session cookies and our use of them, please feel free to contact the Information Security Officer on 029 20434252.

You can block all personal cookies and still obtain a quote but the web site won't function if session state cookies are disabled.

  | 

We will endeavour to treat all your personal information as private and confidential. Other than under the terms of this Privacy Statement we will not disclose any of your information to anyone. We would like to bring your attention though to our obligations to disclose information in the following four exceptional cases permitted by law. These are:

  * where we are legally compelled to do so; 
  * where there is a duty to the public to disclose; 
  * where disclosure is required to protect our interest; 
  * where disclosure is made at your request or with your consent.

  | 

From time to time we will employ agents and subcontractors to process your information on our behalf. We may allow such agents and subcontractors, including collection agencies and field collectors, access to your personal information. The same duty of confidentiality and security will apply to our agents and subcontractors and all processing will be carried out under our instruction.

Should you take the decision to make a complaint about the service we have provided, we may be obliged to forward details about your complaint, including your personal information, to the relevant ombudsman in existence at the time. You can be assured that they are similarly obliged to adhere to the Data Protection Act and keep your information strictly confidential.

In the unfortunate event that you have to make a claim then we will need to disclose information with any other parties involved in that claim. This may include third parties involved with the claim, any third party's insurer, their solicitor or similar representative, medical teams, police and other investigators. If necessary we may also have to investigate your claims and conviction history in the course of administering the claim. You can be assured that we will keep such investigations strictly confidential.

Insurers pass information to the Claims Underwriting and Exchange Register, run by Insurance Database Services (IDS) and the Motor Insurance Anti-Fraud and Theft Register, run by the Association of British Insurers (ABI). The aim is to help insurers check information provided and also prevent fraudulent claims. When we deal with your request for insurance, if applicable, we may search these registers. Under the conditions of your policy, you must tell us about any incident (such as accident or theft) which may or may not give rise to a claim. When you tell us about an incident we will pass information, relating to it, to the registers.

Your policy details will be added to the Motor Insurance Database (MID), run by the Motor Insurers' Information Centre (MIIC). MID data may be used by the DVLA and the DVLNI for the purpose of Electronic Vehicle Licensing and by the Police for the purposes of establishing whether a driver's use of the vehicle is likely to be covered by a motor insurance policy and/or for preventing and detecting crime. If you are involved in an accident (in the UK or abroad), other UK insurers, the Motor Insurers' Bureau and MIIC may search the MID to obtain relevant policy information.

Persons pursuing a claim in respect of a road traffic accident (including citizens of other countries) may also obtain relevant information which is held on the MID.

You can find out more about this from us, or at [www.miic.org.uk](http://www.miic.org.uk/).

We make searches about you at credit reference agencies who will supply us with information, including information from the Electoral Register and credit information. The agencies will record details of the search whether or not this application proceeds. The searches will not be seen or used by lenders to assess your ability to obtain credit. We may use scoring methods to assess this application and to verify your identity. Credit searches and other information which is provided to us and/or the credit reference agencies, about you and those with whom you are linked financially may be used by Admiral Insurance Services Limited and other companies if you, or other members of your household, apply for other facilities including insurance applications and claims. This information may also be used for debt tracing and the prevention of money laundering as well as the management of your account. Alternatively, we may ask you to provide physical forms of identification.  


**Fraud prevention and detection notice**

In order to prevent and detect fraud we may at any time:

  * share information about you with our other Group companies; 
  * pass your details to Insurance Hunter a central insurance application and claims checking system whereby it may be checked against information held by Insurance Hunter and shared with other insurers; 
  * check your details with fraud prevention agencies and if you give us false or inaccurate information and we suspect fraud, we will record this. 



We and other organisations may also use and search these records to:

  * help make decisions about credit and credit related services for you and members of your household; 
  * help make decisions on motor, household, business, credit, life and other insurance proposals and insurance claims for you and members of your household; 
  * trace debtors, recover debt, prevent fraud and to manage your accounts or insurance policies; 
  * check your identity to prevent money laundering unless you furnish us with other satisfactory proof of identity; 
  * undertake credit searches and additional fraud searches. If you would like details of the agencies we use please call 0800 052 3144.

We recognise that our customers are increasingly concerned about how companies protect personal information from misuse and abuse and about privacy in general. We are constantly reviewing and enhancing our technical, physical and managerial procedures and rules to protect your personal data from unauthorised access, accidental loss and/or destruction.

On our web sites we have taken care to protect any information that you have given us by providing you with a User ID and a password. We also use industry standard secure sockets layer (SSL) 128 bit encryption technology, for example, to encrypt sensitive information such as your credit card and other financial information.

The User ID and unique password relevant to some of our web site users, helps us to protect your personal information. You must keep this password safe and must not disclose it to anyone. You may need a User ID and password to access your personal information on our web site. We will accept no responsibility or liability if a third party obtains and uses your User ID and password. You must tell us immediately if you have lost your User ID or password, or if you believe a third party may have obtained it. Please also tell us if you would like us to change your User ID or password for any reason.

When you ask for a quote from us, we will process the data on a secure server. Microsoft Internet Explorer and Netscape Navigator will confirm that you are in a secure area by displaying an unbroken key or a lock in the bottom right corner of your browser window.

Some organisations have a security feature called a firewall to protect their computer systems. These firewalls may prevent you from connecting to our secure server to get a quote. If you are at work and cannot connect to our site, please consult with your IT administrator to learn more. 

Please be aware that communications over the Internet, such as emails/webmails, are not secure unless they have been encrypted.

Your communications may route through a number of countries before being delivered - this is the nature of the World Wide Web/Internet. We cannot accept responsibility for any unauthorised access or loss of personal information that is beyond our control.

It may be necessary to transfer your personal information to other Group companies or service providers located in countries outside of the EEA**. This may happen where our servers or suppliers and service providers are based outside of the EEA or where you use our services and products while visiting countries outside of the EEA. The data protection and other laws of these countries may not be as comprehensive as those in the UK or the EU - in these instances we will take steps to ensure that your privacy rights are respected.

** The European Economic Area (EEA) currently comprises the Member states of the European Union plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein
