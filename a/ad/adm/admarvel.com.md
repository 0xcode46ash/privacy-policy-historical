TECHNOLOGY PRIVACY POLICY
AdMarvel provides an advertising platform and advertising mediation service to
interconnect mobile publishers with multiple ad sources. Our Technology
facilitates the efficient serving of advertisements within mobile messages (e.g.
SMS) the mobile web and within mobile applications by collecting information
associated with these services that you visit or use and the advertisements that
you see associated with such services. You may encounter our technology when
                                                                                       5


AdMarvel or one of our Business Partners places advertisements on a mobile
web site or application that you visit or use. We use the information collected by
our technology in order to help us efficiently deliver those ads, and for reporting
purposes (e.g., to tell our partners how many ads we delivered in a day.)
      Ways we collect information
       AdMarvel does not collect personal information directly from individuals
       but rather receives information via partners’ mobile messages, mobile web
       sites and mobile applications as well as from third party service providers
       (e.g., mobile carrier operators). In this light, AdMarvel relies on our
       customer partners and these third party service providers to inform their
       users about the purposes for which it collects and uses their personal
       information. To the best of our ability we inform our partners the need to
       offer individuals the opportunity to choose (opt-out) whether their personal
       information is (a) to be disclosed to a non-agent third party, or (b) to be
       used for a purpose other than the purpose for which it was originally
       collected or subsequently authorized by the individual. Consistent with the
       U.S. Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA), we will
       never knowingly collect personally identifiable information from anyone
       under the age of thirteen (13) without requiring parental consent. When
       AdMarvel receives personal information from the entities described above
       (in the EU, Switzerland or elsewhere), we will use such information only in
       accordance with the principles set forth here, the notices such entities
       provided and the choices made by the individuals to whom such personal
       information relates.
       When our customer partner’s end users connect to the technical service
       on their mobile device, AdMarvel may automatically receive from their
       mobile phone service provider or our customer partner information
       identifying the user’s unique mobile device, their phone number and/or
       other unique identifiers for their device (“Mobile Device Information”). For
       the avoidance of doubt, end users are not “Users” covered by this Privacy
       Policy, and any private information that we collect from the end users is
       governed by the customer partner or mobile phone service provider
       privacy policies, if any, and not this Privacy Policy.
       AdMarvel does use a “pixel tags" and/or similar technologies, in our
       communications to enable us to evaluate when and if advertisements are
       viewable on the mobile device. A pixel tag is typically a one-pixel,
       transparent image (although it can be a visible image as well), located
       within the advertising creative, which is retrieved from a remote site on the
       Internet enabling the verification of an individual's viewing or receipt of a
       Web page or message.
      What information is collected by our Technology and how is it used?
                                                                                     6


    While AdMarvel does not store or maintain personal Information via our
    technology, our technology does collect and use Non-PII, including:
    location and service provider information garnered via the IP address used
    to access the mobile Internet or other means, device identifiers, the type
    of phone or other mobile device used (e.g., iPhone, Blackberry 8800 etc.),
    the date and time of a user’s mobile internet session, whether one of the
    mobile ads we facilitate was delivered and, if applicable, a record if that ad
    was “clicked.”
    AdMarvel on occasion receives personal information for processing but
    does not retain that information in an identifiable form. Specifically,
    AdMarvel, may receive users’ telephone numbers if the mobile operator
    facilitates the delivery of that number to our partner customer. In those
    cases AdMarvel will transmit the number through to the partner customer
    on the behalf of the mobile carrier operator. In a similar manner AdMarvel
    may receive IP addresses of users but does not retain the full set of IP
    address octets after processing.
    AdMarvel uses the collected information to analyze usage trends and
    patterns that will enable the efficient delivery of optimized advertising
    placements on behalf of our business partners. Our technology also uses
    the information to provide reports and measurement analytics to our
    business partners. We may also aggregate this performance information
    and share it with AdMarvel's affiliates, advertisers, customers and
    Business Partners.
