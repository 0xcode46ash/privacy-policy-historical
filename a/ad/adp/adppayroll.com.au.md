# Privacy

**Application of this Policy**

Automatic Data Processing Limited ABN 70 003 924 945 (ADP) is committed to complying with the requirements of the Privacy Act 1988 as amended from time to time ("Act"). The core requirements of the Act are set out in the National Privacy Principles ("NPPs"). The NPPs set out how an organisation such as ADP should collect, use, keep, secure, and disclose personal information. The NPPs also give individuals a right to know what information an organisation holds about him or her, and a right to correct it if it is wrong. 

ADP's Australian Privacy Statement sets out ADP's policy in Australia for handling personal information collected when dealing with its clients and business partners. 

From time to time, ADP may change its privacy statement. For example, as ADP updates and improves its service, new features might require modifications to the statement ADP may publish these changes on its websites at www.adppayroll.com.au and www.payline.com.au 

**What personal information does ADP collect?**

"Personal Information" is any information or opinion from which an individual's identity can be ascertained. ADP collects only the information necessary to provide its services. ADP generally collects personal information such as an individual's name, address, e-mail address, user ID, banking details, date of birth, payroll details, and employment-related information such as salary details, superannuation contributions, Tax File Number, and PAYG withholding tax. 

In most situations, ADP collects personal information about an individual directly from the ADP client who is employing the individual. Where ADP is provided with personal information by its clients, it relies on its clients having obtained the consent of the individual for the collection, use, and disclosure of his or her personal information to and by ADP. It also relies on its client's drawing the points set out in this statement to the individual's attention. 

**Why does ADP collect and use personal information?**

ADP collects and uses personal information for a number of purposes, such as: 

  * Providing payroll services 

  * Billing and account management 

  * Internal business operations such as planning, product development, research, and reporting to ADP-related companies 

  * Advising clients of functions and product launches 

  * Providing direct market offers for products and services provided by or on behalf of ADP (or other organisations), which ADP considers to be of interest to its clients




ADP does not collect personal information prior to obtaining the consent of its clients or of the individual(s) involved.

**Disclosure of personal information**

We do not sell or rent Personal Data collected through this site to anyone. ADP uses Salesforce.com as a client contact information management system which allows ADP to register contact details of clients and prospects. A limited number of authorized users from the Sales department will have access to the database on a need to know basis, in order to search for business information related to both clients and prospects.  Your data will then be hosted by SalesForce.com in the United States. Salesforce.com adheres to the US-EU Safe Harbor Privacy Principles (“Safe Harbor”).  This means that Salesforce.com protects personal information about data subjects that it receives in the United States in accordance with the Safe Harbor requirements. Further information about Safe Harbor can be found on the US Department of Commerce at <http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/>.

ADP may also provide aggregate statistics about visitors to our sites, such as volume, traffic patterns, and related site information to reputable third-party vendors, but these statistics will include no Personal Data. ADP may also disclose information in special cases when we have a good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to legal requirements or comply with legal process; (b) protect and defend our rights or property; (c) enforce the Web site Terms and Conditions of Use; or (d) act to protect the rights of our users or others.

ADP, in using personal information for the above purposes, might need to disclose personal information to various organisations and/or parties, such as the Australian Taxation Office, banking/financial institutions, superannuation authorities, health insurance organisations, contracted service providers, business partners, and related companies of ADP. 

In some instances, ADP may need to disclose personal information to organisations and/or parties in a foreign country where, for example, this disclosure (or transfer) of personal information is necessary for the conclusion or performance of contracted services in the interests of individuals, between ADP and its clients. 

ADP may also disclose information in special cases when ADP believes, in good faith, that such action is reasonably necessary, for example: (a) to conform to legal requirements or comply with legal process; (b) to protect and defend ADP's rights or property; (c) to enforce ADP's contractual arrangements; or (d) to protect the interests of ADP's clients or others. 

**How Does ADP protect personal information?**

We protect your Personal Data by using industry standard techniques such as firewalls, encryption, intrusion detection and site monitoring. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your Personal Data, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or receive from us. This is especially true for information you transmit to us via e-mail. We have no way of protecting that information until it reaches us. Once we receive your transmission, we make our best effort to ensure its security on our servers. Internally, we will restrict access to your Personal Data to employees who need access to the information in order to do their jobs. These employees are limited in number, and are committed to our privacy policies. Additionally, we will never ask you for your password in an unsolicited phone call or in an unsolicited e-mail. 

We will review our security arrangements from time to time as we deem appropriate.

Some ADP sites, like many other commercial web sites, may utilize a standard technology called "cookies" to collect information about how our site is used. Cookies were designed to help a web site operator determine that a particular user had visited the site previously and thus save and remember any preferences that may have been set while the user was browsing the site. Cookies are small strings of text that web sites can send to your browser. Cookies cannot retrieve any other data from your hard drive or obtain your e-mail address. If you are simply browsing an ADP informational site, a cookie may be used to identify your browser as one that has visited the site before. 

We may also make use of memory-based cookies in support of authenticating the user of certain ADP web applications. Similarly, if you are a registered user of a site providing service to ADP’s clients (and have a user ID and password), we may use cookies so that we can provide personalized information based on preferences you have indicated while using the site. You have the ability to modify your browser to either accept all cookies, notify you when a cookie is sent, or reject all cookies.
