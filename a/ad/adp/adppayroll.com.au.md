# ADP - Privacy

**The New Privacy Laws**

From 21 December 2001, Automatic Data Processing Limited ABN 70 003 924 945 ("ADP") will need to comply with the requirements of the Privacy Act 1988 as amended from time to time ("the Act"). 

The core requirements of the Act are set out in the National Privacy Principles ("NPPs"). The NPPs set out how an organisation, such as ADP should collect, use, keep, secure and disclose personal information. The NPPs also give individuals a right to know what information an organisation holds about him or her and a right to correct it if it is wrong. 

**Application of this Policy**

ADP is committed to complying with the requirements of the Act. This statement sets out ADP's policy in Australia for handling personal information collected when dealing with its clients and business partners. 

From time to time, ADP may change this Australian Privacy Statement. For example, as we update and improve our service, new features may require modifications to this statement. ADP may publish these changes on its websites at [www.asiapacific.adp.com](http://www.asiapacific.adp.com/) & [www.payline.com.au](http://www.payline.com.au/). 

**What personal information does ADP collect?**

"Personal Information" is any information or opinion from which an individual's identity may be ascertained. ADP only collects information that is necessary to assist us in providing our services. ADP generally collects personal information such as an individual's name, address, e-mail address, user ID, banking details, date of birth, payroll details and other employment related information such as salary details, superannuation contributions, Tax File Number and PAYG withholding tax. 

In most situations ADP collects personal information about individuals directly from ADP clients who are the individual's employer. Where ADP is provided with personal information by it's clients, it relies on it's clients having obtained the consent of those individuals to the collection, use and disclosure of his or her personal information to and by ADP. It also relies on its clients drawing the points set out in this statement to the individuals attention. 

**Why does ADP collect and use personal information?**

ADP does not collect personal information unless it first asks it's clients or the individual for it. 

ADP collects and uses personal information for a number of purposes such as for: 

> • | providing payroll services;  
> ---|---  
> • | account management and billing;  
> • | internal business operation such as planning, product development, research and reporting to ADP related companies;  
> • | advising clients of functions/product launches  
> • | providing direct market offers such as products and services provided by or on behalf of ADP (or other organisations) which we consider may be of interest to our clients.  
  
  
**Disclosure of Personal Information**

ADP, in using personal information for the above purposes, may need to disclose personal information to various organisations and/or parties such as the Australian Taxation Office, banking/financial institutions, superannuation authorities, health insurance organisations, contracted service providers, business partners and related companies of ADP. 

In some instances, ADP may need to disclose personal information to organisations and/or parties in a foreign country where, for example, this disclosure (or transfer) of personal information is necessary for the conclusion or performance of contracted services in the interests of individuals, between ADP and its clients. 

ADP may also disclose information in special cases when ADP have a good faith belief that such action is reasonably necessary to, for example, (a) conform to legal requirements or comply with legal process; (b) protect and defend ADP rights or property; (c) enforce ADP's contractual arrangements; or (d) act to protect the interests of ADP's clients or others. 

**How does ADP protect personal information?**

ADP exercises great care to protect personal information which we hold. This includes, among other things, using industry standard techniques such as firewalls, encryption, intrusion detection and site monitoring. 

Internally, ADP restricts access to personal information to employees or parties who need access to the information in order to do their jobs. These employees or parties are limited in number, and are committed to maintaining confidentiality. 

ADP will review security arrangements from time to time as we deem appropriate. 

**How can you help protect your information?**

If you are providing personal information to ADP (or receiving it from ADP), ADP requests that you take all necessary steps to ensure that it is accurate, complete and up to date. 

**How can you correct, access, and update your information?**

An individual may view his or her personal information at any time (subject to the Act) and tell us if he or she believes the information is incorrect by contacting us using the contact details provided below. 

**What to do if you have a complaint?**

Any complaint regarding a possible breach of privacy by ADP should be directed to ADP's Privacy Officer at the following address:
