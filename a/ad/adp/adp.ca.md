**Does the ADP Canada Site collect personal information from you using technology?**   
The ADP Canada Site collects information from you using technology, so it may not be readily apparent to you that it is being collected.  Specifically, we use cookies (small strings of text that are stored on your computer) to collect information about how you enter (e.g. through a link from a 3rd party site) and navigate the ADP Canada Site, and what information was of interest to you.  We use this knowledge to improve the information and services we offer on the ADP Canada Site.  In general, the cookies we use do not identify you by name.  Instead, the cookies we use identify each visitor by the number associated with the computer or device they use to access the Internet (i.e., the Internet Protocol (IP) Address). Such cookies cannot retrieve any other information from your hard drive or obtain your email address without your knowledge.

We may also make use of memory-based cookies to assist in authenticating you as a registered user of certain ADP Canada web applications.  If you are a registered user (meaning that you have a user ID and password to access one of our web applications), we may use memory-based cookies to remember any preferences you set during a previous use of the application in order to provide you with more direct services based on these preferences when you use the application in the future.

**Do you have to disclose personal information to us to use the ADP Canada Site?**   
We generally do not require you to disclose your personal information to us in order to access, to surf or to view the content on the ADP Canada Site.  You can always choose not to provide your personal information to us, although this may prevent us from fulfilling a particular transaction that you have requested.  For example, we cannot contact you to provide you with information you have requested if you refuse to provide us with your contact information.

We do not sell or rent the personal information collected through the ADP Canada Site to any third party to use or disclose for its own marketing purposes.  We may share this information with service providers that we have contracted with to perform services on our behalf, such as data storage, data processing and information technology support, but these service providers are contractually required by us not to use or disclose this information except as necessary to perform services on our behalf or to comply with legal requirements.  We may also share this information in circumstances where we hold a good faith belief that such disclosure is necessary to (a) conform to legal requirements or comply with legal process; (b) protect and defend our rights or property; or (c) act to protect the safety and security of our guests and our site.

The security of the personal information collected through the ADP Canada Site is of utmost importance to us.  We have implemented technical, contractual, administrative and physical security measures to protect the personal information collected from you on the ADP Canada Site with a level of security appropriate to the sensitivity of the personal information collected.  This may include, among other things, using industry standard techniques such as firewalls, encryption, intrusion detection and site monitoring.

Internally, we restrict access to your personal information to employees and service providers who need access to this information in order to fulfil the purposes identified to you at the time of collection, or who are permitted by law to have such access.  These employees and service providers are limited in number, and are committed to, and have agreed to be bound by, our high standards of privacy protection.

If you are using an ADP Canada web program for which you registered and chose a password, we strongly recommend that you do not reveal your password to anyone.  Please note that we will never ask you for your password in an unsolicited phone call or in an unsolicited email.  In addition, please remember to sign out of the program for which you registered and to close your browser window when you have finished your work, in order to help ensure that other individuals with access to your computer cannot view and retrieve your personal information.

We will review and amend our security measures periodically, as we deem appropriate.
