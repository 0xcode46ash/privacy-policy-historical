# Adperk >> AdPerk™ Privacy Policy

**  
**

**IMPORTANT: The policies below are applicable to www.adperk.com and/or other sites on the World Wide Web portion of the Internet owned and operated by Reduce My Fee, LLC.**

**Reduce My Fee, LLC collects personally identifying information during participation and/or registration in the course of providing information and services through www.adperk.com and related sites (the "AdPerk™" program), and this information is used from time to time as you use our Website to, among other things: confirm registration information; award credits; selectively offer you advertisements to choose from; offer or send you promotions or offers from us or our advertisers; and similar contacts.   AdPerk™ participants’ email addresses and other personal information are kept in secure databases to protect our members’ and participants’ privacy. Guests under 18 years of age may not, depending on current or future policy of AdPerk™ or its publishers or advertisers, be allowed to participate in AdPerk™ or other offers from or through Reduce My Fee, LLC.**

**All registrants receive email confirming their registration and participation in AdPerk™, along with other items relative to the AdPerk™ platform; from time to time you may receive other sponsored advertising messages from or through AdPerk™ but we will not sell or divulge your personal information without your consent. You may at any time modify your registration with Reduce My Fee, LLC and/or AdPerk™ by editing your profile via Internet access prescribed by Reduce My Fee, LLC and/or AdPerk™.**

**Each email we send you and/or Terms of Service may include a description of the simple unsubscribe process to enable you to stop receiving future email of that type from Reduce My Fee, LLC and/or AdPerk™.   You may unsubscribe from each such email type this way. For example, unsubscribing from a recurring AdPerk™ account status email, if any, will result in you no longer receiving such account status email.  You may however continue to receive other types of email, which you can unsubscribe from in the same fashion.**

**If you wish to stop receiving email results from Reduce My Fee, LLC and/or AdPerk™, you may quickly and easily unsubscribe yourself. If you register, enroll, or otherwise participate in AdPerk™ subsequent to unsubscribing from all emails, you are giving Reduce My Fee, LLC and/or AdPerk™ authorization and direction to re-subscribe you to all mail types, and your receiving email results and other promotions may be automatically reinstated. Your reward notifications and other account information or AdPerk™ related information might be sent via email. Furthermore, you hereby authorize and agree to receive messages from advertisers participating in the AdPerk™ program, regardless of whether or not you’ve actually viewed such advertisers’ advertisements.   You may, however, opt out of such notifications. **

**About IP Addresses**

**Reduce My Fee, LLC may collect IP addresses for the purposes of system administration and to report aggregate information to our advertisers and, in certain circumstances, other third parties. This information may also used in your welcome email to confirm that, in fact, you have registered for AdPerk™ and will be used in the event that you dispute registration. In some cases, an IP address is specific to your computer. In other cases, an IP address is randomly assigned with a block of IP addresses, which are assigned by your ISP (internet service provider) each time you log on.**

**An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your ISP server. Web servers generally automatically identify your ISP by its IP address.**

**When you request pages from AdPerk™ or Reduce My Fee, LLC, our servers may log and record your IP address.**

**About Cookies**

**Cookies are small pieces of information that a website transfers to an individual's hard drive for record-keeping purposes. Cookies make your online experience easier by saving your registration, passwords, and references while you're at a website. The use of cookies is an industry standard-- you'll find them at most major websites.**

**Through cookies, our server may determine whether or not you have already registered for AdPerk™. Cookies help our server to know you are participating, so that you don't necessarily need to register each time you participate.**

**Cookies also help us to serve you better. Through the use of cookies we can better understand what information interests you, providing more of what you like and want from your experience with Reduce My Fee, LLC, AdPerk™, and our advertisers.**

**Some examples of how we use cookies:**

**A cookie lets our computers remember that you've registered, which allows us to speed up your future activities at our sites. Similarly, the cookie tracks which of our sponsors or advertisements you've visited so that we may constantly introduce you to new and interesting sponsors and information. Reduce My Fee, LLC may use information we collect through cookies for promotional or marketing purposes. Use of cookies to do the record keeping saves you the trouble of entering information over and over again. If you decline cookies, you may adversely impact your AdPerk experience. We make our cookies available on an anonymous basis to other advertisers and advertising networks so that they can serve you ads for products you are interested in. For example if you expressed interest in buying a new car you may receive ads about cars. However, we DO NOT include personally identifiable information with the cookies.**

**What our cookies don't do:**

**We DO NOT use cookies to retrieve information from your computer that was not originally provided by you or provided by your browser in a visit to any website of AdPerk™ or Reduce My Fee, LLC.**

**We do not use cookies to track other sites that you visit on the Internet.**

**You may get cookies from our advertisers if you visit their websites. Reduce My Fee, LLC and AdPerk™ do not control these cookies, and these cookies are not subject to the Reduce My Fee, LLC cookies policy. The use of advertising cookies sent by third-party servers is standard on the Internet. As mentioned above, we share non-personally identifiable information with third party ad serving partners so they may bring you targeted offers. This information can be associated with their cookies but will not include personally identifiable information such as your name or address. You may review our advertisers' privacy policies when visiting their sites.**

**By using any Reduce My Fee, LLC owned and operated websites, including www.adperk.com, you are agreeing to the terms herein, as well as the Terms of Service. If you do not agree to the Policy as described herein, please do not use our websites. We reserve the right, at our discretion, to change, modify, add, or remove portions of this Policy at any time.
