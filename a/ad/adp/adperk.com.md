# Adperk >> AdPerk™ Privacy Policy

| **AdPerk Privacy Policy Highlights**

AdPerk recognizes the importance of privacy. The following highlights our Privacy Policy, particularly the personal information we receive or collect when you use AdPerk. We hope this will help you make an informed decision about sharing personal information with us. 

AdPerk will never sell or share your personally identifiable information (such as name, address or email) with any third-party without your agreement or consent. Certain personal data is an essential component of AdPerk participation. For example, your mailing address is necessary to send subscriptions or other rewards obtained through the use of the AdPerk platform. Similarly, your email address is required as part of the AdPerk registration process so we may communicate important information about your account and the AdPerk program, or so we, or our partners permitted by you, may provide updates, make special offers or deliver electronic rewards. 

Unsubscribe or cancel your account whenever you like. We’ll periodically send you updates on news, rewards and offers. Please reference our [Terms of Service](http://www.adperk.com/terms_of_service.php) for more information on how to unsubscribe or cancel your account.

This Policy applies to all the services, products or Websites offered or operated by AdPerk or its corporate entity Reduce My Fee, LLC. 

We’re committed to making your AdPerk experience as enjoyable as possible, both on our site and afterwards. Outlined below are details on the information we collect and how we use it:

  1. **Information you provide.** AdPerk collects demographic and/or personally identifiable information (such as name, email address, mailing address and account password) during registration and/or in the course of providing information and services through AdPerk. This information is stored in a secure database to protect user privacy. In some cases, AdPerk may report aggregate information to our Advertisers and Publishers (as those terms are defined in our [Terms of Service](http://www.adperk.com/terms_of_service.php)) and, in certain circumstances, other third-parties.
  2. **AdPerk cookies.** When you visit AdPerk, we send one or more cookies (a small file containing a string of characters) to your computer that uniquely identifies your browser. We use cookies to validate your login session and to better understand your interests and preferences so we can provide products, offers and services most relevant to you. We will never sell or share personally identifiable information obtained from cookies. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, but you can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some AdPerk features and services may not function properly if cookies are disabled. 
  3. **User communications (from you to AdPerk).** If you send email or other communication to AdPerk, we may retain such communications in order to process your inquiries, respond to your requests and improve our services.
  4. **AdPerk communications (from AdPerk to you).** All registrants receive an email confirming their registration and participation in AdPerk.

If you choose to opt out of these communications, you will not receive important information about the AdPerk program, your account or reward. 
  5. **AdPerk partners.** AdPerk offers some services or rewards in connection with third-parties or other Websites. In registering with AdPerk, you agree that Publishers or companies whose goods or services you obtain or attempt to obtain through AdPerk, may contact you by email or ground mail (for example, you may receive communications from publishers of magazines you earn through AdPerk); however, we will not sell or divulge your personal information to Advertisers or other third-parties without your consent. 
  6. **Links and other sites.** AdPerk may present links to our partners, Publishers and Advertisers, in a format that enables us to keep track whether these links are followed.
