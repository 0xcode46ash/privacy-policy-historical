Privacy Policy  
**  
  
---  
  
adpasar privacy policy and practices are detailed below, and we ask you to read them thoroughly. We are constantly improving the tools you can use to manage the data that you provide to us. Please refer to this page from time to time to see these new features.  
  
** Coverage**  
  
  
This policy applies to this site only and our affiliates have their own privacy policy statements, which we encourage you to read whenever you visit their sites. When we talk about "adpasar" or "we" in this policy, we are referring to Company and its majority-owned or majority-controlled subsidiaries.  
  
** Helpful Definitions**  
  
  
Personally identifiable information is information such as your name, birth date, e-mail address or mailing address that can be used to uniquely identify you.

Anonymous Information is not personally identifiable information. Anonymous information is information about how you use our site (such as places visited and search queries performed). Anonymous information also includes the domain names and/or I.P. addresses (as explained in greater detail below) of browsers that visit our site, time of day the site was visited, and other non-personally identifiable information. Anonymous information is information that is not tied to any individual, but helps to characterize the usage pattern.

The next sections tell how and when we collects anonymous information and personally identifiable information.  
  
** Collection and Use of Personally Identifiable Information**  
  
_  
Signing up as member_

We want to assure you that you can visit our site and use many of our services without telling us who you are or revealing any personally identifiable information about yourself to us. **_It is only during registration to become a registered user will you be asked to provide us with personally identifiable information._**

Although many of our services do not require any form of customer registration, we do require registration for the use of certain services, such as participating in the online auction. During this registration process we require you to complete certain fields, offer optional fields for you to complete, and ask you to select a user name and password. For example, we ask for contact information (such as first and last name, email address, and postal code). We use this contact information in several ways: 

  * to welcome you to the adpasar Network 

  * to send communications from us about new features and services available through adpasar  

  * to display advertisements on your screen that closely match your interests 

  * to provide a first and last name on messages sent from your adpasar email account 

  * to share your information with select sponsors and partners who work with adpasar, only if you allow us to do so (as we explain below) 

  * to allow our sponsors and partners to communicate with you, but only if you tell us you want to receive these communications about their services and offers




We will remember your preferences indicated to us during registration and we will respect them at all time. If you already are a registered user and would like to review or change the choices you have made, you will be able to do so under the account setting.  


_Contests, Etc._

From time to time, we may run contests on our site in which we ask participants for contact information, such as their email address(es). If you participate in contests, your contact information will be used to reach you in connection with the contests. We may also use the collected contact information to send you information about our services, as well as offers tailored to your interests by our advertisers and sponsors. You may choose to opt-out of receiving such mailings at the time of registration for the contest, or afterwards.

  
  
** Sharing Limited Contact Information Between Users**  
  
To ensure smooth transactions between our members, it is adpasar's policy for members to provide a valid contact information on file at our system at all time. In the event that your primary contact information is outdated or invalid, or you have failed to respond to member's request to complete a transaction, or in such cases deemed appropriate by us, we may provide your contact number to member from the other side who have entered into a purchase contract with you via our system.

Please be assured that only minimum contact information is involved (ie. phone number) in this scenario in order to re-establish communication between you and the other member so that outstanding contract can be executed successfully.  
  
** Sharing Personally Identifiable Information with Third Parties**  
  
  
To deliver advertising to you that most closely matches your interests, we share your personal information with carefully selected companies with whom we have relationships and trust. Our partners who receive information from us have the right to use the data we provide them (sometimes, in connection with other information they may have gathered about you), but are generally prohibited from sharing this information with other companies or people. 

**PLEASE NOTE:** In certain special cases, we may disclose your personally identifiable information when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to you, or otherwise injuring or interfering with our rights, property or operations, other adpasar users, or anyone else who could be harmed by such activities. We may also disclose your personally identifiable information when we believe the law requires it, or in response to any demand by law enforcement authorities in connection with a criminal investigation, or civil or administrative authorities in connection with a pending civil case or administrative investigation.  
  
** Anonymous Information**  
  
  
When you use our site, we collect anonymous information, even if you have not registered with us. We use this information to personalize your experience at our site, show you more relevant advertising messages, and generally to improve our services. We share this anonymous information with selected advertisers and partners, in order to deliver to you more relevant advertising messages.

We will not share any anonymous information about your use on our site if that information is or will be linked to your personally identifiable information unless we have given you notice as described above and you have given us authorization to do so.  
  
   
** Use of IP Addresses**  
  
An Internet protocol (I.P.) address is a set of numbers that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you log on to your internet service provider or through your company's local area network (LAN) or wide area network (WAN). Web servers - the powerful computers that provide web pages for viewing - automatically identify your computer by the IP address assigned to it during your session online.

We may collect I.P. addresses for purposes of system administration, to report anonymous user information to our advertisers (as explained above), to bring more relevant and better services to you, and to audit the use of our site.

We can and will use I.P. addresses to identify users of our site when we feel it is necessary to enforce compliance with our site's terms of use or terms of service, or to protect our service, site, or other users.

**PLEASE NOTE:** Under certain circumstances, I.P. addresses and/or domain names may be linked to personally identifiable information, when said information is stored in databases managed by Internet registrars or registries.  
  
** Keyword Search & Browsing of Results**  
  
Certain advertisers have paid for the right to display advertisements on search results pages corresponding to certain words. For instance, a particular resistor manufacturer may want its advertisement to be displayed when users search for its resistor. Other than this, there may also be others creative ways offered to our advertisers as well.

To provide a better advertising features, we have the right to control how the browsing & search results are displayed, organized, and in any sequence deemed fit to us.   
  
** Third-Party Relationships**  
  
  
In order to provide you with news and features that match your interests, adpasar has relationships with many of the best media and services companies in the market. You can recognize these sites by the joint branding of adpasar and such companies. For example, if you see a logo in the upper-right corner of the page that says 'Powered by adpasar', you will know you are on a co-branded Web page. If you ever have any questions about whether certain information, content or services pertain to us, or are "powered by" one of our partners, please contact us to verify.

Whenever you provide registration information on certain co-branded Web pages or for certain services provided in conjunction with third party partners, you should make every effort to read the privacy policies provided by or in association with such third parties, and make an informed decision on your own whether or not to continue utilizing the services based upon the privacy policies posted on these co-branded Web pages, at your own discretion.

In addition to finding co-branded Web pages, you will find direct links on adpasar to the sites offered by third parties. Some of these sites are authorized to use the adpasar brand and/or logo. Again, you should read these third party privacy policies, and make an informed decision on your own as to whether or not to continue based upon these sites' privacy practices, at your own discretion. No third-party sites are covered by this Privacy Policy.

**VERY IMPORTANT:** If you feel that a site using the adpasar brand and/or logo has not posted an acceptable privacy policy, or is not following the privacy policy it has posted, please inform us promptly. We will forward complaints to the appropriate third parties to ensure that your concerns are adequately handled. Of course, if any of these third party companies does not have a privacy policy that is acceptable to you, you should refrain from providing information until your concerns have been satisfactorily addressed.

  


  
  
** Security**  
  
  
We operate secure data networks protected by industry standard technology that includes but not limited to firewall, password protection and encrypted channel for our services. We have security measures in place to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of the data under our control.

Only authorized employees have access to the information you provide us. For example, we impose strict rules on adpasar employees who have access either to the databases that store user information or to the servers that host our services. While we cannot guarantee that loss, misuse or alteration to data will not occur, we make every effort (such as the use of employee passwords and non-disclosure agreements) to prevent such unfortunate occurrences.
