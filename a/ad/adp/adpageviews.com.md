# Ad Page Views : Privacy Policy

What information do you collect?

We'll collect your sponsor's username, Your name, physical address, email address, IP address, and payment processor details.

How will your information be used?

Your information will only be used to be able to conduct business with you, provide you service, send earnings to you, and for security purposes (detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues).

How will my information be shared?

Your information will never be sold, published, nor shared. We may be required by law to provide your information to law enforcement, regulators, or other legal processes enforceable by government request.

Transparency and choice

Our AdPages give you the ability to list your phone number, email, and physical address. This is transparent, and you're given the choice to display this on your free ad page if you wish.

How do we protect your information?

Great lengths have been taken to ensure the security of our site, and your information.

Accessing and updating your personal information

Inside your member account, you'll be able to edit your personal details at any time.

How can users further protect their information?

Make sure you use 2 or more anti-virus programs, malware, and spyware removal software. The more you use, the better. Keylogging is the #1 method for gaining access to your username and password, which would thus provide access to your account information.

Do we use cookies?

No, we use a system called "session" instead, which is cleared when you close your browser window.

Third party links

The very nature of our business is to drive traffic to third party sites. We take no responsibility for the content on their pages, nor privacy policies they contain.
