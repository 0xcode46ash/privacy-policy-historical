AdParlor collects user submitted information such as name, email and password data to authenticate users, authenticate its commercial users, (AdParlor accounts and account services are available only to advertisers; they are not available to consumers), and to send notifications to those users relating to the AdParlor service. This information is not shared to anyone and is used by AdParlor so we can customize your experience and protect the security of your account.  
We may also use a user’s email address to send updates, a newsletter or news regarding  
Adparlor’s services.

AdParlor may also collect information from business partners, such as advertisers and agencies, on AdParlor’s website or self-service product offerings as necessary to provide services to those business partners.  This may include, but is not limited to, names, email addresses, phone numbers, physical addresses, and other information provided by business partners to AdParlor through such a website or product offering (“Business Information”).  Such information may be used and shared as necessary to perform AdParlor’s services for those business partners.

AdParlor logs IP address, date/time stamp, aggregate user data, and browser type, from users and visitors to its sites.  This data is used to manage the websites, track usage and improve the website services.  This non-personally-identifiable information may be shared with third-parties to provide more relevant services and advertisements to AdParlor’s account holders.  User IP addresses are recorded for security and monitoring purposes.

We may use cookies when you use our services.  In addition, AdParlor uses cookies in connection with consumers visiting the web pages of social media sites where we provide services to our account holders; however, the data we collect in connection with consumers is used for tracking clicks and conversions. Advertisers or other parties using our Services may use cookies or other means to track consumers over time across different websites.  The use of such information collected by other parties is covered by those parties’ respective privacy policies.  Cookies are small text files that are placed on your computer’s hard drive by our servers to identify your computer to our servers.

Adparlor and/or its partners reserve their rights to use cookies to track individual responses or views of advertisements, and use this information to help predict what other advertisements may be of interest to consumers and enable the receipt of customized advertisements or content. These cookies contain no personally identifiable information. The cookies may reflect de-identified demographic or other data linked to data you voluntarily have submitted to us, such as your email address, that we may share with any third party, solely in hashed, non-human readable form. To learn about how you can opt-out of the receipt of cookies, please visit _<http://www.aboutads.info/choices>_ and to learn more about cookies in general, please visit [http://www.cookiecentral.com](http://www.cookiecentral.com/).  AdParlor does not have a mechanism or process to respond to any “do not track” signals which a web browser may send or receive.

We do not knowingly collect information about minors under the age of 18.  MINORS UNDER THE AGE OF 18 SHOULD NOT PROVIDE OR SUBMIT ANY PERSONAL INFORMATION, INCLUDING THEIR EMAIL ADDRESS, TO ADPARLOR.  If Adparlor is notified it has information about a minor under the age of 18, that information will be promptly deleted from our database.  Minors are not permitted to open accounts with Adparlor.

**Use of Information and User Data**

_How we use and share the information we collect._

Except as otherwise described in this privacy policy, AdParlor will not disclose personal information to any third party unless we believe that disclosure is necessary: (1) to conform to legal requirements or to respond to a subpoena, search warrant or other legal process received by AdParlor, whether or not a response is required by applicable law; (2) to enforce the AdParlor Terms of Use Agreement or to protect our rights; or (3) to protect the safety of members of the public and users of the service.

AdParlor reserves the right to transfer personal information to a successor in interest that acquires rights to that information as a result of the sale of AdParlor or substantially all of its assets to that successor in interest.
