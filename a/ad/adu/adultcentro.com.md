Privacy Policy  
This Privacy Policy covers LikeWhoa Inc.'s ("LikeWhoa") treatment of personally identifiable information that LikeWhoa collects when you are on the LikeWhoa and AdultCentro.com Websites and when you use LikeWhoa's services. It is important that visitors are fully informed about the use of their personal information. LikeWhoa believes in 100% permission-based marketing. For each visitor to our Websites, our Web server automatically recognizes only the consumer's domain name, but not the e-mail address (unless requested and supplied by the consumer as a registration field entry). 

Registration is required to use services provided and managed by LikeWhoa (e.g. AdultCentro). This Privacy Policy also applies to consumers that have agreed to receive e-mail marketing from LikeWhoa, whether at our Websites, via email, on third party websites or otherwise. We collect information in certain portions of our Websites, where guests provide content submissions and suggestions or participate in interactive online activities (i.e., by way of responding to questions and surveys, community listings, ratings, searches and comparison searches, bidding, purchasing, sweepstakes, or bulletin boards, etc.). The personal profile information you submit to LikeWhoa remains your property, but by submitting that information to LikeWhoa, you grant LikeWhoa the right to use that information for marketing purposes. LikeWhoa may also use such information to fulfill prizes, track compliance with our Rules, or for content improvement and feedback purposes. We may sell the personal information that you supply to us and we may join together with other businesses to bring selected retail opportunities to our members. In addition, LikeWhoa reserves the right to release current or past member information in the event LikeWhoa believes that the membership is being or has been used in violation of the Rules or to commit unlawful acts, if the information is subpoenaed, if LikeWhoa is sold or acquired, or when LikeWhoa deems it necessary or appropriate. By agreeing to these terms, you hereby consent to disclosure of any record or communication to any third party, including law enforcement or under subpoena, when LikeWhoa, in its sole discretion, determines the disclosure to be appropriate.

LikeWhoa reserves the right to provide "aggregate" or "group" data about LikeWhoa users for lawful purposes. "Aggregate" or "Group" data is data that describes the demographics, usage, or characteristics of LikeWhoa participants as a group. By Registering with LikeWhoa, you agree to allow LikeWhoa to provide such aggregate data to third parties.

No one under the age of 21 is permitted to register at LikeWhoa's AdultCentro.com Website. Registration with LikeWhoa is void where prohibited by law, rule or regulation. All federal, state and local laws and regulations apply.

Registrants may receive e-mail confirming their Registration and subsequent entries in our sweepstakes, as well as promotional marketing of commercial products and services. If you do not want to receive e-mail from us in the future, please let us know by e-mailing us at the following address: (unsubscribe@LikeWhoa.com).

LikeWhoa does not endorse, nor is LikeWhoa responsible for the accuracy of, the Privacy Policies and/or Terms and Conditions of each of the advertisers on the LikeWhoa.com and AdultCentro.com Websites. The entities which advertise and place banner ads on the LikeWhoa.com and AdultCentro.com Websites are independent third parties and are not affiliated with LikeWhoa.

**Your Acceptance of These Terms**  
By using this site and/or agreeing to receive information from LikeWhoa, you agree to the LikeWhoa Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to the terms of this policy, please do not use our Websites. We reserve the right, at our discretion, to change, modify, add, or remove portions of this policy at any time. All Privacy Policy changes will take effect immediately upon their posting on the Websites. Please check this page periodically for changes. Your continued use of the LikeWhoa.com and AdultCentro.com Websites following the posting of changes to these terms will mean that you accept these changes.
