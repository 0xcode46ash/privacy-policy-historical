# Privacy | AdRoll

Want to see spammy ads for mortgages, life Insurance, and long lost classmates?

Neither do we. That's why we're working with businesses to present ads that are useful for you. The companies that AdRoll works with wish to offer you discounts, announce new products, and make recommendations that we think you'll like.

AdRoll believes in giving you the power to stay in control of the ads you see. Therefore, we give you the ability to opt out of relevant advertising from us. If you do, we may still serve ads to you, they just won't be tailored to your interests. 

Our commitment to protecting your privacy is outlined in the policy below. This privacy policy describes the overall company Privacy Policy of Semantic Sugar Inc. (referred to as "AdRoll", "AdRoll.com", "we", "us", "our") and the services offered on the AdRoll.com website (referred to as "Services", "Service").

## Our privacy policy explains:

  * What information we collect
  * How we use that information
  * What information we share with our partners
  * The choices we offer



AdRoll's Privacy Policy is broken out into two sections. Section I explains AdRoll’s privacy policies regarding the collection, use, and sharing of data from visitors to our website and the online advertising AdRoll displays across various websites. Section II covers AdRoll’s privacy policies with regard to customer accounts. 

## The benefits of interest based advertising:

  * **Save Money:** Relevant ads can offer you deals and discounts that will interest you and save you money.
  * **Free Your Inbox:** Brands can market to you without clogging your email inbox with messages.
  * **Keep Content Free:** Free online content is made possible by effective online advertising, like retargeting.



## What information does AdRoll collect and how do we use that information?

AdRoll collects non-personally identifiable information about your activities when you visit our website, the website of entities for which we serve advertisements (our "Advertisers"), or the websites and online services where we display advertisements ("Publishers"). This information may include the content you view, the date and time that you viewed this content, the products you purchased, or your location information associated with your IP address. We use the information we collect to serve you more relevant advertisements (referred to as "Retargeting"). We collect information about where you saw the ads we serve you and what ads you clicked on. 

We do not target ads to you based on sensitive health data, though we do work with health and fitness companies and may show you more relevant ads based on your perceived interest in these topics.

We may target ads based on data provided by Advertisers or partners in combination with the data we collect ourselves. The data provided by third parties may originate both online and offline, though any data used to serve targeted advertisements is de-identified and is not used to personally identify you.

## Third Parties on our Website and Our Advertiser's Websites

In order to allow AdRoll and our Advertisers to reach the best inventory online, we work with third party advertising companies (our "Advertising Partners") to help us recognize you and serve relevant advertisements to you when you visit a website or online service in their network. We also work with Advertising Partners who help us recognize you across different devices in order to show you relevant advertisements. Our Advertising Partners may collect information about your activities on our website, our Advertisers' websites, and other websites or online services in their networks. We work with third party companies to assist us with website analytics such as monitoring and evaluating the use and operation of our website so that we can continue to enhance the website and our services.

## Technologies We and Our Third Party Advertising Partners Use

AdRoll uses technologies such as cookies and pixels to keep track of your activities on our website and our Advertiser's websites, and to serve you more relevant advertisements. A cookie is a small text file that is stored on your device for record-keeping purposes. Session cookies expire when you close your browser. Persistent cookies remain on your device for an extended period of time. We and our third party partners use session cookies and persistent cookies to make it easier for you to navigate and enhance the experience of our site, and to monitor and evaluate our website's operation and use. 

We use persistent cookies to keep track of your activities when you visit our website or our Advertisers' websites, and to serve you relevant advertisements. Our Advertising Partners also place persistent cookies on your device when you visit our website or our Advertisers' websites in order to help us recognize you and serve relevant advertisements to you when you visit their website or online service or websites in their networks. Here's how it works: When you visit our website or one of our Advertiser's websites, an AdRoll pixel on that site causes an AdRoll cookie and our Advertising Partners' cookies to be set in your browser. When you visit one of our Advertising Partner's websites or a website in one of their networks, the Advertising Partner will recognize your browser. AdRoll or the Advertising Partner may then serve an ad of the Advertiser on whose site AdRoll originally set the cookie. AdRoll or the Advertising Partner then may track how many times it shows you an ad from that Advertiser and whether or you clicked on the ad. AdRoll's policy is that our Advertising Partners only collect non-personally identifiable information via these cookies and we will cease working with partners found violating this policy.

You can remove cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser's "help" file. You may also decline our cookies if your browser permits, but doing so may interfere with your use of our website.

## Your choices regarding relevant advertisements

We believe in giving you control over which ads you see. You may opt out of receiving all Retargeted ads from AdRoll (whether served by us or on our behalf). If you delete your cookies you will need to opt out again. Further, if you use multiple browsers or devices, you will need to execute this opt out on each browser or device.

## What is that icon on the ads we serve?

AdRoll uses the Evidon assurance platform to comply with the cross-industry Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising as managed by the [Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA)](http://www.aboutads.info/). As part of this service, AdRoll's online advertisements and website are sometimes delivered with icons that help consumers understand how their data is being used and provide consumers choice regarding the ads that they receive.
