# Privacy | AdRoll

Want to see spammy ads for mortgages, life Insurance, and long lost classmates?

Neither do we. That's why we're working with businesses to present ads that are useful for you. The companies that AdRoll works with will use this ad space to offer you discounts, announce new products, and make recommendations that we think you'll like based on totally anonymous info. All we recognize about you is your browser, and we do not collect or store any personal information about you.

AdRoll believes in giving you the power to stay in control of the ads you see. Therefore, we give you the ability to opt out of relevant advertising. If you do, you will still see ads, they just won't be customized based on what we think you'll actually like.

AdRoll's Privacy Policy is broken out into two sections. Section I is related to the data AdRoll captures working with advertisers to run display advertising across the internet. Section II covers the data AdRoll captures when customers create an account with AdRoll.

## The benefits of interest based advertising:

  * **Save Money:** Relevant ads can offer you deals and discounts that will interest you & save you money.
  * **Free Your Inbox:** Brands can market to you without clogging your email inbox with messages.
  * **Keep Content Free:** Free web content is made possible by effective advertising, like retargeting.



We believe in giving you control over which ads you see. Click here to learn about our opt out policy, or view our complete privacy policy below.

The following describes the overall company Privacy Policy of Semantic Sugar Inc. (referred to as "AdRoll", "AdRoll.com", "we", "us", "our") and the services provided on the AdRoll.com website (referred to as "Services", "Service"). We understand how important it is to keep your personal information confidential, especially online. Our commitment to protecting your privacy is outlined in the policies below. This policy was designed to inform you of the information we collect when you visit AdRoll.com as well as our customer's (referred to as "Advertisers" websites or "Publishers" websites) and then how the information is collected and used by companies that display advertisements (referred to as "Partners"). Those who visit our Advertisers' or Publishers' websites are referred to as "Prospects" throughout this policy. Because our policy may be updated periodically we encourage you to review these pages on a regular basis.

## What does AdRoll know about me through the ads they serve?

We do not know who you are. We do not know your name, your email address or any other personally identifiable information about you. We do not collect any personally identifiable information from the publisher website on which you may have seen our ads. We do know that the Internet Browser you are using has visited one of our partner sites (probably an online retailer) in the last 90 days. The data that we capture from your browsing behavior is retained by AdRoll for up to 18 months and then annonymized. 

## What information does AdRoll collect about me through their technology and how do they use that information?

We only collect anonymous data. In order to identify which products you might be interested in, AdRoll records, via anonymous cookies, which pages you have browsed on our partners' website. Cookies keep the information of which pages you viewed, and in certain cases which products you bought. This data is anonymous and there is absolutely no way for AdRoll to identify the visitor. We do not take any user information from a retailer that they may have stored about you (name, address, etc). We do not share any data with any site that displays our advertising. 

We tailor advertisements based on your activity on our advertisers' websites.  We do not create segments based on sensitive health data in order to serve you more relevant ads though we may show more relevant ads based on your perceived interest in items such as exercise equipment or skin care beauty products. AdRoll's services do also include the ability to run advertising based on cookie data purchased from 3rd party vendors by AdRoll on behalf of AdRoll customers, information that helps us offer you more relevant advertising. 

## Opt Out / Opt In

In order to allow AdRoll advertisers to reach the best inventory online, AdRoll buys across multiple networks. In order to opt out of all retargeted ads, you must opt out of each of the major networks individually. Because this opt-out is cookie-based, if you delete your cookies or use a different browser and revisit an advertiser using AdRoll you will need to opt out again. Click on each link to Opt OUT of all AdRoll retargeted ads.

## What is that icon on the ads being served?

AdRoll uses the Evidon assurance platform to comply with the cross-industry Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising as managed by the [Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA)](http://aboutads.info/). As part of this service, AdRoll's online advertisements and Web sites are sometimes delivered with icons that help consumers understand how their data is being used and provide choice options to consumers that want more control. 

AdRoll is an approved member of the NAI. If you prefer, you may use the [NAI opt out tool](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/).

## Personal and Non-Personal Information

Personally Identifiable Information ("PII") is data about you that is personally identifiable; like your name, email address or credit card number. No PII is collected from the publisher website on which you may have seen our ads. 

Non-Personally Identifiable Information ("NPII") data is collected by AdRoll and AdRoll Partners, and is used by AdRoll for the purpose of improving the quality and relevancy of the advertisements served by AdRoll and AdRoll's Partners (referred to as "Retargeting"). NPII data collected by AdRoll for Retargeting is completely anonymous, and only includes information such as the date and time of visit, domain type, and their activity on our Advertiser's or Partner's websites. None of this information, individually or grouped together, can be traced back to a specific individual.

## How we protect and store both personal and non personal information.

We may share your personal information with:

  * Service providers under contract who help with parts of our business operations; (fraud prevention, bill collection, marketing, technology services). Our contracts dictate that these service providers only use your information in connection with the services they perform for us and not for their own benefit.
  * We may share aggregated non-personally identifiable information about you with Publishers or Advertisers, such as the number of users who visit a Publisher site or the number of users who clicked on a particular advertisement. This information does not identify you individually. Further, we encourage you to review the privacy policies of the Publishers that you visit. You should contact Publishers directly and review their privacy policies should you have questions concerning their use of your information such as, for example, communications you may or may not wish to receive.
  * Companies that we plan to merge with or be acquired by. (Should such a combination occur, we will require that the new combined entity follow this privacy policy with respect to your personal information. If your personal information could be used contrary to this policy, you will receive prior notice.)
  * Other third parties with your consent or direction to do so.



AdRoll.com complies with all statutory and legal requirements with respect to access to information.

## What are cookies?

A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user's computer for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies on this site. We do not link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our site. We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. We use session cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our site. A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser's "help" file.

Persistent cookies enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our site.

## How we use cookies

"Cookies" are small data files that may be downloaded to the browser on your computer when you visit the AdRoll site or an Advertiser or Publisher site and permit the AdRoll server or an AdRoll Partner's server to identify your browser whenever you interact with the AdRoll.com site or with an AdRoll Advertiser or Publisher site.

AdRoll also uses it's cookies to serve relevant and targeted advertisements through Retargeting. A Prospect receives a cookie from AdRoll and AdRoll's Partners when they visit AdRoll.com, and/or when they visit one of AdRoll's Advertiser's websites. When a Prospect visits one of AdRoll's Advertiser websites, an AdRoll pixel on that site sets an AdRoll cookie and AdRoll Partner cookies in the browser being used by the Prospect. When that Prospect visits one of AdRoll's Publisher sites or a site where one of our Partners serves advertisements, the cookie stored in the browser of the Prospect will be recognized by AdRoll's server or the Partner's server. The Prospect will then be shown an advertisement from the Advertiser of the site they visited when the cookie was stored. After this point, AdRoll will track how many times the Prospect is shown an ad from that Advertiser and whether or not they clicked on the ad. This information is part of what AdRoll uses in its reporting, but in no way can be used to identify who that Prospect is, or any other online activities of the Prospect outside of AdRoll's Advertiser, Publisher and Partner websites. AdRoll has no access to Partner cookies but requires that each Partner only collect NPII information for the use of serving ads. Any Partner found in violation of this policy will immediately be removed.

The NPII data collected by AdRoll in the above outlined process of Retargeting will be kept by AdRoll for the period of 18 months after which time all cookie data is annonymized. This information is used strictly for reporting purposes and is not tied to personal information.

We encode our cookies so that only we can interpret the information stored in them. You are free to decline our cookies if your browser permits, but doing so may interfere with your use of our website.

## Data Retention

We retain the anonymous data that we collect (e.g., which pages you have browsed on our partners' website) for up to 18 months from the date of collection.

## Account information we collect

If you open an account, we collect the following types of information from you:

  * Contact information - your name, address, email, and other similar information.
  * Financial information - credit card numbers or PayPal that you link to your AdRoll.com account.
  * We may also use aggregate clickstream information we collect from our website users. This information does not personally identify you and is used primarily to monitor traffic to the website, so we can continue to enhance the website and our services.



Finally, we may collect additional information from or about you in other ways not specifically described here. For example, we may collect information related to your contact with our customer support team or store results when you respond to a survey.

## Personal and Non-Personal Information

Personally Identifiable Information ("PII") is data about you that is personally identifiable; like your name, email address, credit card number or any other information that is not otherwise publicly available. The PII that AdRoll collects from you is information you supply to us; such as your name, email address, credit card number and AdRoll.com account login. The only PII collected by AdRoll is from AdRoll customers who explicitly register for an account at AdRoll.com. That information is maintained by AdRoll so that you do not have to enter it each time you visit our website. No PII is collected from the publisher website on which you may have seen our ads. 

Finally, we may collect additional information from or about you in other ways not specifically described here. For example, we may collect information related to your contact with our customer support team or store results when you respond to a survey. 

We do not share any PII with any third parties nor do we use any personal information for any purposes beyond those stated here.

## How we use cookies

AdRoll uses cookies to recognize repeat visits by users of its Service and to collect information about how users interact with the Service. These cookies contain identification information that enables us to streamline the user experiences using the Services and to report such information to Publishers, Advertisers, and Network Operators.

The NPII data collected by AdRoll in the above outlined process of Retargeting will be kept by AdRoll for the period of 18 months after which time all cookie data is annonymized. This information is used strictly for reporting purposes and is not tied to personal information.

## How we protect and store personal information

Throughout this policy, we use the term "personal information" to describe information that can be associated with a specific person and can be used to identify that person. We do not consider personal information to include information that has been made anonymous so that it does not identify a specific user.

We store and process your personal information on our computers in the US, and we protect it by maintaining physical, electronic and procedural safeguards in compliance with applicable US federal and state regulations. We use computer safeguards such as firewalls and data encryption, we enforce physical access controls to our buildings and files, and we authorize access to personal information only for those employees who require it to fulfill their job responsibilities.

All credit card information is encrypted with 128-bit SSL encryption before it is transmitted across the network.

## How we share personal information with other parties

We may share your personal information with:

  * Service providers under contract who help with parts of our business operations; (fraud prevention, bill collection, marketing, technology services). Our contracts dictate that these service providers only use your information in connection with the services they perform for us and not for their own benefit.
  * Credit bureaus to report outstanding negative balance accounts, as allowed by law.
  * We may share non-personally identifiable information about you with Publishers or Advertisers, such as the number of users who visit a Publisher site or the number of users who clicked on a particular advertisement. This information does not identify you individually and is completely annonymized. Further, we encourage you to review the privacy policies of the Publishers that you visit. You should contact Publishers directly and review their privacy policies should you have questions concerning their use of your information such as, for example, communications you may or may not wish to receive.
  * Companies that we plan to merge with or be acquired by.
