# Privacy | AdRoll

Want to see spammy ads for mortgages, life Insurance, and long lost classmates?

Neither do we. That’s why we’re working with businesses to present ads that are useful for you. The companies that AdRoll works with wish to offer you discounts, announce new products, and make recommendations that we think you’ll like.

AdRoll believes in giving you the power to stay in control of how we use your information. Therefore, we give you the ability to choose whether to have your data collected from this device for the purpose of receiving Retargeted ads from AdRoll.

Our commitment to protecting your privacy is outlined in the policy below. This privacy policy describes the overall company Privacy Policy of Semantic Sugar Inc. (referred to as "AdRoll", "AdRoll.com", "we", "us", "our") and the services offered on the AdRoll.com website (referred to as "Services", "Service").

### Our privacy policy explains:

  * What information we collect
  * How we use that information
  * What information we share with our partners
  * The choices we offer



AdRoll’s Privacy Policy is broken out into two sections. Section I explains AdRoll’s privacy policies regarding the collection, use, and sharing of data from visitors to our website and the online advertising AdRoll displays across various websites. Section II covers AdRoll’s privacy policies with regard to customer accounts.

## Section I – AdRoll Advertising Services

### The benefits of interest based advertising:

  * Save Money: Relevant ads can offer you deals and discounts that will interest you and save you money.
  * Free Your Inbox: Brands can market to you without clogging your email inbox with messages.
  * Keep Content Free: Free online content is made possible by effective online advertising, like retargeting.



### What information does AdRoll collect and how do we use that information?

#### _Information We Collect and How We Use It_

AdRoll collects data about your activities that does not personally or directly identify you when you visit our website, the website of entities for which we serve advertisements (our “Advertisers”), or the websites and online services where we display advertisements (“Publishers”). This information may include the content you view, the date and time that you view this content, the products you purchase, or your location information associated with your IP address. We use the information we collect to serve you more relevant advertisements (referred to as “Retargeting”). We collect information about where you saw the ads we serve you and what ads you clicked on.

We do not target ads to you based on sensitive health data, though, where permitted by law, we do work with health and fitness companies and may show you more relevant ads based on your perceived interest in these topics.

AdRoll may target ads based on data provided by Advertisers or partners alone or in combination with the data we collect ourselves. Any data used to serve targeted advertisements is de-identified and is not used to personally or directly identify you. We require third parties, including Publishers, to provide notice and obtain appropriate consent, where required by applicable law.

#### _Third Parties on our Website and Our Advertiser’ Websites_

In order to allow AdRoll and our Advertisers to reach the best inventory online, we work with third party advertising companies (our “Advertising Partners”) to help us recognize you and serve relevant advertisements to you when you visit a website or online service in their network. We also work with Advertising Partners who help us recognize you across different devices in order to show you relevant advertisements. Our Advertising Partners may collect information about your activities on our website, our Advertisers’ websites, and other websites or online services in their networks. We also work with third party companies to assist us with website analytics such as evaluating the use and operation of our website so that we can continue to enhance the website and our services.
