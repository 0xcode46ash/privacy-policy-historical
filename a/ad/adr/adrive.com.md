### Privacy Policy

(Updated: January 5, 2015)

Your privacy is important to ADrive. This Privacy Policy discloses ADrive's information sharing practices and is incorporated into and is subject to the ADrive Terms of Service (the "Agreement"). You may access the Agreement at [www.adrive.com/terms](http://www.adrive.com/terms). Capitalized words within the Privacy Policy not defined herein have the meaning given to them in the Agreement. By using ADrive Services, You expressly consent to ADrive's use and disclosure of your personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

### A. Information Collection and Use

ADrive is the sole owner of the information collected from its users. Except as required by law, subpoena, or court order, ADrive will not sell, share, or rent this information to others except as permitted by this Privacy Policy.

### B. Registration.

In order to use the ADrive Services, Users must first complete a registration form containing information used to identify the specific User. This information is also used to enforce ADrive's Policy Against Copyright Infringement and its Terms of Service. The User may provide optional identifying information, demographic information, and unique identifiers to enable us to provide a more personalized experience on the Site.

### C. Cookies and Other Technologies.

ADrive uses technologies like cookies and pixel tags to provide, improve, protect and promote ADrive Services. For example, cookies help us with things like remembering your username for your next visit, understanding how you are interacting with ADrive Services, and improving them based on that information. You can set your browser to not accept cookies, but this may limit your ability to use the ADrive Services.

Some of ADrive's business partners use cookies and other technologies for purposes such as serving ads and measuring advertising effectiveness. ADrive, however, has no access to or control over their use of these cookies and is not responsible for the data collected through these cookies, or how any such collected data is used or shared by ADrive's business partners. Any information that third parties collect via cookies and other technologies is completely anonymous.

### D. Log Files.

ADrive uses IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the ADrive Services, and track usage. Users' IP addresses are linked to personally identifiable information for security and operational purposes only.

### E. Correspondence.

ADrive may retain correspondence from Users. Except as required by law or to assist in enforcing the ADrive Terms of Service, such correspondence will be used for tracking purposes only. ADrive will not use it for any secondary purpose or to send You unsolicited electronic mail. Personal Basic Accounts and Free Trial Users will receive advertising and other electronic mail from ADrive affiliates and partners.

### F. Use of Personal Information.

Except as set forth in Your preferences, ADrive will not give, sell, rent, share, or trade any personal information about You to third parties or provide Your personal information, including your name or electronic mail address, to third parties except as required by law, subpoena or court order, and/or as ADrive believes necessary or appropriate in connection with an investigation for fraud, intellectual property infringement, piracy, or other potentially illegal activity and/or for dispute resolution and enforcement of the ADrive Terms of Service. ADrive may share aggregated demographic information with its partners and advertisers. This is not linked to any personal information that can identify any individual person.

### G. Metadata.

By Your use of the ADrive Services, You grant a non-exclusive, sub-licensable license to ADrive for any and all rights in the identifications, descriptions, or other metadata you have provided in connection with your Storage Data. ADrive reserves the right to rent, sell or otherwise share this metadata with other entities at its discretion.

### H. Special Offers.

ADrive may occasionally send information on products, services, special deals, or a newsletter to its Users. Premium and Business Account Users may opt out of receiving these types of communications. Please see ADrive's Choice/Opt-Out provision below.

### I. Security.

ADrive uses available best practices to protect our Users' information. When ADrive asks Users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number), that information is protected with SSL encryption software for transmission to ADrive. All of our Users' information is restricted in our offices. Only employees or contractors who need the information to perform a specific job are granted access to personally identifiable information.

### J. Site and Service Updates.

From time to time, it may be necessary for ADrive to send Users important update announcements via electronic mail.

### K. Choice/Opt-out.

Premium and Business Account Users may opt-out of having their information used for purposes not directly related to the ADrive Services. Premium or Business Account Users who no longer wish to receive promotional materials from our partners may opt-out of receiving these communications via the settings page.

### L. Unlawful Activity by Third Parties.

Though ADrive utilizes industry-standard encryption technology to protect User content from unauthorized access, ADrive cannot warrant and does not guarantee against unlawful interception or access to transmissions or private communications by a third party.

### M. Advertising.

If You are a Personal Basic Account User, we use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when You visit our website. Depending on Your preferences, these companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address, or telephone number) about Your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to You. If You would like more information about this practice and to learn about Your right to opt-out of having this information used by third parties, click here.

### N. Updates to Privacy Policy.

We may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time, and will post the most current version on our website. If a revision meaningfully reduces Your rights, we will notify You.

If we are involved in a reorganization, merger, acquisition or sale of our assets, Your information may be transferred as part of that deal. We will notify You (for example, via a message to the email address associated with Your account) of any such deal and outline Your choices in that event.
