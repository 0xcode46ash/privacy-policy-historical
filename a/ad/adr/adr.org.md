# AAA - Arbitration, Mediation and other forms of Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) - Privacy Policy

|  | 

This Privacy Policy ("Policy") sets forth the American Arbitration Association’s ("AAA") policies regarding the collection and use of information via this Portal located at adr.org and disputeriskmanagement.org (including all pages under such second level domain names, collectively, the "Portal") and the Portal’s Internet-based alternative dispute resolution facility ("Online ADR System"). The Portal is generally accessible by all visitors to the Portal ("Visitors"); the Online ADR System is only accessible by parties who have registered as users of the Online ADR System ("Parties").

INFORMATION COLLECTION AND USE 

General

Visitors and Parties understand and agree that AAA may collect, maintain, and process information provided by them to AAA, and information collected by AAA concerning such Visitors and Parties, on and through the Portal and the Online ADR System. 

Public Areas of the Portal

Visitors and Parties may visit the public areas of the Portal without disclosing any personal information about themselves. However, Visitors will have the opportunity to request to receive information from AAA, in which case an e-mail or other address or contact information may be required in order to allow AAA to comply with the request, and for other purposes as may be disclosed at the time the request is made ("Special Purpose Collection"). Visitors may elect to opt-out from receiving communications other than those relating to the Special Purpose Collection by (a) following the instructions in OPT-OUT CHOICES, below, (b) checking appropriate opt-in or opt-out boxes which may be provided on the collection form or (c) as set forth in the communication sent from AAA.

Online ADR System Registration Information

In order to participate in the Online ADR System, AAA requires Parties to register with the Online ADR System by, among other things, providing contact information such as (for illustration purposes only) user ID, password, name, title, department, business address, business telephone number, business e-mail address and other contact information ("Registration Information"). Certain portions of the Registration Information concerning the Party will be used for evaluating qualifications for participation in the Online ADR System. AAA may also use Registration Information to communicate with Parties regarding proceedings, changes in Online ADR System functionality, features, billing, help desk and other activities relating to the operation of the Online ADR System. AAA may disclose the Registration Information of a Party to administrators, arbitrators and/or other Parties who are designated by such Party (through such Party’s use of the Online ADR System or otherwise) to be provided access to such information. At Your option, some portions of Your Registration Information may be made available to other users of the Portal in online directories, search features and/or Peer Groups. AAA may also use Registration Information to send Parties information about products or services available on or through the Online ADR System and offers made available by AAA's partners, which may be sent by AAA or the AAA partner making the offer. Instructions on how to request that AAA not send future communications (except for communications necessary for the operation of the Online ADR System) or that AAA not share Registration Information with third parties, are set forth in OPT-OUT CHOICES, below and, for AAA transmitted material which is unrelated to the operation of the Online ADR System, in each communication. 

Case Management Information and Materials

Privacy terms relating to confidential information and materials a Party submits to the Online ADR System (not including the rest of the Portal or any public areas of the Portal) in the course of such Party's ADR proceeding may be set forth in the AAA Rules and/or any other agreement between the Parties.

Usage Data

AAA will record and collect information about how Visitors and Parties use the Portal, including the Online ADR System. This data may include a Visitor's or Party's domain name, language, type of browser and operating system, Internet Service Provider, Internet protocol (IP) address, the Web site from which they arrived at the Portal, the amount of time spent on the Portal or using the Online ADR System and the ways in which they use the Portal or the Online ADR System (collectively, "Usage Data"). AAA will monitor and use Usage Data in aggregated form to measure the Portal's performance and Online ADR System activity and improve the Portal's design and functionality. AAA may also use Usage Data in aggregated form to develop and distribute to third parties statistical and other information about how the Portal and Online ADR System are used and for other marketing purposes. AAA may also disclose aggregate Usage Data to other Visitors and Parties. AAA may also use Usage Data in unaggregated form to investigate and prosecute security violations or to identify the particular Visitor or Party who engaged in particular transactions. 

Cookies

“Cookies” are pieces of information that are placed on a User’s computer hard drive to enable the individual to more easily communicate and interact with the Portal, including but not limited to the Online ADR System. We use cookies to customize Your experience on the Portal. We also use cookies to record how many times a user has visited our Portal and what pages the user has accessed. You may, however, disallow receiving cookies at any time through Your web browser, although this may affect the usability of the Portal. It is not our intention to use cookies to retrieve information that is unrelated to our Portal or Your interaction with our Portal.

Peer Groups

AAA may make available certain public and/or private forums such as bulletin boards, e-mail lists and chat rooms (collectively, "Peer Groups") on the Portal or the Online ADR System. Any and all information posted on or through a Peer Group will be generally accessible for viewing by others. Accordingly, participants are encouraged to exercise discretion when using Peer Groups.

OPT-OUT CHOICES

To "opt-out" of (1) receiving communications from AAA (except for communications necessary for the operation of the Portal or the Online ADR System, or as otherwise permitted under this Policy), (2) having contact information disclosed to third parties (except as necessary for AAA to operate the Portal and Online ADR System, or as otherwise permitted under this Policy), or (3) any other consent previously granted for a specific purpose concerning Your personal information, send an e-mail to the AAA Data Controller at ecgcustomerservice.org. 

REVIEW/CHANGE CONTACT INFORMATION

Requests to review or change Registration Information previously provided on or through the Portal or the Online ADR System may be made to AAA by sending an e-mail to the AAA Data Controller at ecgcustomerservice.org.

LINKED SITES

AAA may provide links to third parties' Web sites ("Linked Sites") from the Portal or the Online ADR System. Linked Sites are not necessarily reviewed, controlled or examined by AAA in any way and AAA is not responsible for the privacy policies and practices of any such Linked Sites, or any additional links contained therein. These links do not imply AAA's endorsement of or association with the Linked Sites. 

DISCLOSURE PURSUANT TO LAW

AAA may make information concerning Visitors, Parties, the Portal and the Online ADR System, and the uses thereof, available to law enforcement personnel and agencies as required by law or in order to enforce the Terms of Use, and may disclose such information if required by law or a judicial or governmental order or subpoena. Where permitted by law, AAA may also disclose such information to law enforcement personnel and agencies, or use such information as part of legal process, in order to protect its property or in furtherance of an investigation regarding a breach of the Online ADR System's rules and policies or any unauthorized access to or use of the Portal or the Online ADR System, or any illegal activities concerning a particular Visitor or Party. 

CONSENT TO PROCESSING

By using or providing information to the Portal or the Online ADR System, Visitors and Parties understand and unambiguously consent to the collection, processing and use of such information in the United States and other countries and territories, for the purposes of providing the Portal, the Online ADR System and related services and as otherwise set forth in herein or in the AAA Rules. 

SERVICE PROVIDERS

AAA may utilize third parties to provide or perform certain services and functions on the Portal and the Online ADR System. For example, AAA may use a Web site tracking evaluation firm to analyze Visitor and Party's use of the Portal and the Online ADR System, and AAA may use third party suppliers to provide certain functionality and services provided on the Online ADR System. AAA will make information concerning Visitors and Parties and their use of the Portal and Online ADR System available to these service providers and business partners, as necessary, to perform these functions and services. The service providers may be located throughout the world; therefore information relating to Visitors and Parties may be sent worldwide to countries which have a different level of privacy protection to the U.S. or a Visitor's or Party's country of residence. 

TRANSFER OF INFORMATION

In the event of a sale, merger, consolidation, reorganization, liquidation, dissolution, change of control or sale or transfer of the substantial assets of AAA, information collected via or stored on the Portal or the Online ADR System may be sold, assigned or transferred to a party acquiring all or substantially all of the equity and/or assets of AAA related to the Portal. AAA may also transfer such information to its subsidiaries and affiliates involved in the operation of the Portal or the Online ADR System. 

SECURITY

AAA takes seriously the security of Your personal information. AAA has therefore implemented technology and security policies and procedures intended to reduce the risk of accidental destruction or loss, or the unauthorized disclosure or access to, such information, reasonably appropriate to the level of the data concerned. For example, the Portal implements 128 bit SSL technology to protect certain sensitive data that is transmitted via the Portal. However, due to the open communication nature of the Internet, we cannot guarantee that communications between You and the Portal, and the Portal and You, or data stored on AAA's systems, will be free from unauthorized access by third parties.

UPDATES TO THE PRIVACY POLICY

AAA may, in its sole discretion, update this Policy at any time and from time to time, by posting the amended Policy on the Portal. The revised or amended Policy shall be effective upon posting. Any access to or use of the Portal or Online ADR System following such update shall be deemed consent to such update. Visitors and Parties are therefore encouraged to refer back to this page regularly. This Policy may not be otherwise amended without the written consent of AAA. 

CONTACT, QUESTIONS, COMMENTS, COMPLAINTS

If You would like to communicate with AAA regarding privacy issues or have questions, comments or complaints about this Policy, please forward such communication to ecgcustomerservice.org.
