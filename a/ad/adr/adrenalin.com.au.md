Collection of personal information by Adrenaline**

The personal information we collect and store will depend on what products and services you request from us. This includes (but is not limited to) information provided when requesting an adventure booking, gift voucher, gear and/or membership. Our sites registration form requests users’ [which includes third party personal information where applicable collected as described below] to give us contact and profile information such as name, email address, phone number, mailing address, age, medical conditions and dietary requirements.  Some of the requested information is required in order to receive the Adrenaline product or service; other information is optional.  
**  
Where your personal information is stored**   
Where we store your personal information depends on what products and services you have requested from Adrenaline. Data is stored in our CRM for the use of processing transactions, providing order confirmations and dispatching products. Information provided in customer feedback forms is also stored on this system. We also maintain an email database for subscribers to our monthly e-newsletters.  
**  
Ways we use data**   
We collect your personal information so that we can use it for our functions and services. This may include, but is not limited to:

  * processing your orders including bookings, gift vouchers, gear and membership.
  * providing confirmation of your adventure booking and advise of any changes or additional information.
  * sending out feedback and surveys and addressing any issues or complaints.
  * answering any queries about Adrenaline and its products and services.
  * sending targeted advertising and promotions that allow us to provide our service;
  * sending special deals, promotions and offers based on users interests plus other news on Adrenaline including updates of new, or enhanced services.
  * confirming receipt of profile changes.
  * serving ads, promotions and special offers on Facebook. Any personal information provided to Facebook will be "hashed", a process that summarises text into a short fingerprint that cannot be decrypted and does not allow the original information to be recovered later by decryption. At no time will Facebook have access to any original, discernible personal information that it does not already have.



If you do not provide us with your personal information, we will be unable to do one or more of the above. Upon placing an order with Adrenaline, you are automatically subscribed to receive our monthly e-newsletter and associated communications as per section below on ‘inferred consent’.  
 **  
Inferred consent**   
Section 2.3.2 of the Australian e-Marketing Code of Practise states that  _“Message Originators and Message Service Providers may send…Commercial Communications to Recipients…providing that… it can be reasonably Inferred … that the Recipient has Consented to receive such Commercial Communications (Inferred Consent)._ ” According to section 2.4.1 ‘Inferred consent’ is deemed to exist if Adrenaline can show that the Recipient has an existing and continuing relationship with us, and would have a reasonable expectation of receiving such commercial communications. Recipients therefore include all customers, account holders, subscribers, members, licencees, registered users, employees and contractors. For this reason, every person who submits an order for an Adrenaline product, or service will automatically be added to our subscriber database.
