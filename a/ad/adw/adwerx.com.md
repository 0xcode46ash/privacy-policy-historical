Welcome to the AdWerx website, owned, produced and operated by eMinor Inc. This information and this Privacy Policy applies to our website, AdWerx.com (the “Web Site”).

By using AdWerx you agree to be bound by this Privacy Policy, whether or not you register as a registered user through the Web Site (“Registered User”). Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. 

AdWerx cares about online privacy. If you have any questions concerning this Privacy Policy, please email us at [privacy@adwerx.com](mailto:privacy@adwerx.com). 

**INFORMATION COLLECTION AND USE BY ADWERX**  
AdWerx collects Registered User submitted personal information such as name, mailing address, email address, and telephone number to authenticate Registered Users, and to send notifications to those Registered Users relating to, without limitation, the AdWerx service and special offers, and the provide the products and services you requested. 

As is standard practice on many corporate websites, AdWerx also logs non-personally- identifiable information including IP address, profile information, aggregate user data, and browser type, from users of the Web Site. This data is used to improve the website services, to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users’ movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. AdWerx will not use the information collected to market directly to that person. This non-personally-identifiable information may be shared with third-parties to provide more relevant services and advertisements to our users. IP addresses of those who visit the Web Site may also be recorded for security and monitoring purposes. 

In addition AdWerx uses pixel tags - tiny graphic images - to tell us what parts of the Website have been visited or to measure the effectiveness of searches users perform on our site. Pixel tags also enable us to send email messages in a format that our users can read. And they tell us whether emails have been opened to assure that we’re only sending messages that are of interest to our Registered Users. AdWerx stores all of this information in a secure database. 

AdWerx may also use a Registered User’s email address to send updates, a newsletter or news regarding the service. AdWerx may send email messages which use a “click-through URL” linked to content on the Web Site. When a customer clicks one of these URLs, they pass through our web server before arriving at the destination web page. AdWerx tracks this click-through data to help determine interest in particular topics and measure the effectiveness of our customer communications. If you prefer not to be tracked simply avoid clicking text or graphic links in the email. 

AdWerx may also collect information for market research purposes to gain a better understanding of our customers and thus provide more valuable service. AdWerx also collects information regarding customer activities on the Web Site, and on related websites. This helps us to determine how best to provide useful information to customers and to understand which parts of our websites and Internet services are of most interest to them. 

In cases where you use a mobile device to access our sites or use or applications, we may receive information about the location of your device. 

We use the information that we collect to develop, deliver, and improve our products, services, and other offerings.
