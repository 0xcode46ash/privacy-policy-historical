## SDK Privacy Policy

**Last updated August 12, 2014**

This Policy explains how information collected is used by Adonit and Adonit Creative ("Adonit", “we”, “us”, “our”). 

This Policy only applies to information collected by Adonit from applications or apps (“applications”) that integrate our Adonit SDK. Applications may also collect information of their own, to which their own policies, if any, may apply. 

This Policy does not apply to Adonit’s websites or services that display or link to different privacy statements. 

### INFORMATION WE COLLECT

The information Adonit collects with the Adonit SDK includes: stylus serial number, stylus model and version, stylus user settings, application used, iPad model, iOS version, Adonit SDK version, stylus connection and disconnection times, and IP address. 

Although none of this information is directly personally identifying, because the IP address and stylus serial number may potentially be used in a personally identifying manner, Adonit has chosen to implement this Privacy Policy and is taking steps to join the US-EU and US-Swiss Safe Harbor Programs. 

### HOW WE USE INFORMATION WE COLLECT

Adonit collects information from the Adonit SDK primarily to provide improved cross-application multi-device stylus experiences for you. Secondarily, the information Adonit collects may be used by us to help you if you contact us for customer support for your stylus. Adonit may also use the information in aggregate to discover problems with our SDK and applications that use it, and to work to improve the stylus experience for our customers in general. 

For example, we may use your information to:

  * Improve the Adonit SDK and application integration of the Adonit SDK; 
  * Enhance your experience using our stylus products across applications; 
  * Increase our understanding of how users prefer to use our stylus products to help us improve our products 
  * Provide individual customer support to you at your request; and 
  * Respond to your comments or questions.



Adonit may store and process personal information in the United States and other countries. By using the Adonit SDK you consent to this transfer of your personal information. 

### SHARING OF PERSONAL INFORMATION

##### Information You Share

Adonit’s privacy policy does not extend to the applications that integrate the Adonit SDK. To learn about those applications’ privacy policies, please read their policies. 

##### Information We Share

We do not share your personal information with third parties without your consent other than: 

  * To comply with laws or to respond to lawful requests and legal process; or 
  * For the purposes of a business deal (or negotiation of a business deal) involving sale or transfer of all or a part of our business or assets (business deals may include, for example, any merger, financing, acquisition, divestiture or bankruptcy transaction or proceeding). 



We do not share aggregate or de-identified information derived from your personal information. 

##### Personal Information Security

Adonit takes reasonable steps to help protect your personal information in an effort to prevent loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction. 

### CHILDREN

If you are under 18, or the age of majority in the jurisdiction in which you reside, you may only use the Adonit SDK with the consent of your parent or legal guardian. 

YOUR INFORMATION CHOICES AND CHANGES

Contact Adonit customer support to stop data collection.

### CHANGES TO THIS POLICY

Adonit may change this Policy from time to time. If we make any changes to this Policy, we will change the "Last Updated" date above. You agree that your continued use of our Services after such changes have been published to our Services will constitute your acceptance of such revised Policy. 

Contacting Adonit and Dispute Resolution

Adonit provides periodic training for its employees involved in the collection and use of personal information. We periodically self-assess and review the training, our internal policies, and our procedures to review compliance. 

In compliance with the US-EU and US-Swiss Safe Harbor Principles, Adonit commits to resolve complaints about your privacy and our collection or use of your personal information. European Union or Swiss citizens with inquiries or complaints regarding this privacy policy should contact Adonit at: 

  * A. Email: support@adonit.net
