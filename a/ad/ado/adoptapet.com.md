# Privacy Policies :: Adopt-a-Pet.com

**So, what are the rules?**  
Adopt-a-Pet.com is a free service where your local animal shelters and rescue groups lists their pets available for adoption. It is free for you to use and free for the animal shelters and rescue groups as well. We simply provide a way for you to see homeless pets that animal shelters and rescue groups are advertising for adoption. The adoption fees and adoption guidelines for each pet vary with the different shelters so to find out about a particular pet, please contact the organization directly who has the pet. We do not house, make any guarantees or have any contact with any of the pets listed on our website. Information regarding pets posted on Adopt-a-Pet.com is provided by the posting organization and is not checked for accuracy nor guaranteed to be accurate or complete. We are not therefore responsible for any issues that may arise out of contact you have with any pets listed on our site. We are also not responsible for any issues that arise regarding any of the organizations or individuals that post pets on our site. We do our best to make sure that animal shelters and rescue groups keep their listings on our website up to date, and that these groups are reputable and responsive to the public, but we assume no responsibility for any actions any of these organizations may or may not take. By using the Adopt-a-Pet.com website, you releases Adopt-a-Pet.com and it's parent foundation as well as all sponsors from any and all liability arising out of or in any way connected with the use of this website or the adoption of a pet listed on the this website. 

**We hate spam too, grrr... hsss...**  
We will not give your e-mail, or any personal information you give us to evil forces who send out annoying spam! We hope they get barked at, hissed at, and step in poop. By opting in to any e-mail communication of ours, you are also opting into e-mails from our non-profit sponsor North Shore Animal League America (NSALA), and also from our sponsor Nestle Purina PetCare Company, who produces pet care products. Any e-mail you get from us or our sponsors will be one you asked for. You will always have the choice never to hear from any of us again.

**Like a loyal pooch, we protect your privacy...**  
If you make a donation to our non-profit organization, no one but the computers at the processing company will see your credit card number, not even us! Online donations with us are secure.

**What info we sniff out and how we use it...**  
If you make a donation or sign up to volunteer,we'll ask your name, e-mail address, e-mail format preference (HTML vs. text), address, phone, and interests and that's it.

**Use of "Cookies", yum...**  
Oh, not that kind of cookie. Cookies are pieces of information that many websites transfer to a computer browsing that website. We use them for record-keeping purposes and to customize your experience. Your browser is probably set to accept cookies. But, if you would prefer not to receive cookies, you can change the configuration of your browser to refuse cookies. If you choose to have your browser refuse cookies, it is possible that some areas of our site will not function properly when you view them.

**Tell a friend there's something to bark about...**  
If you use our "tell a friend" feature and type in an e-mail, we'll automatically send the friend a one-time e-mail inviting them to visit the site. We store this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time e-mail.

**Leaving our back yard—other web sites...**  
Our site contains links to other web sites (shelters, pet rescue groups, etc.).When you click on one of these links, you are entering another web site for which Adopt-a-Pet.com has no responsibility. It's like going off-leash at the dog park. We encourage you to read the privacy statements on all such sites as their policies may be different than ours.

**Nerdy computer stuff...**  
We collect an IP address from all visitors to our site. An IP address is an anonymous number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you use the Internet. We use IP addresses to diagnose problems with our system, administer our site, analyze trends, track users' movement, gather broad demographic information to improve the site, and deliver customized, personalized content.

**Security...**  
We protect account information by placing it on a secure portion of our site that is only accessible by certain qualified employees. Unfortunately, however, no data transmission over the Internet is 100% secure. While we strive to protect your information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of such information.

**Donor Privacy Policy...  **  
Although Adopt-a-Pet.com is a non-profit charitable organization, we encourage supporters to donate money directly to animal shelters who are caring for animals. However, since our free service is highly valued by the public and by the thousands of animal shelters we serve, occasionally people do wish to donate directly to Adopt-a-Pet.com to support our work and our mission, and we welcome this support.

Adopt-a-Pet.com respects the privacy of our users and supporters, and this Privacy Policy is in place to protect them.

**Collection and Use of Donor Personal Information...**  
Adopt-a-Pet.com collects and at times uses personal information such as name, address, phone number, and e-mail address when voluntarily provided to our organization.

Adopt-a-Pet.com does not sell, trade, or share its donor list with any other organization or entity.

Adopt-a-Pet.com will never share donor information for any use other than processing and acknowledging donations. Adopt-a-Pet.com keeps a record of each donor's giving history. This information is kept on file for IRS purposes and for our own internal reporting.

Adopt-a-Pet.com stores donor information for record keeping purposes and in order to contact past donors via our monthly e-newsletter, "The Scoop". Donors may opt out of receiving email from Adopt-a-Pet.com at any time.

**Donor Information Security...**  
Donor past giving information is kept in a separate password-protected database that is not accessible by the public, nor by Adopt-a-Pet.com staff beyond the staff directly involved with processing of donations. Donor contact information (without any giving history) is included in our password-protected newsletter database, and is accessible only by Adopt-a-Pet.com staff directly involved with delivering the e-newsletter.
