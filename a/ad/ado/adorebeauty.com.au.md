# Adore Beauty - Online Shopping for Beauty Products and Cosmetics

What is Adore Beauty's stance on Privacy?

Adore Beauty respects your online privacy. Your private details will remain just that - private. The following Privacy Statement sets out the different types of information we collect, why we collect it and what you can do if you would like to remove yourself from a mailing list or change any details we may hold. If you need to contact us to discuss any of the below, our contact details can be found [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20071011092625id_/http%3A//www.adorebeauty.com.au/adorebeauty/contactus.asp).

What information does Adore Beauty collect?

There are a couple of different types of information that Adore Beauty may collect to make your shopping and browsing experience more enjoyable.

Firstly, if you sign up as a member, we will collect your name, country of origin, and email address. If you elect to receive our newsletter, your email address will be added to our mailing list. We will only use your e-mail address for that purpose, you will not be put on the mailing lists of any third parties, and neither your email address nor your name or country will not be divulged to anyone else. We will only use these details to post to you about new developments, products, news and events (and we'll do so no more than twice a month). Removing yourself from the mailing list will also be easy; you can read more about this below.

Order information such as your name, billing address, delivery address, email address and phone number are collected in order to effect delivery of the products that you order, and to contact you in regard to your order if necessary. These details are retained in our database so that you don't have to retype them every time you place an order. You can change or delete these details at any time by logging in using your email address and password, and then going to the [Modify Details](https://web.archive.org/web/20071011092625id_/http%3A//www.adorebeauty.com.au/adorebeauty/customerModifyForm.asp) section.

If you elect to pay online using your credit card, your card details are not viewed by us or by any person except you, at any time during the transaction. They are encrypted and passed directly to the Bank through our security provider [Esec](http://www.esec.com.au/). You can read more about our payment systems and security in the [Help](https://web.archive.org/web/20071011092625id_/http%3A//www.adorebeauty.com.au/adorebeauty/helpSecurity.asp) section. We do not retain your credit card details.

Any other information you provide at the checkout, such as comments or survey responses, are used to better plan future items to add and developments for the web site.

General site traffic data is also collected for the purpose of site maintenance and improvement. This provides only generalised information about how often certain pages are viewed. This does not identify individual users, but instead helps us to understand what sorts of products our customers are interested in, and alerts us to any areas of the site that may be difficult to navigate.

How can I un-subscribe from the newsletter?

You can easily un-subscribe from our mailing list at any time by logging in with your email address and password, going to the [Modify Details](https://web.archive.org/web/20071011092625id_/http%3A//www.adorebeauty.com.au/adorebeauty/customerModifyForm.asp) section and unchecking the "I would like to receive the **adorable** newsletter" box.

What about if the information you have is wrong or needs to be changed?

Again, just login using your email address and password, and go to the [Modify Details](https://web.archive.org/web/20071011092625id_/http%3A//www.adorebeauty.com.au/adorebeauty/customerModifyForm.asp) section. If you are having trouble using this feature, or you need to change your email address, please contact us and we will make the relevant changes and report back to you. If you have any other concerns you should also [contact us](https://web.archive.org/web/20071011092625id_/http%3A//www.adorebeauty.com.au/adorebeauty/contactus.asp).

What about links to other sites?

The Adore Beauty site will from time to time contain hyperlinks to other sites both in Australia and abroad. Adore Beauty cannot be responsible for the data protection and privacy practices of these sites. We urge users to take time to examine individual privacy policies and guidelines on other sites.

What are Cookies and what are they used for?

Cookies are electronic bits of information that move between a website and your computer. For example, on Adore Beauty the Cookies help our shopping system to register and remember products put in your cart. If you would rather not have cookies accepted on your computer you can usually configure your browser not to accept them you. You will however find that you cannot use some sections of the site (such as the shopping cart and members area).
