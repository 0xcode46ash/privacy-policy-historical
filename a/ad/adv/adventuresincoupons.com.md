**Your privacy is important to me and I will respect the information that you submit to me in order to subscribe to my blog, enter  giveaways, participate in a poll or survey, or post a comment. This blog does not collect information from minors, only from adults ages 18 and above. I will never give or sell your email address to anyone.**

All information collected regarding promotions, contests or giveaways (with the exception of comments made on this blog or the Adventures in Coupons/Six Dollar Family Facebook page) is destroyed at promotions end. However, if you win a prize with a verifiable monetary value, I will keep your information (name, email address and mailing address) for tax purposes. Anyone winning prize(s) valued at over $599.99 USD in one calendar year will be required as well to fill out an IRS-1099 form before their prize is shipped (this is HIGHLY unlikely to ever occur however). Also, I do not put a monetary value on coupon envelopes aside from my cost of the envelope and the stamp used to mail.

Prizes with verifiable monetary value may be, but are not limited to:

Jewelry

Electronics

Gift Cards or codes

Gift boxes

In general, you are responsible for the information you submit when you subscribe to my blog, enter giveaways, participate in a poll or survey, or post a comment. Your comments on posts and profile information can be read by anyone and I discourage you from including your email address or other personally identifying information. I do allow you to post comments as “Anonymous” as a way to help protect your privacy.
