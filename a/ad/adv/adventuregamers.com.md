Adventure Gamers respects your privacy. Here's exactly what information Adventure Gamers gathers, and what is done with it:

  * The email addresses collected from the sign-ups for our newsletter are not sold, or disclosed to a third party. The email addresses collected will only be used to send out the newsletter/e-zine. You will not receive any mailings you did not request. The email addresses are stored on a server hosted by Tera-byte.com. You can remove yourself from our list at any time by enterering your email address and selecting "unsubscribe" at the Adventure Gamers Bulletin page.

  * When a contest/sweepstakes is run on this site you may be asked to supply some personally identifying information like your name and email address. This information will only be used to notify winners of the contest/sweepstakes. Non-identifying information may be analyzed, aggregated and presented to third-parties to provide an overview of the demographics of our visitors. 
  * When a survey appears on Adventure Gamers information is collected, compiled and analyzed on an aggregated basis. Adventure Gamers may share this aggregated data with other parties. 
  * Across Adventure Gamers there are several polls. By voting you are not disclosing any other information other then the answer to the question the poll asks. A vote cannot be traced to a specific individual, so your identity remains anonymous. 
  * Every computer on the internet is identified by a unique number called an IP address. The IP address is logged whenever a post in the Adventure Gamers forums is received by the server. This information is used if it becomes necessary to ban a user. The IP address can only be seen by the administrators and community advisors. The IP address is also logged whenever a vote is registered in one of our polls. This information is necessary to avoid any double votes. 
  * The information collected during the registration process for the Adventure Gamers forums is used to contact members in the event of a Forum rule violation. It can also be used to prevent banned users from re-registering under a different username. 



All personal information collected by Adventure Gamers is securely stored on our servers.
