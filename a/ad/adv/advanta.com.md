Our Approach to Small Business Privacy Practices

At Advanta, we recognize that our small business customers are concerned about privacy. We want you to be confident that we make every effort to safeguard the security and confidentiality of your nonpublic personal information. In order for us to maintain high levels of service, personally identifiable information that you provide to us may be shared with our affiliated banks and companies in accordance with applicable law. In some cases we may also bring offers to your attention in cooperation with reputable outside parties. 

We make a concerted effort to restrict access to nonpublic personal information about you to those employees who need to know that information to provide products or services to you, and to maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards that comply with federal standards to guard your nonpublic personal information.
