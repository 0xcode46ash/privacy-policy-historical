Our Approach to Small Business Privacy Practices   
At Advanta, we recognize that our small business customers are concerned about privacy. We want you to be confident that we make every effort to safeguard the security and confidentiality of your nonpublic personal information. In order for us to maintain high levels of service, personally identifiable information that you provide to us may be shared with our affiliated companies in accordance with applicable law. In some cases we may also bring offers to your attention in cooperation with reputable third parties. 

We make a concerted effort to restrict access to nonpublic personal information about you to those employees who need to know that information to provide products or services to you, and to maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards that comply with federal standards to guard your nonpublic personal information.

Opting Out of E-mail Offers   
Advanta sends account-related and third-party e-mail offers to keep its customers informed of special opportunities, online account enhancements and offers that they may want to take advantage of. These offers always come directly from Advanta, and we never share your e-mail address with third-party vendors. And while the majority of our customers appreciate receiving these communications, you always have the option to decline receipt of e-mail. Advanta's e-mail offers include the option to opt out of receiving future e-mail communications. You can choose to decline receipt of any type of e-mail solicitation at any time simply by clicking on the Opt Out link at the bottom of any e-mail and informing us of your preference. In addition, you can set your e-mail preferences online in the [Your Profile](https://web.archive.org/web/20030618221053id_/http%3A//advanta.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=login&destination=profile&session_id=&session_key=) section of Advanta.com. 

You also have the option to decline receipt of direct mail and telemarketing offers from Advanta. Please call our Customer Service Department at 1-800-705-7255 to inform us of your opt out choices. 

Since you are an Advanta customer, we reserve the right to communicate with you via e-mail, direct mail or telephone to protect your account from unauthorized access or identity theft; to process your requests for such things as balance transfers, employee cards or credit line increases; if any collection efforts are indicated; and generally to service your account.
