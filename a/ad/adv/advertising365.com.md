**Privacy Policy**

**What This Privacy Policy Covers**

  * This policy covers how Network22 treats personal information that Network22 collects and receives, including information related to your past use of Network22 products and services. Personal information is information about you that is personally identifiable like your name, address, email address, or phone number, and that is not otherwise publicly available. 
  * This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that Network22 does not own or control, or to people that Network22 does not employ or manage. 

**Information Collection and Use**

      **General**  


  * Network22 collects personal information when you register with Network22, when you use Network22 products or services, when you visit Network22 pages or the pages of certain Network22 partners. Network22 may combine information about you that we have with information we obtain from business partners or other companies. 
  * When you register we ask for information such as your name, email address, birth date, gender, zip code, occupation, industry, and personal interests. For some financial products and services we may also ask for your address, Social Security number, and information about your assets. Once you register with Network22 and sign in to our services, you are not anonymous to us. 
  * Network22 collects information about your transactions with us and with some of our business partners, including information about your use of financial products and services that we offer. 
  * Network22 automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser, including your IP address, cookie information, and the page you request. 
  * Network22 uses information for the following general purposes: to customize the advertising and content you see, fulfill your requests for products and services, improve our services, contact you, conduct research, and provide anonymous reporting for internal and external clients. 

     **Information Sharing and Disclosure**  


  * Network22 does not rent, sell, or share personal information about you with other people or nonaffiliated companies except to provide products or services you've requested, when we have your permission, or under the following circumstances: 
    * We provide the information to trusted partners who work on behalf of or with Network22 under confidentiality agreements. These companies may use your personal information to help Network22 communicate with you about offers from Network22 and our marketing partners. However, these companies do not have any independent right to share this information. 
    * We have a parent's permission to share the information if the user is a child under age 13. Parents have the option of allowing Network22 to collect and use their child's information without consenting to Network22 sharing of this information with people and companies who may use this information for their own purposes; 
    * We respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims; 
    * We believe it is necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of Network22's terms of use, or as otherwise required by law.
    * We transfer information about you if Network22 is acquired by or merged with another company. In this event, Network22 will notify you before information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy. 
  * Network22 displays targeted advertisements based on personal information. Advertisers (including ad serving companies) may assume that people who interact with, view, or click on targeted ads meet the targeting criteria - for example, women ages 18-24 from a particular geographic area. 
    * Network22 does not provide any personal information to the advertiser when you interact with or view a targeted ad. However, by interacting with or viewing an ad you are consenting to the possibility that the advertiser will make the assumption that you meet the targeting criteria used to display the ad.
    * Network22 advertisers include financial service providers (such as banks, insurance agents, stock brokers and mortgage lenders) and non-financial companies (such as stores, airlines, and software companies). 

**Cookies**  


  * Network22 may set and access Network22 cookies on your computer. 
  * Network22 lets other companies that show advertisements on some of our pages set and access their cookies on your computer. Other companies' use of their cookies is subject to their own privacy policies, not this one. Advertisers or other companies do not have access to Network22's cookies. 

**Confidentiality and Security**  


  * We limit access to personal information about you to employees who we believe reasonably need to come into contact with that information to provide products or services to you or in order to do their jobs.
  * We have physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that comply with international regulations to protect personal information about you. 

**Changes to this Privacy Policy**  


  * Network22 may update this policy. We will notify you about significant changes in the way we treat personal information by sending a notice to the primary email address specified in your account or by placing a prominent notice on our site.
