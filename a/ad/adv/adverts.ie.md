  * We will not rent or sell any data which may personally identify you to any third party.
  * We may aggregate your data for disclosure to advertisers or business associates for promotion and marketing purposes.

  * We may access your account for technical processing and to address technical problems or service complaints.
  * We will clearly state why we are collecting personal information and how it will be used.



This website does not use cookies, apart from temporary "session" cookies which enable a visitor's web browser to remember which pages on this website have already been visited. Visitors can use this website with no loss of functionality if cookies are disabled from the web browser. 

Technical details in connection with visits to this website are logged by our internet service provider for our statistical purposes. No information is collected that could be used by us to identify website visitors. The technical details logged are confined to the following items: 

  * The IP address of the visitor's web server the top-level domain name used (for example .i.e., .com, .org, .net).

The technical information will be used only by Adverts.ie, and only for statistical and other administrative purposes. 

You should note that technical details, which we cannot associate with any identifiable individual, do not constitute "personal data" for the purposes of the Data Protection Acts, 1988 & 2003\. 

#### Disclosure Of Information To Third Parties

We may provide Non-Personal Data to third parties, where such information is combined with similar information of other users of our website. 

For example, we might inform third parties regarding the number of unique users who visit the Adverts.ie website, or the activities that visitors to the Adverts website engage in while using the website. 

The third parties to whom we may provide this information may include potential or actual advertisers, providers of advertising services (including website tracking services), commercial partners, sponsors, licensees, researchers and other similar parties. 

We may also share your personal information with: 

  * Law enforcement agencies, other governmental agencies or third parties in response to a request for information (such as a Section 29 (3) Data Protection Act 1998 form) relating to a criminal investigation, alleged illegal activity or any other activity that may expose us, you or any other Adverts.ie user to legal liability. The personal information we disclose may include your Username and ID, Your account history, name, city, county, telephone number, email address, content of Private messages and comments or anything else that we deem relevant. 



#### Your rights regarding data supplied via this website 

You have a right to be given a copy of your personal data which you may have supplied via this website. To exercise this right e-mail us at hello@adverts.ie. 

You should include any personal identifiers which you supplied earlier via the website (e.g. username & e-mail address) if you do not supply this verification information, no information will be provided. 

This request only covers the private information contained in your private profile. Any information that is publically available in posts and threads on the forum will not be provided. Your request will be dealt with as soon as possible and will take not more than 40 days to process. 

#### Nuisance posters

Our first line of defense against nuisance posts is to delete them and to ban the user. Nuisance posts include potentially defamatory material, surreptitious advertising, spam, any other posts which breach the posting guidelines and any form of messages, posts or emails deemed offensive by the administrators or moderators. 

Where a nuisance poster persists, we reserve the right to use email addresses and IP addresses to identify the user and halt the nuisance. For example, on a very few occasions, we have reported to organisations that it appeared that one of their employees or other users of their computer equipment was repeatedly making nuisance posts on Adverts.ie and asked them to take steps to stop it. 

Where a poster recommends the products or services of their employer, they should state their conflict of interest. Where they do not do so, we reserve the right to point out that the poster appears to have a conflict of interest. 

In common with many sites we use Google Analytics for web-site statistics. Some people have raised concerns about the privacy aspects of this service, as Google have access to your IP address (but not your Adverts.ie username or email address). 

In addition to Google analytics Adverts.ie also stores full web logs for analysis purposes. 

#### Security, storage and transfer of information

We follow strict security procedures to ensure that your personal information is not damaged, destroyed, or disclosed to a third party without your permission (unless they are providing services as outlined in the 'who has access to your information' section above) and to prevent unauthorised access to it. The computers that store the information are kept in a secure facility with restricted physical access and we use secure firewalls and other measures to restrict electronic access. If we are working with third parties we will require them to have in place similar measures to protect your information. 

We will explicitly ask you when we need information to identify you. We may require you to co-operate with our security checks before we disclose information to you. You can update the personal information that you give us at any time by viewing your details page. 

We will retain your information for a reasonable period or for as long as is required by law. 

#### Terms of Use

Your use of Adverts.ie is subject to this Privacy Policy as well as our Terms of Use and all of its dispute resolution provisions including arbitration, limitation on damages and choice of law.
