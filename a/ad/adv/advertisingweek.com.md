We will update this Privacy Policy to reflect any changes in our privacy collection and handling practices, and will indicate that changes to this Privacy Policy have been made by listing a new date under “Last Modified” at the end of this Agreement. Such changes will take effect immediately once posted to the Website.

**What type of PD/PII does AW collect from you and how do we use it?**  
AW does not require you to provide us with any PD/PII. Unless you provide your PD/PII to AW through the Website, we will not collect any PD/PII from you. However, in order to use certain functionality (including, for example, to subscribe to our newsletters) on the Website, to participate in promotions offered from time to time or to purchase products through the Website, you will need to provide certain PD/PII to us. PD/PII may include your name, your personal address, the identity of your employer, your business address, your email addresses, your gender, your age, your location, your phone number, your financial information (credit or debit card).

  **Under what circumstances may we share your PD/PII?**  
By clicking “I consent” upon registration, you have agreed that AW may share your PD/PII with other entities who work on our behalf or with us. These entities may use your PD/PII to help fulfill your requests in connection with the Website and to help us communicate with you about different resources offered as part of the Website. Also, our parent, subsidiary and affiliate companies, or entities to which any of our assets, products, sites or operations may be transferred, will be able to use your PD/PII.

For example, our AWConnect™ program allows you to connect with other registered attendees via direct message and LinkedIn. Other means of connection may be added at our sole discretion. We may add a geolocation feature, provided by a third party partner with whom your PD/PII may be shared, to allow you to find your colleagues, making it easy to meet up. Another third party partner may send notifications and messages to you automatically, following your Account preferences.

If we receive your Opt-Out Request after having shared your PD/PII with a third party, AW may not be able to control use of such PD/PII by such third party (or any other party to whom such third party may have transferred your PD/PII). In such an event you agree that AW shall not be responsible or liable, directly or indirectly, for damages or loss caused or alleged to be caused in connection with the use of such PD/PII by any such third party or resulting from any such transfer or disposition. If you are concerned about AW sharing your PD/PII with third parties or otherwise transferring or disposing your PD/PII, you should not provide your PD/PII to AW. We may also release your PD/PII to third parties if we believe such release is necessary (i) to comply with the law (e.g., a legal process or a statutory authorization), (ii) to apply or enforce our user agreements, (iii) to protect our rights or property, (iv) as part of a corporate reorganization, consolidation, merger, or sale of substantially all of the assets of AW, or (v) if we reasonably believe that a danger to any person requires disclosure of such PD/PII.

  **What other information does AW collect?**  
We also may collect anonymous and aggregate information from you about your preferences in navigating the Website by using cookies, action tags and other methods. Cookies are small text files that identify your computer. We may use cookies to, among other things, monitor Website usage, customize Website features, identify your computer’s operating system and browser, and complete transactions. An action tag is a small, graphic image on a webpage that is designed to allow the website owner or a third party to monitor who is visiting a website by collecting the IP address of the computer to which the tag is sent, the URL of the webpage that the tag comes from and the time that such webpage was viewed. Tags may be associated with cookie information. We may also use such non-PD/PII for promotional purposes. If you do not want us to track such information about you, you can set your browser to warn you before accepting cookies and refuse cookies when your browser alerts you to their presence. You can also adjust the settings in your browser to refuse all cookies.

  **How do we store information?**  
While we take commercially reasonable efforts to protect PD/PII provided to us, we cannot guarantee that such information will not be lost, disclosed or accessed by accidental circumstances or by the unauthorized acts of others. If any breaches occur, AW will use its best commercial efforts to notify you of the breach in a timely fashion.

  **Do we transfer information to other nations?**  
We may transfer PD/PII we have collected about you to someone other than you in a foreign country only if such transfer is conducted in accordance with the principles of the nation in which the PD/PII was collected and of the nation to which the PD/PII may be transferred..

  **Does AW provide links to other websites?**  
We may provide links to other websites or resources of possible interest to you. Because we have no control over unaffiliated websites to which we provide links, the collection and use of your PD/PII and other information by such websites shall be subject to the policies and procedures of such websites and not this Privacy Policy.
