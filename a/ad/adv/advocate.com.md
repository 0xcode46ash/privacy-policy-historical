# Privacy statement

**  
  
****Advocate.com Website Privacy Policy**

Advocate.com, part of LPI Media, is committed to protecting the privacy of its users. The following outlines our privacy and data protection policy.

Third-party partners, Advocate.com advertisers, and other Web sites you may access via Advocate.com have different privacy policies and are not subject to this privacy policy. We recommend that you read the privacy statement of each such Web site to find out how your personal information is protected.

**Collection and Use of User Details  
**  
If you opt in to receive Advocate.com’s e-mail newsletter, your e-mail address will be collected. We do not sell or rent e-mail addresses obtained through Advocate.com to any other organization. We do not collect personal identifying information from our visitors--other than what is supplied to us on a voluntary basis. (See "Managing Your Print Subscription.")

When you visit the site, we also collect Web site usage information and information about your computer and Internet connection, including your computer's IP address, the type and version of browser and operating system you use, your Internet domain and, if you arrived at Advocate.com via a link from another Web site, the URL of the linking page.

We use this information to:

  * Personalize the content and advertising you will see based on your personal characteristics or preference.
  * Notify you of relevant new products and features on Advocate.com (if you choose to receive such information)
  * Notify you of promotions from Advocate.com (if you choose to receive such information)
  * Ensure, as far as is practical, that our site is compatible with the browsers and operating systems used by most of our visitors



**We also use the information for in-house research to:**

  * Improve our understanding of customer needs in developing Advocate.com
  * Aid strategic development
  * Manage our relationship with advertisers



The results of all such research and analysis will be presented as anonymous or aggregated information and will not reveal any personal facts about individual customers.

**Managing Your Print Subscription  
**  
We collect your name, postal address, and e-mail address to service and deliver your print magazine subscription. Credit card information is collected only when you choose to make an online payment for your subscription order. Our site is secure for credit card transactions. 

The e-mail address you provide for your print subscription will be used only to contact you about your account with us. We will send confirmation e-mails whenever you place an order, change your address, or otherwise manage your subscription account online. We may also e-mail you when it is time to renew your current subscription or with other special offers directly related to your subscription. Your e-mail address will never be rented or sold to any third party. 

On occasion, your postal address may be used to market to you carefully screened direct-mail offers about products or services from other organizations that we think may be of interest of you. If you prefer not to receive such offers at your postal address, please click here (<http://www.lpimagazines.com/theadvocate/cs.aspx>) to e-mail your request to our customer service department. 

We also collect information you can submit about other people if you order a gift. In such cases, we will use the recipient's name and address to service and deliver his or her print magazine subscription. 

It is important to us that we have your correct contact information so that you don't experience problems with the delivery of products.
