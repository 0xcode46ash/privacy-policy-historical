## **Privacy Policy:**

 **Okan Atmaca (" **Okan Atmaca** ") operates Adjux.com and may operate other websites. It is Okan Atmaca's policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our websites.**

### Website Visitors

Like most website operators, Okan Atmaca collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Okan Atmaca's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Okan Atmaca's visitors use its website. From time to time, Okan Atmaca may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.

Okan Atmaca also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on Adjux.com blogs/sites. Okan Atmaca only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below, except that commenter IP addresses and email addresses are visible and disclosed to the administrators of the blog/site where the comment was left.

### Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information

Certain visitors to Okan Atmaca's websites choose to interact with Okan Atmaca in ways that require Okan Atmaca to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Okan Atmaca gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up at [Adjux.com](http://www.adjux.com/) to provide a username and email address. Those who engage in transactions with Okan Atmaca are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, Okan Atmaca collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor's interaction with Okan Atmaca. Okan Atmaca does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.

### Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information

Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Okan Atmaca's websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Okan Atmaca will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Okan Atmaca discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when Okan Atmaca believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Okan Atmaca, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of an Okan Atmaca website and have supplied your email address, Okan Atmaca may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what's going on with Okan Atmaca and our products. If you send us a request (for example via email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Okan Atmaca takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.
