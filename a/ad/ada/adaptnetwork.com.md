 **1\. Information Collection by us**

Personal Information. We collect personally identifiable information, such as names, mailing addresses, e-mail addresses, demographic information, and similar information in a variety of situations, including but not limited to the following: (i) when you subscribe to one of our newsletters or place an order (see the section below for more information on ordering); (ii) when you register at one of our websites in connection with the purchase of a product, publication, or service; (iii) when you enter personal information on one of our websites as a condition of participating in contests, promotions, or sweepstakes offered via these websites; or (iv) when you wish to have a product or service fulfilled by a fulfilment partner who can meet the continuing needs of our customers.

When you order from us, we collect personally identifiable information from you. If you order one of our products or services, we will collect and maintain your name, e-mail address, billing address, shipping address, telephone number, product selections, credit card or other payment information, order number, referring URL, IP address, page you bought from and a password. We collect this, and other information, as disclosed in this Policy, in order to fill your order, to communicate with you about your order and to send you promotional materials. Before confirming your order, you will have the opportunity to review the product order form and make changes and additions to the information it contained and these changes will be automatically kept for future use.

Information Collected Automatically. Our websites automatically collect certain information, such as your IP address, browser type, domain name, access times and referring website address. This helps facilitate your online experience at our websites. See Sections 4 and 5 of this Privacy Policy for more detail on cookies, web beacons, and other information collected automatically by our websites.

 **2\. How we use your information**

We use the personal information you provide to allow you to make product purchases, to fulfil your requests, improve our Content, products and services, to send you promotional offers related to ADAPT Network or our business partners, and to operate our business. A user may, at any time, opt out of receiving promotional offers by mail or e-mail (see Section 7 for information on controlling your personal information). We also use collected information to evaluate and administer our products and services, respond to any problems that may arise, such as product delivery failures, difficulties in navigating our sites or accessing certain features, as well as to gauge user trends to determine what products and services are most popular with users, and to put you in touch with fulfilment partners who can provide services that we cannot. We allow users of our website to send articles or links by e-mail to other parties who may be interested in them. We do not retain any e-mail addresses of either the sender or recipient of such articles or links after they are sent, and do not share these e-mail addresses with third parties.

We will not disclose your personal information to any other party other than in accordance with this Privacy Policy and as described below:

We may provide personally identifiable information and non-personally-identifiable information to our subsidiaries, affiliated companies, or other businesses or persons for the purpose of processing such information on our behalf. We require that these parties agree to process such information in compliance with our Policy, and we use reasonable efforts to limit their use of such information and to use other appropriate confidentiality and security measures.  
ADAPT’s Service Providers. ADAPT Network may decide to share your personal information with companies that work on behalf of or with ADAPT. These companies may use your personal information to inform you about ADAPT’s products and services, to provide you with information about other exciting products and services, or otherwise to assist ADAPT in serving its customers, understanding its consumer market, or devising effective marketing strategies to reach more consumers.

As in any transaction, your credit card company will have all relevant information about the name of the vendor, item(s) purchased, and date and total cost.

In such cases, we will share your personal information and credit card information with the third party payment services solely for the purpose of completing the transaction or processing your order.

You should be aware that if you voluntarily disclose information, personal or otherwise, online in any community area (whether through ADAPT websites or any other service available online), that information can be collected and used by others.

 **4\. Our use of cookies and other information gathering technologies**

Your Web browser offers “cookies” which, if you allow their use, store small amounts of data on your computer when you visit a website. Cookies do not contain any personally identifiable information about you and therefore cannot be used to identify you personally. Cookies assist us in tracking which of our features you like best, and also enable us to customize our content according to your preferences. You have the ability to accept or decline cookies by modifying your browser and our websites are viewable even if you disable the cookie function on your browser. However, if you disable cookies, some advanced and customized features or offerings on our site will not be available to you.

Additionally, we use third-party companies to collect non-personally identifiable information (e.g., the pages you visit, and which links you click, which ads you see and click on, and the categories of search terms you enter) when you visit one of our websites. Some of these third-party companies collect information when serving ads on our sites, while others collect information without showing ads on our sites. These companies may use the information outlined above (which does not include your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to our sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. These companies often use a cookie or third party web beacon to collect this information.

We may also employ the use of other technologies to track the online usage pattern of our Users in our website but such tracking will not be personally identifiable.

 **5\. Third Party Advertisers**

We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our websites. These companies may use aggregated information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, please see: <http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp>.

We use our own ad server, as a primary ad server, running the Revive Adserver software ([http://www.revive-adserver.com](http://www.revive-adserver.com/)) to serve ad tags to our websites. We may also use DoubleClick as a third party ad server.
