This Site Is Secure For Credit Card Transactions

This site is secure from others stealing your creditcard information. Your credit card and personal information are code-encrypted for security. 

How can you tell if the order is secure? 

It's easy. Check the on-line ordering form before submitting sensitive information. 

If you use a Netscape browser,look at the bottom left-hand corner of the screen for a little key icon (examples: Mac / PC). If the key is solid, not broken, your order information is secure. If it's broken, you are on a page that is not secure and you should not enter sensitive information on that page. 

For Internet Explorer users, a small padlock appears in the lower right-hand corner of the web browser window (examples: Mac / PC). If the padlock is locked, not open, your order information issecure. If it's open, then you are on a page that is not secure, and you shouldn't enter sensitive information on that page. 

There's a couple of other ways for you to check and see if the information you're about to transfer is on a secure connection. Make sure and look for the Paymentech seal (to the right)on our checkout pages. While you can't click on it here, clicking on it before sending your credit card information will show you Paymentech's guarantee that your information will be secure. 

Another option to test the security of your browseris to right-click (Windows), or click and hold (Macintosh), and select Properties (Internet Explorer) or "View Info"(Netscape) to see more information about the page and its security. Click here to see an example from Internet Explorer as to what you should look for to verify that a page is secure. 

Remember this: pages which do not ask you to enter and send information will likely not be secure, so be sure you are on an 'order information' page before checking. It's alwaysa good idea to check for the whole key or closed padlock before you hit the button on the screen that says 'send' or 'submit.' 

Shopping On The Internet: Fact & Fantasy 

Shop with confidence. Your personal information willnot be read by anyone else. 

For many customers, one of the greatest fears about shopping on the Internet is having your credit card number stolen and credit rating ruined with unauthorized purchases. 

This fear is a myth. 

Shopping directly on the Internet is a new way ofdoing business. It's easy to fear the unknown, especially when it comes to your money. 

But how about these situations? 

    1. A crook finds credit card receipt carbons in astore trash can, uses the numbers and then sells them to another crook, who uses the numbers and resells them to another crook who resells them. 
    2. You hand your credit card to a waiter in a restaurant, who then leaves with it to prepare your bill. Or is he calling in his order to another catalog company? 
    3. You dial up your cellular or cordless phone to order shoes from a catalog, and your next door neighbor picks up your information on her baby monitor? 

All of the above (and other scenarios) happen everyday. They illustrate a point. All the talk about 'Internet security' is blown out of proportion. How often do you hear about the anxiety of using your credit card in a restaurant? Or about the danger of allowing a hotel front-desk clerk to confirm your room? 


Why all the fuss about the security risks of shopping on the Internet? 

As far as we know, not a single dollar has been lost to electronic theft of a credit card over the Internet. Compare that with the millions lost every year just in conventional credit card fraud, and you'll wonder what all the fuss is about. 

When you shop on-line with a merchant who offers a Secure Server, all the information you give (name, address,credit card number) is encrypted. That means your information goes out as code. If a hacker could get it, it would likely be gibberish. Your credit card never leaves your hand, it is never picked up by monitors or scanners, and receipts are never found in a trash can.

Wish List Frequently Asked Questions

  * What is a Wish List? 

A Wish List is a convenient place for you to store items that you are interested in but aren't sure you want to purchase yet. 

Or, perhaps you want to share some of the items you've found while browsing adameve.com with some of your friends. Maybe you want to let your significant other know what to get you to get you in the mood! You can also let your friends know what to get you for that totally outrageous bachelor or bachelorrette party to make it a night you'll never forget. 

No matter how you choose to use it, the Wish List is here to help you get everything you want from adameve.com. 

  * How do I add an item to my Wish List? 

To add an item to your Wish List, find the “Add to Wishlist” button on any product page and click it. You will then be prompted to choose the list you'd like to add it to. 

  * How many Wish Lists can I have? 

You can create 1 Wish Lists. You can edit or delete a Wish List at any time. 

  * I keep trying to delete “My Wish List,” but it won't go away! 

You always get to have a Wish List so that you can add items to it at your convenience. We create a new, blank “My Wish List” for you whenever yours is deleted if that's the only Wish List you have. To permanently delete “My Wish List,” simply create a new Wish List not named “My Wish List” and then delete the old “My Wish List.” 

  * How do I share a Wish List with my friends? 

It's simple! You can share a Wish List by visiting the [Share Your Wish List](http://www.adameve.com/wishlist.aspx) page. On that page is a form you can submit that will send an email to the email addresses you specify. In that email will be a link to your Wish List on the adameve.com site and will explain to the person you sent the email to what the link is and why they received the email. 

  * How will they know the email is from me? 

The 'From:' address on the email that we send them will be the email address you registered with so that they will know it's from you. 

  * I've come to a Wish List that says it has been deleted. Why is that? 

Sometimes a user will decide to delete a Wish List after they've sent you an invitation to come view it. In that case, we want you to know so you can contact your friend and find out what happened or you can create your own Wish List and share it with them! 

  * How do I buy something for someone from their Wish List? 

To purchase an item for someone from their Wish List, simply click on the “Add to Cart” button to the right of the item you want to purchase. If you want to send this package directly to the person you're purchasing the item for, make sure to click the checkbox in the middle of the page. Otherwise you will have the option to have the item sent to you or to another address that you specify. 

  * I don't see items I put in my Wish List! Where did they go? 

Sometimes items get removed from our online database or we no longer carry them. So, in order to make things as easy as possible for you, we remove them from the online catalog entirely, including in your Wish List. If it comes back to our catalog, we'll make sure to add it back to your Wish List!

Guide to Safe Sex

  * Why should you practice safe sex? 

Safe sex is about saving your life, or the lifeof your partner. 

Because of AIDS (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome), everyone should know about safer sex. HIV (Human ImmunodeficiencyVirus -- the precursor to the AIDS virus) can infect anyone, regardless of sexual orientation, sex, age, race, or economic class. While the occurrence of AIDS is much higher in some groups than in others, it is not WHO you are that can give you AIDS, but what you DO.

Safe Sex Is:

\- Total abstinence from sex with other people.   
\- A monogamous relationship.   
\- The use of condoms. 

If you say:

'I only intend to sleep with healthy people so I don't need to use condoms.' 

You should know:

You can't tell just by looking at somebody whether they have HIV or any other sexually transmitted disease. It can be unwise to believe everything that a new partner says about their sex life. One doesn't know whether one is infected unless they had an HIV test more than 3 months ago and have not had sex, or have practiced safer sex since. (Don't forget the risks from sharing needles as well.) 

If you say:

'When I've been drinking I can't be bothered using condoms.'

You should know:

Drinking or not, you can still carry condoms with you. Certainly it is more difficult to think logically when you've been drinking. Keep in mind: 'Only have sex using condoms.' 

If you say:

'I hate condoms. I lose my hard-on when I use them.'

You should know:

This is a common fear for many men. How about finding time to practice on your own with condoms, and try different varieties to find one that suits you? Some other good ideas worth trying are putting on the condom with the help of your partner. 

If you say:

'It feels wrong to be using them with my partner. It's too late to start now.'

You should know:

It's never too late to start using condoms, and safe sex is one way to show that you care about each other.
