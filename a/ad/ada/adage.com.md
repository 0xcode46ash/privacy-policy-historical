Information collected about you may be used by us and our affiliates and partnering third-party companies to provide you with the features of Crain’s Products, to enable us to provide the products you requested, to personalize content and advertising, to send you e-mail notifications about our services and products, for audits, to perform statistical analysis of user behavior in order to measure interest in the various areas of our site (such as for product development purposes), to enforce our user agreement and to inform advertisers as to how many users have seen or "clicked" their advertising banners. We will disclose site usage information to third-parties only in aggregate.

_Information from Third Parties._ We may from time to time obtain data about you from third-parties such as business partners, mobile carriers or other companies. If you use your login credentials from a social networking site (“SNS”) to use Crain’s Products, we may receive information from such SNS in accordance with the terms and conditions of the SNS. We may use any data from a third party to include you in our database(s) or append it to existing user data to add more detail to the information we have about you.
