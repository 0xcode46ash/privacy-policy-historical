# Advertising Age - About Us

This is the Web site of Advertising Age. Our postal address is 220 E. 42nd Street, 9th Floor, New York, NY 10019. We can be reached by email at webinfo@adage.com or by telephone at 212-210-0287.

The Ad Age Group, publishers of AdAge.com, has developed this privacy policy to advise site users of our possible uses of information collected during an AdAge.com visit.

For each visitor to AdAge.com, our web server automatically attempts to identify the user's domain name, but not the e-mail address. Occasionally, we may also collect information volunteered by the user, such as survey information or contest entries.

We collect and store the domain name of AdAge.com users in our log files and use this information for audits and analysis.

Users electing to search the archives of AdAge.com are required to supply personal and professional information during a "registration" process prior to using the search function. At that stage, a user can indicate on the registration form that he or she does not wish to receive promotional information from Ad Age and/or its advertisers and partners via email or postal mail. Ad Age Group retains the right to contact a registered user regarding account status or changes to the registration agreement.

Information collected about users may be used by The Ad Age Group to perform statistical analysis of user behavior in order to measure interest in the various areas of our site (for product development purposes) and to inform advertisers as to how many users have seen or "clicked" their advertising banners. We will disclose user information to third parties only in aggregate. Personal information, including e-mail addresses, of individual users will not be provided to any third party unless the user has approved such use.

Upon request, The Ad Age Group will remove any registrant (and their personal information) from our database pursuant to a request from the registrant, including full name and user name, to [webinfo@adage.com](mailto:webinfo@adage.com), or allow any registrant to "opt out" of further contact (while still allowing access to the search function) or change/correct personal information online at <http://adage.com/register.html>.
