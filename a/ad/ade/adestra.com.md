## Our Clients

Adestra provides web-based marketing applications that have been designed to help companies manage and execute permission-based, multi-channel marketing campaigns. When we work with our clients, we insist that our software is used ethically.

We never knowingly participate in the distribution of unsolicited material and attempt to actively educate our clients so that they can not only achieve optimum results from their marketing campaigns, but also build trusted customer relationships.

We use security measures to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. Our business involves hosting application accounts; therefore applying the highest standards of data security is paramount.

Adestra respects every individual’s right to have their details removed from any client mailing list at any time, and provides tools to make the unsubscribe process as straightforward as possible. If you wish to unsubscribe from our clients’ email communications, just click on the unsubscribe link at the bottom of the email you have received.

For enquiries concerning your permission and privacy rights, either as a client or email recipient, please email: [moreinfo@adestra.com](mailto:moreinfo@adestra.com)

We never share data belonging to our clients or recipients of emails with any third parties and discourage our client base from selling their data. Our opinion on the use of ‘spam’ (unsolicited commercial email) is that it has a negative impact on the Internet and those who use it. It squanders resources and wastes the time and money of recipients. Ultimately, spamming can have a very damaging effect on a company’s reputation.
