### How we use your information

  1. To provide you with the services you expect us to, like participating in the Davis Cup work experience according to terms and conditions stated in the site;
  2. To find you suitable jobs/assignments to apply for, helping you with training, or facilitating the process of applying for jobs/assignments. This includes sending your CV to prospective employers for their consideration and keeping you informed of future work opportunities by email, telephone, mail and/or other communication methods; 
  3. to respond to your request or questions when you contact us.
  4. to send to you other information – such as Adecco upcoming events or newsletters – that may be of interest to you.
  5. to further develop, test and improve our website, or other existing or new systems/processes to better serve you; this mainly takes place in the context of new IT systems and processes, so that information about you may be used in the testing of those new IT systems and processes where dummy data cannot fully replicate the operation of that new IT system; 
  6. to perform studies and statistical and analytical research, for example to compare the effectiveness of our placement of candidates between different business sectors and geographies and seek to identify factors that might influence any differences we identify; 
  7. to transfer data to third parties (see below); 
  8. where necessary, to comply with any legal obligation; and

    * promote the security and protection of people, premises, systems and assets;
    * monitor compliance with internal policies and procedures;
    * administer communications and other systems used by the Adecco Group (including internal contact databases); 
    * investigate or respond to incidents and complaints;

  * necessary for our legitimate interests in pursuing the purposes set out above, and such interests in each case not being overridden by your privacy interests; 
  * in some cases, necessary to meet our legal or regulatory responsibilities, such as disclosures to authorities, regulators or government bodies; or 
  * in some cases, necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest and, when we use special categories of personal information, necessary for establishing. exercising or defending legal claims or where the processing relates to personal information manifestly in the public domain;

We will keep your information for the longer of the period required in order to meet our legal or regulatory responsibilities. The retention periods of your personal information depend on the respective purpose the data are processed for and the respective tool such personal information are processed in.

### Do you have to give us the personal information we ask for?

You are not obliged to provide your personal information to us, but it is more or less impossible for us to work with you and provide our services if you do not.

### Do we process information about you without any human intervention at all?

Yes we do at times. Adecco may use automated systems/processes and automated decision-making (like profiling) to provide you, and our clients, with the services you request from us. For example, when our clients are looking for candidates for jobs, we may conduct a search of our lists of candidates using automated criteria which takes into account your availability, skillset, pay rate and in some circumstances previous feedback we have received from clients to compile a shortlist which ranks which candidates are most likely to fulfil the client’s requirement. This means that sometimes your position in the rank may be higher than others, depending on how these factors match the clients needs.

### Sharing with third parties

To facilitate our efficient use of your information, and to provide you with the content and/or resources, we disclose your information to third parties. However, this disclosure will only occur in the following circumstances:

To suppliers, contractors and agents. From time to time we may engage or employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. We may, for example, engage a supplier to carry out administrative and operational work in support of our relationship with you. The supplier(s) will be subject to contractual and other legal obligations to preserve the confidentiality of your data and to respect your privacy, and will only have access to the data they need to perform their functions; the relevant suppliers are typically IT suppliers (who host or support our IT systems, including information about you), premises management companies (who look after physical security at our buildings, and therefore may need to know about you to allow access to our buildings) and back office finance and accounting management providers (who might need to handle details of candidates in order to process accounts payable and receivable). We may also engage suppliers who provide IT technology services and solutions, which might include video interview and skills assessment tools;

Such recipients will only have access to your personal information as required by them to perform their functions, and are not permitted to use such personal information for any other purposes. These recipients will be subject to contractual confidentiality obligations.

  * information is also shared with Adecco affiliates world-wide where you have expressed an interest in opportunities in that market, or members of the Adecco Group identify that you may have particular skills required or helpful in that market.

  * To our clients/prospective employers: we will share your data with clients of ours who are offering jobs/assignments you may be interested in, or who are interested in your profile. They owe contractual and other confidentiality obligations in relation to your data to us, and to you;
  * We will share your data with government, police, regulators or law enforcement agencies if, at our sole discretion, we consider that we are legally obliged or authorised to do so or it would be prudent to do so; and
