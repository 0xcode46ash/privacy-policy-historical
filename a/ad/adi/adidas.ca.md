### 2. What personal information/data is collected

  
All our activities are based on stringent ethical principles and we are committed to providing a good level of protection for the privacy of all visitors to our website and our (mobile) applications. For this reason, the way in which we collect and store information is dependent on how our website and related services are used.

  
To register with adidas, you only need to enter your e-mail address and a password, and confirm that you are over the age of 16. We may request your birth date for the purpose of sending you special offers on your birhday, but it is optional for you to provide this infomration to us.  
 

### 2.1 Data collected by automated means

  
Various technologies may be used on our websites and our (mobile) applications in order to make them more user-friendly, effective and secure. Such technologies may lead to data being collected automatically by us or by third parties on behalf of us. This data does not generally contain personal details about the user. Examples of such technologies are cookies, flash cookies and web analytics.  
 

### 2.1.1 Click-stream data  
 

A visit to one of our websites results in data that is transmitted from your browser to our server being automatically collected and stored by us or by third parties on behalf of us. This data can include, in particular, the following:  
• the visitor’s IP address  
• the date and time of the visit  
• the referral URL (the site from which the visitor has come)  
• the pages visited on our website  
• information about the browser used (browser type and version, operating system, etc).  
 

### 2.1.2 Cookies  
 

A number of places on our website and (mobile) applications make use of so-called cookies. These are essentially small text files that are stored on your computer’s hard drive or your user device by your web browser. We can use cookies to identify the owner of a user account and to store articles in a shopping basket during the purchasing process. In other words, cookies help to make our website or (mobile) application more user-friendly, more effective and more secure. The cookies usually used by us are so-called “session cookies”, which are automatically deleted at the end of the visit to the respective website. By default, browsers enable the use of cookies but this function can also be disabled. However, this will result in some services not being available. It is also possible to manually delete cookies after their use via the web browser. adidas is not aware of any cases in which cookies have caused damage to a computer or user device or facilitated viral infections.  
 

The following links provide specific information about the most commonly used browser:

A special form of cookie is the so-called flash cookie. In contrast to normal cookies, these cookies are not created and saved by the browser but are governed by the Adobe Flash plug-in.

You can also obtain more information about these cookies on that website.  
 

### 2.1.4 Web beacons and tracking links

  
Web beacons (also known as pixel tags and clean GIFs) involve graphics that are not apparent to the user. Tracking links and/or similar technologies consist of a few lines of programming code and can be embedded in our website or (mobile) application. In conjunction with cookies, these are primarily used for statistical analysis purposes. This technology can also be used for tracking traffic patterns on websites, as well as finding out if an e-mail has been received and opened and to see if there has been any response.  
 

### 2.1.5 Web analytics

  
Web analytics is the term given to a method for collecting and assessing the behaviour of visitors to websites and (mobile) applications. This includes the analysis of traffic patterns in order, for example, to determine the frequency of visits to certain parts of a website or (mobile) application, or to find out what information and services our visitors are most interested in.

The necessary steps are taken to ensure that our service providers and the processors working on behalf of adidas protect confidentiality of your data.   
 

There may be occasions on which we disclose non-personal data to our partners in an anonymous form.

Such information is generally only disclosed in a ‘bundled’ form.

### 7. Protection of children’s personal data  
 

The protection of children’s personal data is extremely important. adidas understands that it has a responsibility to protect the privacy of children and has no intention of collecting the data of children under the age of 16. We also encourage parents and other guardians to surf the Internet together with their children and participate with their children in the multitude of activities offered by the wide range of websites on the World Wide Web (www).  
 

If a child under the age of 16 attempts to register himself or herself, he or she is initially asked to provide the information as described in the above section entitled “What personal data is collected”. In addition, the data submitted by and collected about the child during the course of his or her visit (e.g. via cookies) may be used as described above.  
 

If a child under the age of 16 attempts to submit a registration application, this will be rejected with the notification that applications from children under the age of 16 are not accepted. For that reason, we ask parents and other guardians to check on and monitor their children’s Internet usage in order to protect them.  
 

### 8. Social Networks  
 

Our website and (mobile) applications provide you Social Plug-ins from various social networks. If you choose to interact with a social network, your activity on our website or via our (mobile) applications will also be made available to social networks such as Facebook and Twitter.   
 

If you are logged in on one of these social networks during your visit to one of our websites or (mobile) applications the social network might add this information to your profile. If you are interacting with one of the Social Plug-ins, this information will be transferred to the social network. In case you do not wish such a data transfer, please log off on your social network before you enter one of our websites or (mobile) applications.   
 

We cannot influence this data collection and data transfer via the Social Plug-ins. Please read the privacy policies of those social networks for detailed information about the collection and transfer of personal data, what rights you have and how you can achieve satisfactory privacy settings.

### 9. Geolocation Services  
 

We offer location-enabled services within some of our (mobile) applications, such as Google Maps and Bing Maps. If you use those (mobile) applications, they may receive information about your actual location (such as GPS signals sent by a mobile device) or information that can be used to approximate a location. You are always asked if the Geolocation Service can be activated and you can also object to this

Geolocation Service within the respective (mobile) application.   
We use the Google Maps service or the Bing Maps service to assist you in finding the next adidas store. To facilitate this, we load an image from Google Maps or Bing Maps, saving the route data and map image on our server.  
For further Information on Google Maps and their privacy policy please read their privacy policy.

### 10. Web analytics by Adobe Site Catalyst   
 

The web analytic services on our website and (mobile) applications are provided by Adobe Site Catalyst ([www.adobe.com](http://www.adobe.com/)). This means that when you visit our website or (mobile) applications, a cookie by Adobe Site Catalyst will be stored on your computer or mobile device, except when your browser settings don’t allow for such cookies (see 2.1.2 before).   
 

This further means that when you visit our website or (mobile) application, the web analytics data described above in chapter 2 – including the “click-stream data”, the data from “web beacons and tracking links” and information stored in Adobe Site Catalyst’ cookies – will be sent to Adobe Site Catalyst for analysis for and on behalf of adidas. Please note that if you have created an online profile at our website or (mobile) application and if you are logged on in this profile, a unique number identifying this profile is also being sent to Adobe Site Catalyst in order to be able to match the web analytics data to this profile.   
 

Adobe Site Catalyst acts as an agent to adidas, which means that adidas solely determines the purposes for which the data is being used and that Adobe Site Catalyst will not disclose the information to any third parties (except when required to do so by law or court order). In privacy terms, this means that adidas is the “controller” and Adobe Site Catalyst the “processor”. You can find out more about the relationships between adidas and Adobe Site Catalyst in the Adobe’s privacy policy under “Adobe Hosted Services” at <http://www.adobe.com/privacy/policy.html>.  
 

If you do not wish information about your behaviour at our website or (mobile) application being collected and assessed by Adobe Site Catalyst, you can apply for a visitor opt-out. This means that Adobe Site Catalyst will, depending on the type of opt-out you choose, either anonymise the information it collects (but keeps collecting the data) or stop collecting information about your visit at all. This visitor opt-out requires you to accept a cookie being stored on your computer by Adobe Site Catalyst. You can apply for the visitor opt-out on the link in the privacy policy section of the Adobe Site Catalyst website (<http://www.adobe.com/privacy/policy.html>).   
 

### 11. Re-targeting Technologies  
 

Our website and (mobile) application use re-targeting technologies within the internet. This enables us to show our visitors, who were already interested in our shop and our products, advertisements from us on partner websites. We believe that the display of a personalised, interest-based advertising is more interesting for our customers than advertising that does not have a personal connection.  
We also work with other companies who use tracking technologies to serve ads on our behalf across the Internet. These companies may collect non-personally identifiable information about your visits to our websites or (mobile) applications and your interaction with our communications, including advertising. You can opt out of receiving these advertisements by following the instructions available here: http:/www.criteo.com/privacy/.  
 

Re-targeting technologies analyse your cookies and display advertisement based on your past surfing behaviour. You can use your browser settings to block cookies. For further information on cookies, please refer to section 2 of this privacy policy.   
 

We do not store any personal information data about you with this technology and the usage of our retargeting technology is in compliance with applicable privacy laws.
