When you use our services you may provide us with personal information, such as your post address and payment details when ordering from our web shop and your email-address when signing up for one of our contests or newsletters. If you have been in contact with our Customer Service we will also register our correspondence.

We also offer a number of apps which allow you to upload and/or store certain information. Depending on the app, this information may also include sport data and body measurements, such as weight, height and heart rate. We will only use this sensitive information for providing you with the functionality of the app. Any further use of such information will be subject to your explicit and informed consent.

In addition, once you are a Member, you may choose to provide us with additional information, such as your interests and preferences, through the relevant online Community "dashboard". For example, where you become a Member of Front Row, you could provide us with your preferences in relation to running, so that we may tailor any information we send you accordingly.

As a Member you will automatically be entered into any Prize Giveaways. If you are a winner of such a Prize Giveaway, we may ask you for additional information, such as your postal address, clothes or shoe size, in order to be able to send you the prize.

i. publishing the first name, first letter of the surname and the City/Town of the winners of Prize Giveaways on our website. If you have not already provided this information through the "dashboard" we will ask you if you would like to provide this to us, so that we can announce you as a winner; and/or

ii. publishing the photographs of the winners of Prize Giveaways, in which case we will ask you if you would like to provide us with a photograph, for example, where you are wearing/holding your prize. Such photograph may capture your sensitive personal information, such as your race/ethnicity, any health condition, religious or other beliefs.

By providing your surname and/or City/Town or any additional details, such as your photograph, you expressly consent to the use of such personal information, including any sensitive personal information, images or other likeness in promotional material for our promotional purposes, which may include digital and online media, printed media, social media for publicity activities related to or in connection with the Prize Giveaway.

## SHARING INFORMATION

We treat your data with care and confidentiality and do not share your data with third parties other than as explicitly addressed in this privacy statement or when you expressly agreed to so.  
 

### With other adidas Group entities or partners

We may share anonymised and aggregated information about our consumers with other members of the adidas Group or our partners, for example to be used for trend analysis. This data is anonymised and does not relate back to individual consumers.  
 

### With service providers

We use various companies which process data on our behalf, such as hosting companies, delivery services, payment providers and credit scoring agencies. These companies use your information on our behalf, and are subject to strict rules they need to adhere to in order to process your information. It is strictly forbidden for such companies to use the data in any other way than as per the instructions of adidas. When data is stored outside the EEA, for example in the US, we will provide an adequate level of protection for the data transferred.  
 

### Legal and law enforcement

adidas does not voluntarily disclose personal information at the request of law enforcement agencies or third parties, and will only disclose data by order of a valid injunction from a court or law enforcement agency.  
 

### With your consent

We will only further share your information with companies or individuals when we have your valid consent to do so. For instance, we may share information with companies such as fitness centres if you provide us with your consent to do so.  
 

## SOCIAL NETWORKS

Our website and apps may provide you with social plug-ins from various social networks. If you choose to interact with a social network (for example by registering an account), your activity on our website or via our apps will also be made available to social networks such as Facebook and Twitter.

If you are logged in on one of these social networks during your visit to one of our websites or apps, the social network might add this information to your respective profile on this network. If you are interacting with one of the social plug-ins, this information will be transferred to the social network. In case you do not wish such a data transfer, please log off on your social network before you enter one of our websites or apps.

We also offer the opportunity to create an adidas account through your social network account (such as Facebook). This will save you time in creating an adidas account, as your sign-on credentials will be imported your social network account. Please note that when you use this "social sign-on" option, adidas may receive certain information via the social network, such as your name, age, location, preferences, occupation, and other information from your public profile, and possibly also access to your pictures or lists of your friends on the social network. This information is not requested by adidas, but is provided by the social network through the use of the social sign-on option. When you use the social sign-on option, adidas will only import the information that is necessary for the creation of your adidas account and will, upon receipt of any other information, discard that information received through the social network. After having created your account, you will have the opportunity to supplement it with any information you want to share with us.

Please read the privacy policies of those social networks for detailed information about the collection and transfer of personal data, what rights you have and how you can achieve satisfactory privacy settings.

## RETARGETING

Our websites and apps use re-targeting technologies. This enables us to show our visitors, who were already interested in our shop and our products, advertisements from us on partner websites. We believe that the display of a personalised, interest-based advertising is more interesting for our customers than advertising that does not have a personal connection.

We also work with other companies who use tracking technologies to serve ads on our behalf across the Internet. These companies may collect information about your visits to our websites or apps and your interaction with our communications, including advertising.

Re-targeting technologies analyse your cookies and display advertisement based on your past surfing behaviour. [Please click here for further information on cookies and instructions on how to disable re-targeting – link to cookie annex].

## SECURITY

We are committed to protect your information and have taken appropriate technical and organisational measures to protect your information against any loss, alteration, access or misuse. We will typically keep your information for a limited time of two years counted from your last interaction with us, unless a longer retention period is required by law or necessary in the course of legal proceedings.

Unless stated otherwise, your information is stored and processed within the European Union.
