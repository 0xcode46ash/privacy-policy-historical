## Information we collect from visitors

## What kind of information do we collect?

There are cases where adidas may ask you for personal information, such as your name, address, date of birth, gender, email address, etc. We do this for instance when you register for contests/promotions, respond to communication such as e-mail, and for services that require registration or subscription. If you would like to be on our mailing list, we will ask you to actively opt-in. We might also collect personal information from you about a third party, for instance if the website allows you to sent an e-postcard, in which case we need to know the name and e-mail address of the recipient. That information will only be used for the specific purpose (delivering the e-postcard) and adidas will not further contact the third party unless the third party contacts us. 

We use ‘cookies’ to gather information about your visits to our website and enhance your experience. You can find more information on how we use cookies in the section ‘Use of Cookies’. When you visit our website we collect so called ‘click stream’ data (server address, domain name etc). This information can be combined with information you have provided to us (for instance by registering), which will enable us to analyze and better customize your visits.
