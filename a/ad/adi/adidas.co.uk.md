We will also use various technologies to determine location, such as sensor data from your device that may, for example, provide information on nearby Wi-Fi access points, Near Field Communication ("NFC") points and mobile network cell towers. You can generally disable sending your location through settings in your device, and we will inform you when we make use of location information.

In addition, we may use your age, year of birth or confirmation that you are above a certain age to ascertain whether you meet the minimum age in your country for online purchases and whether you are considered to be a minor for data protection and/or marketing law purposes.
  * Carrying out checks: we will also use your personal information to assess your creditworthiness and to prevent fraud. For this purpose, we may need to share your personal information with our credit rating providers (see "how we share your personal information" below).
  * Customer service: if you contact our Customer Service (or vice versa), we will use personal information such as your order information and contact history to process your request and provide you with the best service possible.
  * adidas products and services, engagements and offerings: we will use your personal information to provide you with the products and services you have requested from us, such as promotions, membership of adidas Communities, adidas loyalty programs, events and our apps. This will, if applicable, include the use of your personal information for submission in contests, Prize Giveaways and promotions, using your contact details for events and using information like your location for our mobile apps (such as running apps). 
    * adi Program: if you choose to participate in the adi Program, we will use your contact details to send you a welcoming email to verify your username and password, to communicate with you in response to any inquiries and to send you service related announcements, for instance if the adi Program app is temporarily suspended for maintenance.

    * adidas apps: if you choose to download an adidas app, we will only collect special categories of personal information if we have obtained your express consent, as required by applicable law. Personal and sensitive personal information (such as health data) collected through the app will be collected from your device and stored on adidas servers for the following purposes: 
      * to provide you the services you expect when using the app;
      * to analyse your performance activity for the purposes of granting you rewards based on your performance activity (if you have agreed to participate in a performance activity within the adi Program);
      * for the reasons set out in the "improving our products and services" section below; and
      * for the reasons set out in the "marketing purposes" section below.  
 
    * adidas Communities: as part of an adidas promotion, we will publish certain details of the winners of any Prize Giveaways on our website or one of our affiliate's or service provider's websites according to the terms and conditions of the particular promotion.


  * Social sign-on (this means the use of your social network credentials such as your Facebook user login information to create and sign into your adidas account: when you use the social sign-on option adidas limit use of public profile information to that which is necessary for the creation of your adidas account. adidas will, upon receipt of any irrelevant information from the social network, discard such information. After having created your account, you will have the opportunity to supplement it with any information you would like to share with us, such as personal information you provide through a completed survey. Any supplemental information you provide to us will be used for the purposes explained in this statement, including to enrich your adidas profile and to personalise your adidas experience.
  * Marketing: when you signup to receive adidas newsletters, create an adidas account (or merge existing adidas accounts) and consent to our use of your personal information, become a Member of an adidas Community, join the adi Program, use an adidas app, order or provide feedback on a product or service online or use our website, we will use your personal information to create a profile based on the information we hold about you. We create this profile in order to provide you with the best personalised experience, to send you personalised marketing messages and newsletters and for opinion research purposes. Below you can find a more detailed description of the ways in which we will use your personal information for these purposes. 
    * What kind of information: the way you interact with our brand and the information we collect in that regard provides us valuable information about your interests and preferences. This insight gives us the opportunity to offer you the best adidas experience possible. To learn about you and your interests, we analyse your interactions with our brand using various kinds of information, as set out above.  If you have given us your consent to send you marketing communications, we use the information that you have provided to us when interacting with us for sending you personalised marketing messages about adidas products or services, events, Prize Giveaways and promotions. In some instances we will also aggregate your personal information with that of other individuals, to create comprehensive reports about how customers use our products and services, and experience our brand.
    * What kind of channels: we will send direct marketing communications to you via the channel you choose,  such as email, phone, or social media. We ask for your consent, where required by applicable law, in order to use the contact details you have provided to us to send our personalised marketing communications.  
    * What kind of messages: the messages we will send you will be personalised and tailored to your individual preferences and interests. We use analytics in order to generate such personalised messages. These direct marketing messages may contain information about our products and services, events, Prize Giveaways or promotions and adidas news. We will, in certain circumstances, also use the channels for opinion research (such as to ask if you would like to participate in a survey) and to learn about your experience and improve your experience with adidas, including by sending you personalised messages.


  * Re-targeting: our websites and apps use re-targeting technologies. This enables us to show our visitors, who were already interested in our shop and our products and/or services, advertisements from us on partner websites. We believe that the display of personalised, interest-based advertising is more interesting and relevant to our customers than advertising that does not have a personal connection. Re-targeting technologies analyse your cookies and display advertisements based on your past web-surfing behaviour. Please click here for further information on cookies and instructions on how to disable re-targeting. Note that our sites generally are not configured to respond to web browser do-not-track signals.
  * Ads: we also work with non-adidas companies who use tracking technologies to serve ads on our behalf across the Internet. These companies may collect personal information about your visits to our websites or apps and your interaction with our communications, including advertising.
  * Enrichment of our data: where we have obtained your personal information from various sources we will combine this information in certain circumstances in order to enrich our understanding of your requirements and preferences in relation to our adidas products and services. For example, we may combine information you have provided us directly with information collected automatically.  , such as metadata or IP addresses or where we have collected anonymous browsing data through the use of cookies, we may later determine that this data relates to your browsing history and combine that data with the existing information we hold on you. We may use the information we hold to correlate your interactions with us via one device (such as a browser on a computer) with your interactions with us via another device (such as an app on a phone). Specifically, we may carry out any of these exercises to be able to send you more personalised marketing or to prepare more effective marketing campaigns.
  * Improving our products and services: we will use the personal information we hold about you (as well as pseudonymised or anonymised information generated from your personal information) to carry out analysis and research, including: 
    * data science/analytics, whereby we combine information (such as personal information and/or sensitive personal information we have obtained through the use of an adidas sporting app or from your browsing history) we hold on a large scale in order: 
      * learn more about our customers and their preferences;
      * to identify patterns and trends amongst our customers;
      * enhance user experience on our websites;
      * provide information, content and offerings tailored to our customers' needs;
      * for general research and statistical purposes; and
      * for aggregated reporting purposes within the adidas group;
    * develop new products and services;
    * monitor performance of our products and services and/or improve our technology;
    * to be able to send you personalised marketing messages;
    * to display online ads to you.


  * Websites: personal information collected through our websites, such as via cookies or other tracking technologies, will be used to allow us to assess browsing behaviours on our websites, to understand where improvements can be made, to optimise our products and services and personalise and improve your experience on our websites and apps.
  * Global account: when you sign up for an adidas account we will verify whether your email address has previously been used within the adidas group. If this is the case, we will present you with the option of combining your adidas accounts and importing the information from your existing account by logging in.
  * Performance analysis: we will use your personal information (including by anonymising and aggregating it with other customer's personal information) for sales, supply chain and financial analysis purposes, to determine how adidas is performing and where improvements can be made and where necessary to report back to our parent or affiliate group companies.
  * We will ask for your consent if we wish to use your personal information for purposes other than those listed in this privacy statement and as required to do so under applicable law.



## **HOW WE SHARE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION**

We treat your personal information with care and confidentiality and do not share it with third parties other than as set out below:

###   
**With other adidas Group entities**

We will share your personal information as well as anonymised and aggregated information with other members of the adidas Group (such as adidas A.G., the parent company of the group, and/or other adidas entities as necessary). They will use this personal information for trend analysis.

###   
**With service providers**

We will share your personal information as necessary and only for the purposes described above with various third parties who process your personal information on our behalf, such as third parties that run our loyalty program and/or Prize Giveaways/competitions, hosting, delivery, payment and fraud management providers and credit scoring agencies. We require that these third parties adhere to strict rules when processing your personal information, including to only use your personal information in accordance with adidas' instructions and the applicable laws.

### **With social networks**

Our website and apps will, in certain circumstances, provide you with social plug-ins from various social networks. If you choose to interact with a social network such as Facebook or Twitter (for example by registering an account), your activity on our website or via our apps will also be made available to that social network. If you are logged in on one of these social networks during your visit to one of our websites or apps or are interacting with one of the social plug-ins, the social network might add this information to your respective profile on this network based on your privacy settings. If you would like to prevent this type of data transfer, please log out of your social network account before you enter one of our websites or apps, or change the app's privacy settings, where possible. Please read the privacy policies of those social networks for detailed information about the collection and transfer of personal information, what rights you have and how you can maintain suitable privacy settings for your needs.

### **With legal and law enforcement**

adidas will disclose personal information where required by law or legal process, for the administration of justice, to protect your vital interest, for investigations by law enforcement or regulatory bodies, to protect and defend adidas' property and legal rights, to protect the personal safety of adidas website or (mobile) app users or by order of a valid injunction from a court or law enforcement agency.

### **With your consent**

We will share your personal information with other third parties (different from those described above, for example, sports or fitness centres or when you decide to connect our devices with third party devices) in other limited circumstances. In these instances we will, where required by applicable law, obtain your consent to share your personal information in this way.

## **HOW WE PROTECT YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION**

We are committed to protecting your personal information and implement appropriate technical and organisational security measures to protect it against any unauthorised or unlawful processing and against any accidental loss, destruction, or damage.

## **RETAINING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION**

We will keep your personal information for two years from your last interaction with us, such as the date your account was deleted, your last purchase, the last time you used one of our apps or in some other way contacted or interacted, unless a longer or shorter retention period is required by law, is necessary in the course of legal proceedings or is otherwise needed for a particular purpose under applicable law.

The following are examples to illustrate how adidas keeps your personal information for as long as necessary for a particular purpose:

  * we may keep your personal information collected during a purchase for as long as required by tax laws (longer than 2 years in some European countries);
  * we may keep your personal information for a shorter period if you ask us to delete your personal information. In such a case, adidas will aim to delete your personal information within a maximum period of one month from the date of the request;
  * information collected in connection with promotions will be kept for no longer than one month following the end of the promotion.



## **INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION**

Unless stated otherwise, we store and process your personal information in the European Union. There will, however, be occasions when we need to transfer your personal information outside of the European Economic Area ("EEA") to a country which does not provide the same level of data protection as the country in which you normally use our products and/or services. In these circumstances we will take appropriate steps to ensure that your personal information is adequately protected. Typically, such steps include carrying out data security reviews of any recipients and putting in place contracts with such recipients to ensure they employ the same or similar appropriate technical and organisational measures as adidas, so your data is adequately protected.

## **INFORMATION ABOUT CHILDREN**

As a general rule, we do not intentionally collect personal information about children under the age of 13. If we become aware that we have inadvertently collected personal information about children under the age of 13, we will take steps to delete the information as soon as possible, except where we are required by applicable law to keep it.

Where we know a child is above the age of 13, but considered a minor under applicable law, we will obtain parental/guardian consent prior to using that child's personal information.

## **LINKS TO OTHER WEBSITES AND SERVICES**

Our websites may contain links to third party websites, and some of our services provide you with access to third party services (such as social networks).

We have no control over how third party websites and services process your personal information. We do not review third party websites and services, and we are not responsible for such third party websites and services or their privacy practices. Please read the privacy statements of any third party websites or services that you access from our websites or services.

## **YOUR RIGHTS IN RELATION TO YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION**

Fair play and transparency are important to us. We are open  about the personal information we collect and  have implemented  mechanisms  to enable you to  exercise any  rights you might have with respect to your personal information.

### **Access and correction of personal information**

If you have ordered products or services or registered an account with us, you can access a significant amount of your personal information through one of our websites. Our websites generally present you with the option to add, update or remove information we have about you

If any personal information we have about you is not accessible through our website, you can send us a request for access to this information at no cost using the contact details set out at the end of this privacy statement [insert link].

After receiving your request and sufficient information to verify your identity we will provide you with a copy of the personal information we have about you which you are entitled to have under applicable law. We will also confirm the purposes for which such personal information is being used, its recipients and the origin of the information

You may write to us at any time requesting amendments to certain personal information that you consider to be incorrect or irrelevant or to request that we block, erase or otherwise remove your personal information. We will update, block, erase or remove your personal information upon request in line with applicable law.

## **OPTING OUT AND UNSUBSCRIBING FROM MARKETING MESSAGES**

## **WHAT YOU SHOULD KNOW ABOUT COOKIES**

### **First of all… what are cookies?**

Cookies are small text files that are stored on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website. For this section, we conveniently use "cookies" as an umbrella term for techniques such as cookies, Flash cookies and web beacons. They don’t take much space and they will be removed automatically when expired. Some cookies expire at the end of your internet session, while others will be saved for a limited amount of time.

### **Secondly… what are the different cookie types we use?**

There are different types of cookies with different uses. Some are there just to allow you to browse the website and see certain features. Some give us an idea on your browsing experience, i.e. when you have trouble finding what you are looking for, so we can improve and make your future visit as pleasant as possible. 

Cookies set by adidas are called "first party cookies".  Cookies set by parties other than us are called "third party cookies".  Third party cookies enable third party features or functionality to be provided on or through the website (e.g. like advertising, interactive content and analytics).  The parties that set these third party cookies can recognise your computer or mobile both when it visits the website in question and also when it visits certain other websites.  We use first party and third party cookies for several reasons.

The most important cookies are the required cookies. They are essential and help you to navigate on the website and to use basic features, such as media plugins. Then there are functionality cookies that enable you to save your shopping bag, create a wish list and to save your shipping details for a quicker checkout. The performance and analytics cookies we use to improve our website. We also like to show you relevant offers. To manage this we collect browsing data, which may be linked to a unique identifier (click [here] for our privacy statement). Interaction cookies are used for you to interact with social media or to submit reviews.  Targeting cookies, advertising cookies and social media cookies capture your preferences in order to show you relevant ads outside adidas sites. In addition, social media cookies may be used to track your activity over social media platforms.

### **Next… why do we use cookies?**

adidas uses cookies primarily to ensure your visit to our website is as pleasant as possible, as well as for advertising-related purposes during your future visits to other websites. Below you see a more elaborate overview of the types of cookies we are using and why:

  1. REQUIRED COOKIES  
are essential and help you navigate, move around on the website and see certain features (e.g. these cookies make sure your basket is saved during all the steps of your checkout process). These cookies are required to enable core site functionality. These cookies are stored for the duration of your browsing session.
  2. FUNCTIONALITY AND ANALYTICS COOKIES  
are there so we can give you an even smoother customer experience (e.g. these cookies help you to save and remind you about your shopping bag and enable you to create a wish list). These cookies allow us to analyse site usage so we can measure and improve performance. These cookies may be placed by us or a third party on our behalf (see our cookie opt-out tool) and are stored for the duration of your browsing session.
  3. ADVERTISING AND SOCIAL MEDIA COOKIES


  * will remember your product and buying preferences or assist marketing efforts in other ways. These cookies enable us to share data, such as what you like, with our advertisers, so the advertisement you see can be more relevant to your preferences (sometimes referred to as "targeting cookies").
  * help us to understand shopping behaviour of visitors. This enables us to keep improving our website, so shopping becomes easier and more pleasant, and to improve the marketing messages we send to our customers (sometimes referred to as "performance cookies").
  * are used for you to express your opinion. These cookies will enable you to like or recommend us on social media and to chat with our service agents. But you can also advise our other (potential) customers by rating and reviewing our products (sometimes referred to as "interaction cookies").
