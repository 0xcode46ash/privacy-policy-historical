Privacy Policy

Thank you for visiting the Adirondack Solutions, Inc. website and reviewing our privacy statement. Our privacy policy is clear: We will collect no personal information about you when you visit our website unless you choose to provide that information to us.

**Information Collected**  
In the course of operating the Adirondack Solutions, Inc. Website, we may collect two types of information about our users: Personal Information and Non-Personal Information.

**Personal Information**  
Personal Information is personally identifiable information, such as your name, address, e-mail address, phone number, institution name, professional title, etc. We collect personal information when you choose to provide it to us when requesting information or services, such as when you submit a form from our Website or choose to sign-up for a user account. In addition, if you choose to contact our office, we may keep a record of that correspondence to fully address the subject matter.

Non-Personal Information is information of an anonymous nature, such as an Internet Protocol Address (IP Address), the date and time you access our site, the type and version of browser and operating system you are using, pages you visit, and the website you may have come from and visit next. Aggregate information, such as demographic statistics of our users (e.g. average age or geographical allocation of users), number of visitors and average time pent on our website or a specific page within the website, is also considered Non-Personal Information.

**Use of Personal Information**  
If you choose to provide us with personal information, as in an e-mail or by filling out a form with your personal information and submitting it through our website, that information is used to respond to your message or locate the information you have requested. We do not collect personal information for any purpose other than to respond to you, unless explicitly noted. Adirondack Solutions may also use Personal Information if it has reasonable grounds to believe the information could be useful when investigating a contravention of a federal, state, or foreign law in order to protect or defend a legal interest.
