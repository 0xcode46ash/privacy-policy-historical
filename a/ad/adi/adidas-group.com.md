# adidas Group - Privacy Statement

## **Group Online Privacy Policy**

## 1.         Who is in charge of the protection of your Personal data

The adidas AG, Adi-Dassler-Sraße 1, 91074, Herzogenaurach (hereinafter referred to as “adidas”) is the controller of data processing for this website according to the German Data Protection law (Bundesdatenschutzgesetz). For all mobile applications which refer to this policy adidas is the controller of the data processing. adidas is committed to take all responsibility for the protection and security of your personal data.

### 2.         What personal data is collected

All our activities are based on stringent ethical principles and we are committed to providing a good level of protection for the privacy of all visitors to our websites and our mobile applications. For this reason, the way in which we collect and store information is dependent on how our websites and related services are used. In certain cases, we will ask you directly to submit personal details, such as your name, address, date of birth, gender, e-mail address etc. In certain cases and to a limited extent, data may also be collected automatically. 

## 2.1       Data collected by automated means

Various technologies may be used on our websites and our mobile applications in order to make them more user-friendly, effective and secure. Such technologies may lead to data being collected automatically by us or by third parties on behalf of us. This data does not generally contain personal details about the user and is also not manually or automatically cross-referenced by us to personal data that may have been collected by us. Examples of such technologies are cookies, flash cookies and web analytics.

## 2.1.1    Click-stream data

A visit to one of our websites results in data that is transmitted from your browser to our server being automatically collected and stored by us. This data can include, in particular, the following:

  * the visitor’s IP address
  * the date and time of the visit
  * the referral URL (the site from which the visitor has come)
  * the pages visited on our website
  * information about the browser used (browser type and version, operating system, etc)



## 2.1.2    Cookies

A number of places on our websites make use of so-called cookies. These are essentially small text files that are stored on your computer’s hard drive by your web browser. We can use cookies to identify the owner of a user account and to store articles in a shopping basket during the purchasing process. In other words, cookies help to make our websites more user-friendly, more effective and more secure. The cookies usually used by us are so-called “session cookies”, which are automatically deleted at the end of the visit to the respective website. By default, browsers enable the use of cookies but this function can also be disabled. However, this will result in some services not being available. It is also possible to manually delete cookies after their use via the web browser. adidas is not aware of any cases in which cookies have caused damage to a computer or facilitated viral infections.

The following links provide specific information about the most commonly used browser:

Internet Explorer: <http://support.microsoft.com/gp/cookies/en>

Mozilla Firefox: <http://support.mozilla.com/en-US/kb/Cookies>

Google Chrome: [http://www.google.com/support/chrome/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=95647](http://www.google.com/support/chrome/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=95647)

Safari: <http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?path=safari/3.0/en/9277.html>

## 2.1.3    Flash cookies

A special form of cookie is the so-called flash cookie. In contrast to normal cookies, these are not created and saved by the browser but are governed by the Adobe Flash plug-in. These can contain more information than normal cookies and cannot be deleted or disabled via the browser; this is only possible using tools such as the [Adobe Flash Player](http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/de/flashplayer/help/settings_manager06.html) website. You can also obtain more information about these cookies on that website.

## 2.1.4    Web beacons and tracking link

Web beacons (also known as pixel tags and clean GIFs) involve graphics that are not apparent to the user. Tracking links and/or similar technologies consist of a few lines of programming code and can be embedded in our websites. In conjunction with cookies, these are primarily used for statistical analysis purposes. This technology can also be used for tracking traffic patterns on websites, as well as finding out if an e-mail has been received and opened and to see if there has been any response.

## 2.1.5    Web analytics

Web analytics is the term given to a method for collecting and assessing the behaviour of visitors to websites and mobile applications. This includes the analysis of traffic patterns in order, for example, to determine the frequency of visits to certain parts of a website and mobile applications or to find out what information and services our visitors are most interested in. For these purposes, we primarily make use of click-stream data and the other techniques listed above. Statistical evaluations are carried out anonymously. Web analytics are generally carried out by specialised companies commissioned by us for the task. However, these companies do not obtain any of your personal details although they do receive and process click-stream data. In order to evaluate the behaviour of visitors to our website and our mobile applications we generally use anonymous, permanent cookies that do not contain any direct personal data. The companies used for web analytics are contractually forbidden from using the data for other purposes and are contractually obliged to treat all data collected on our behalf in the strictest confidence.

## 2.2       Data provided by yourself

Besides the data collected by automated means, we also process data which you have provided to us. This includes but is not limited to:

  * Your e-mail address and date of birth when you participate in prize draws or other marketing competitions.
  * Job application data when you apply for a job, including your curriculum vitae.
  * Your e-mail address when you subscribe to the news feed or press releases.



The exact data that is collected depends on a range of factors, such as the required service or the desired form of communication. All of this data is characterized by the fact that you have provided this information yourself.

## 3.         How is the collected data used

We will only use your data for the purposes for which you submitted the information to us and as described in this policy statement. Exceptionally we may also use your data for purposes required or authorised by or under applicable law.

## 3.1       Job applications

If you submit a job application via one of the websites or in any other form, or submit queries regarding job applications, we may use the information submitted by you in order to come to a decision regarding entering into an employment relationship or in order to answer your query.

## 3.2       The use of anonymous information by us

Data collected by automated means helps us to evaluate how specific sections of our websites are used and to classify visitors (country of residence, how did the visitor end up on our website, etc.). This allows us to improve our websites and our mobile applications and ensure that they address the widest possible audience.

## 4.         Disclosure of information

One of our core principles states that your data shall be treated with confidentiality. We will not sell your data to third parties. If required by law your data will be disclosed to third parties. If required due to business requirements and provided that it is allowed under the applicable law, we will transfer your data to other companies of the adidas Group. In all other cases data will not be transferred without obtaining your prior consent.

We sometimes make use of service providers and of data processors working on behalf of adidas. These services can include hosting and maintanance services, analysis services, e-mail messaging services etc. These third parties are granted access to such personal data they require in order to be able to carry out the particular service. The service providers and data processors are contractually obliged to treat such information in the strictest confidence. It is also contractually forbidden for them to use the data in any other way than that required.

There may be occasions on which we disclose data to our partners in an anonymised form. Such anonymised data includes, for example, information about the number of visitors to a website or a mobile applications during a certain period of time. Such information is generally only disclosed in a ‘bundled’ form.

## 5.         Your rights

If you provide us with personal data via our websites or other channels, this is done on an entirely voluntary basis and with the granting of your consent for it to be used in accordance with the provisions of this online privacy policy. In certain cases, only those people that have submitted the necessary personal data to us are able to use certain services and in other ways avail themselves of the activities and offers available on our websites. As transparency and fair play are particularly important issues for us, we provide various options in order to help you retain control over your data. These options may include the possibility of displaying and editing your data online. It may also be possible to unsubscribe from services or delete user accounts or to receive information about the data held.

## 5.1       Right to object

With regard to e-mails that contain, for example, a newsletter or marketing content, you have the option to terminate the receiving of such e-mails (unsubscribe) by following the relevant instructions in the respective e-mail.  With regard to other types of message you may receive, such as maintenance announcements or administrational notifications, the receiving of these can only be terminated by deleting your account, as such messages are a mandatory part of user accounts and the related use of our websites or our mobile applications.

## 5.2       Right to request information

You have the right to be informed at any time about the personal data stored about you, its origin and recipients as well as the purpose for which it is being stored. Information about stored personal data can be obtained from our Group Data Protection Officer, who can be contacted using the address details in the Contact Information section below.

## 5.3       Right to request correction

You have the right to request to correct, supplement, delete or block the personal data stored about you. We will notify you within four weeks of receiving the request how we will comply with your request. If for any reason we don’t comply with your request, we will provide you with the reasons.

## 6.         Security of the information and data integrity

We take appropriate technical and organisational measures to protect personal data against accidental, unlawful destruction or accidental loss, alteration, unauthorised use, disclosure or access, in particular where the processing involves the transmission of data over a network, and against all other unlawful forms of processing and misuse.

## 7.         Protection of children’s personal data

The protection of children’s personal data is extremely important. adidas feels that it has a responsibility to protect the privacy of children and has no intention of collecting the data of children under the age of 14. We also encourage parents and other guardians to surf the Internet together with their children and participate with their children in the multitude of activities offered by the wide range of websites on the World Wide Web (WWW).

If a child attempts to register himself or herself, he or she is initially asked to provide the information as described in the above section entitled “2.What personal data is collected”. In addition, the data submitted by and collected about the child during the course of his or her visit (e.g. via cookies) may be used as described above.

If a child under the age of 14 attempts to submit a registration application, this will be rejected with the notification that applications from children under the age of 14 are not accepted. For that reason, we ask parents and other guardians to check on and monitor their children’s Internet usage in order to protect them.

## 8.         Social Networks

Our Websites and/or mobile applications provide you Social Plug-ins from various social networks. If you choose to interact with a social network, your activity on our website or adidas mobile application will also be made available to social networks such as Facebook and Twitter.

If you are logged on in one of the social networks during the visit on one of our Websites or mobile applications the social network might add this information to your profile. If you are interacting with one of the Social Plug-ins, this information will be transferred to the social network. In case you do not wish such a data transfer, please log off in your social network before you enter one of our Websites or mobile applications.

We cannot influence this data collection and data transfer via the Social Plug-ins. Please read the privacy policies of those social networks for detailed information about the collection and transfer of personal data, what rights you have and how you can achieve satisfactory privacy settings.
