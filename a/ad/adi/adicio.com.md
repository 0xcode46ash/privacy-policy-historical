## Disclosure of Information to Others

We do not disclose to third parties your personally identifiable information for promotional purposes, combined personal and demographic information or information about your use of an Adicio website (such as the areas you visit or the services you access), except as set forth below.

  1. We may disclose such information to third parties if you consent to such disclosure. For example, if you indicate that you would like to receive information about the products or services of third parties at the time you register for an Adicio account, we may supply your contact information to third parties such as employers, recruiters, agents, brokers, dealers, data aggregators, marketers or others for the purpose of sending you email or otherwise communicating with you.
  2. We may disclose such information to companies and individuals we employ to perform functions on our behalf. Examples may include hosting our web servers, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, processing credit card payments, and providing customer service. These companies and individuals will have access to your personal information as necessary to perform their functions, but they may not share that information with any other third party.
  3. We may disclose such information if legally required to do so, if requested to do so by a governmental entity or if we believe in good faith that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to legal requirements or comply with legal process; (b) protect the rights or property of Adicio or its affiliated companies; (c) prevent a crime or protect national security; or (d) protect the personal safety of users or the public.
  4. We may disclose and transfer such information to a third party who acquires all or a substantial portion of Adicio's business, whether such acquisition is by way of merger, consolidation or purchase of all or a substantial portion of our assets. In addition, in the event Adicio becomes the subject of a bankruptcy proceeding, whether voluntary or involuntary, Adicio or its trustee in bankruptcy may sell, license or otherwise dispose of such information in a transaction approved by the bankruptcy court. If such event occurs we will display a prominent notice on our website.



Adicio may also share aggregated anonymous information about visitors to each of our ASP Client's websites with its clients, partners and other third parties so that they may understand the kinds of visitors to Adicio's site and how those visitors use the site.

Adicio supplies technology, hosting and related services to other leading companies to power recruitment, real estate and motors areas on their websites (sometimes referred to as "private label areas"). Personal and/or demographic information supplied by you in private label areas becomes part of the Adicio database, but it is not accessible by anyone other than you, Adicio and the company concerned without your consent.

Information gathered on a page in a private label area, or on a co-branded page (such as that of a contest co-sponsored by Adicio and another company), may become the property of the other company or of both Adicio and the other company. In that instance, the use of such information by the other company may be subject to the privacy policy of that company and, in any event, Adicio is not responsible for that company's use of your personal or demographic information. If you apply for a position through a co-branded site, you may be asked to provide information on your age, gender or race. Some employers are required by law to gather this information from job applicants for reporting and record keeping requirements. You should understand that if provided, this information will be used by employers only in accordance with applicable law and will not be used in making any employment decisions. All information provided will be kept separate from your expression of interest in any job opportunity. Providing this information is strictly voluntary and you will not be subject to any adverse action or treatment if you choose not to provide this information.

## Widgets

Widgets support functions that require that you disclose certain personally identifiable information given the user's choice of participation. This information is collected in many different ways such as: forms, surveys, contests, forums, subscribing or unsubscribing to mailings and correcting or updating personally identifiable information and are only used for the purpose in which they were collected. Forms which require sensitive information such as financial information (credit card) to process purchases for products or services are SSL encrypted to protect your sensitive information.
