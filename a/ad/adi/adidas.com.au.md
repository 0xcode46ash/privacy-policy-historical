# adidas Privacy policy

**Australian Website Privacy Policy**

adidas Australia Pty Ltd (ABN 80 058 390 659) (adidas Australia) understands the importance of respecting and protecting the privacy of visitors to the adidas.com.au website. Using the internet should be a fun and non-threatening experience and we want to help make it so.This Website Privacy Policy explains how personal information may be collected through the adidas.com.au website, which company in the adidas Group ("adidas") is collecting that information, where the information is held and how it will be handled. 

**What is "personal information"?**

“Personal information” means information or an opinion, in any form and whether true or not, about an individual whose identity is apparent, or can reasonably be ascertained from, that information or opinion. It includes information such as your name, address, date of birth and phone number.

**Who collects personal information through the adidas.com.au website?**

The adidas Australia website (adidas.com.au) is managed and controlled by adidas AG (in Germany) and is hosted on its behalf on servers located in the USA. adidas Australia provides some content for the website, but does not ultimately manage or control the website as a whole. Personal information collected through the adidas Australia website is collected by adidas AG, stored on the USA servers and handled in accordance with adidas' Global Privacy Policy. Personal information you submit through the adidas Australia website will be transferred to the USA and by submitting the information you authorise this transfer. After its initial collection by adidas AG, adidas Australia may collect personal information about Australian website users from adidas AG. adidas Australia is required to comply with the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) when it collects and handles that personal information.

**What personal information is collected through this website?**

The type of personal information that adidas AG collects about you depends on how you use this website. For example, your personal information will be collected if you:   
\- register as a member of the adidas.com community;   
\- enter a competition or promotion offered through this website;   
\- complete and send an email query form; or   
\- register or subscribe for any other services available through the website from time to time.   
If you would like to be on the adidas mailing list, adidas will ask you to actively opt-in. adidas AG may also collect personal information from you about a third party, for instance if the website allows you to send an e-postcard, in which case adidas AG needs to know the name and e-mail address of the recipient. That information will only be used for the specific purpose (delivering the e-postcard) and adidas will not further contact the third party unless the third party contacts adidas. 

**Use and disclosure of your personal information**

Your personal information may be used by adidas AG (and adidas Australia if relevant):   
\- for the purposes explained at the time of collection;    
\- to administer a contest, promotion, survey or other site feature and to provide the relevant products or services to you (for example, to deliver prizes you may have won in a competition);    
\- to send you information/materials via e-mail or sms-messages about products, offers and news adidas thinks could interest you. This information may relate to products, offers and news of adidas and/or its licensees. adidas only sends you this if you have opted-in to receive adidas e-mails and/or sms messages. In case you do not want to receive any e-mails and/or sms messages from adidas anymore, please refer to the ‘Opt-out’ section below;   
\- to analyse visits to the website and learn about the interests of visitors in aggregate and also on a personal level to better understand your interests and needs, so adidas AG can improve its products and services and deliver to you the type of content, features and promotions that you are most interested in; and   
\- for any other purposes required or authorised by or under applicable law (which, in the case of adidas Australia, includes without limitation the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth)).   
For any of the above purposes, adidas AG may disclose your personal information to adidas Australia and other companies belonging to the adidas Group. Your personal information may also be disclosed to web site hosting partners and other parties who assist us in designing and operating the website, executing services (for instance prize fulfillment) or help us analyse collected data. These parties will only use your data for the purpose of carrying out the work as indicated and will be required to keep the information confidential.   
Otherwise, we will not disclose your personal information to third parties unless:   
\- you have consented to that disclosure (for example, at the time you provided us with your personal information);   
\- the disclosure is to organisations involved in a proposed or actual transfer or sale of all or part of the business or assets of adidas Australia or adidas AG; or   
\- the disclosure is otherwise required or authorised by or under applicable law (which, in the case of adidas Australia, includes without limitation the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth)).
