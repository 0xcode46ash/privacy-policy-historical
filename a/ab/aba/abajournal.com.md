 **Publication of Your Personally Identifiable Information for Membership Directories and Registration Lists.** To allow other lawyers and the public to find you, the Personally Identifiable Information we receive may be published on the Sites and other print or digital media, in a variety of ways, including, but not limited to, directories, membership lists, and other types of registration lists for ABA programs and events (“Directory Lists”). Directory Lists will not include sensitive information, such as credit card or bank information, or social security numbers. Users may request their information be suppressed from Directory Lists by [contacting us](http://www.americanbar.org/utility/about_the_aba/contact.html).

 **Sharing Your Personally Identifiable Information to Fulfill Service Requests and Perform Business Functions.** When fulfilling service requests initiated by you, we may share your Personally Identifiable Information with certain third parties to fulfill the requests. We may also share such information with service providers that perform business functions for us. For example, the ABA occasionally hires other companies to provide limited services on our behalf including, but not limited to, packaging, mailing and delivering promotional offers, sweepstakes or contests, answering customer questions about products or services, consulting services, data modeling, printing, sending postal mail and processing event registrations.  In such cases, the ABA may share your Personally Identifiable Information.  

 **Sharing Your Personally Identifiable Information with Certain Other Companies.** The ABA may share Personally Identifiable Information, except for Email addresses, with certain other companies in order to provide them an opportunity to offer products or services that may be of interest to you, which helps contribute non-dues revenue to the ABA. 

 **Sharing Your Personally Identifiable Information When Legally Necessary or to Protect the ABA’s Interests.** The ABA may disclose your Personally Identifiable Information if required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to legal requirements or comply with legal process served on the ABA; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of ABA; or (c) protect the personal safety of ABA personnel or members of the public in appropriate circumstances. In addition, if the ABA and/or its assets (or a portion of its assets) are sold, assigned, transferred, or merged, or if the ABA undergoes some other change including a change to its corporate form as part of a bankruptcy proceeding or otherwise, information may be transferred as part of that transaction or change. 

 **Sharing Your Email Address Pursuant to ABA Policy.** Your e-mail address will only be used by the ABA and its entities. We do not sell or rent e-mail addresses to anyone outside the ABA. The ABA will also not share e-mail addresses to unrelated third-parties, affiliates, or ABA members.  Please understand, however, that your Email address may be visible to other attorneys, others who have interest in the legal profession and ABA events, as well as the general public through Directory Lists as set forth above.  The ABA may also share your Email address with third parties to enable the ABA to take security measures to help protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure, or destruction of data.  Finally, the ABA may share Email addresses with third parties as necessary for the ABA to perform certain services on our behalf, such as packaging, mailing and delivering products and processing event registrations and to respond to your service requests.

### VI. How We May Use and Share Non-Personal Data

Through the use of various technological tools, we may collect Non-Personal Data to improve the usability of our Sites/Services and for other business reasons. We may share the Non-Personal Data we collect with third parties or permit third parties to place tools like cookies, tags and web beacons, to collect additional Non-Personal Data when you browse our Sites.

We do not share Personally Identifiable Information with third parties with whom we share your Non-Personal Data. **Please note that you may be subject to the privacy policies of other non-ABA companies when you select an advertising link or other link that takes you to sites not operated by the ABA.**

 **How You Can Manage the Collection of Non-Personal Data.** Third party advertising companies may collect data about your visit to our Sites and others to provide you more relevant advertising here and elsewhere on the Internet. This type of advertising is known as Online Behavioral Advertising. You can stop this collection and use of data for these purposes by companies participating in the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”) by visiting the “Opt Out From Online Behavioral Advertising” website. By opting out, the ads you see may be less relevant, and you may still continue to see other non-targeted advertisements on our Sites and elsewhere. 

### VII. California Privacy Rights

If applicable, this information would include the categories of personal information and the names and addresses of those businesses with which we shared such personal information for the immediately prior calendar year (e.g., requests made in 2012 will receive information about 2011). To obtain this information please write to us at: American Bar Association, 321 N. Clark St. Chicago, IL 60654. Attn: ABA List Sales -- California Privacy Law.

### VIII. Children

We do not knowingly collect personal data online from or market online to children under the age of 13.

### IX. Information Security

The ABA implements commercially reasonable security measures to help protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure, or destruction of data. Except for Directory Lists and the sharing of information as set forth in this Privacy Policy, we restrict access to personal information to certain companies who may need to know that information in order to operate, develop, or improve our services. These individuals or partner organizations are bound by confidentiality obligations and may be subject to discipline, including termination and criminal prosecution, if they fail to meet these obligations.

Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Accordingly, and despite our efforts, the ABA cannot guarantee or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us, or to or from our online products or services. If you have questions about this Privacy Policy, please [contact us](http://www.americanbar.org/utility/about_the_aba/contact.html).

### X. User ID and Password

Certain areas of the Sites may require the use of a user ID, email address, or password as an additional security measure that helps protect your information.  To help you protect your privacy, the ABA Sites have tools to help you log in and log out.

### XI. Linking to Other Internet Sites

You should be aware that other Internet sites that are linked from the Sites or from an ABA email message may contain privacy provisions that differ from the provisions of this Privacy Policy. To ensure your privacy is protected, we recommend that you review the privacy statements of these other linked sites, applications, or other digital platforms.

### XII. How You Can Access and Change Information
