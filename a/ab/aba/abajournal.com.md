## E-mail Information Gathered by the ABA

For some e-mails distributed by the ABA and its Sections, specific information on recipient response is collected. For example, we sometimes review how many recipients open and subsequently choose to click through to links provided in an e-mail. We use this information only for the purposes of analyzing areas of interest, improving our products and enhancing the usefulness of our website for ABA members and other visitors. None of this information is sold or distributed outside of the ABA in any manner. 

## The ABA's Support Level Agreement

The ABA is committed to providing 100 percent availability of its Internet site(s). We have implemented safeguards and alarms to notify us in the event of loss of Internet connectivity to the backbone and of hardware failures. Even with these safeguards in place, loss of connectivity or hardware failure can still occur. For this reason, the ABA cannot "guarantee" its Internet connectivity, nor can we be responsible for lost or delayed requests, email, or content. 

For questions regarding our web site being down or any related service outage, please send an email to [help@abanet.org](mailto:help@abanet.org). 

## Use of Cookies and IP addresses 

We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our Web site. Our site uses cookies to keep track of your shopping cart and to make sure you don't see the same ad repeatedly. We also use cookies to maintain user session identity, and, in some non-member areas, to store your username and password locally for ease of access. 

  * "Cookies" are small pieces of information that are stored by your browser on your computer's hard drive. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but if you prefer, you can edit your browser options to block them in the future.
  * A unique number called an IP address identifies every computer on the Internet. Each time you connect to the Internet your machine is assigned an IP address. An IP address is a number that identifies each sender or receiver of information that is sent in packets across the Internet.
