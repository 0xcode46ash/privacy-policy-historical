The ABA is committed to providing 100 percent availability of its Internet site(s) and email aliasing service. We have implemented safeguards and alarms to notify us in the event of loss of Internet connectivity to the backbone and of hardware failures. Even with these safeguards in place, loss of connectivity or hardware failure can still occur. For this reason, the ABA cannot "guarantee" its Internet connectivity, nor can we be responsible for lost or delayed requests, email, or content. 

For questions regarding our web site being down or any related service outage, please send an email to [help@abanet.org](mailto:help@abanet.org).

Our site's registration forms require users to give us contact information (like name and email address), method of payment, and demographic information. We use customer contact information from the registration forms to send the user information about our association. The customer's contact information is also used to contact the visitor when necessary. Information regarding method of payment is collected for member enrollment, registration and to process orders for products and services. 

ABANET.ORG contains links to other external web sites that do not fall under the ABANET.ORG domain. ABANET.ORG is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such external web sites. 

Our site uses an order form for customers to request information, products, and services. We collect visitor's contact information (like email address) and method of payment. Contact information from the order form is used to process orders and to send information about our association. User payment information that is collected is used to check the users' qualifications and bill the user for products and services. 

Our online surveys ask respondents for contact information (like email address) and demographic information (like zip code, age). We also may use contact data from our surveys to send the user information about our association. 

We run contests on some sections of our site in which we ask visitors for contact information (like email address) and demographic information. The customer's contact information is also used to contact the visitor when necessary. 

We use an outside ad company to display ads on our site. These ads may contain cookies. While we use cookies in other parts of our Web site, cookies received with banner ads are collected by our ad company and are used for advertisement banner rotation purposes only. 

This site makes chat rooms, forums, List Serves and message boards available to its users.

It is also not the ABANET.ORG's responsibility for maintaining the secrecy of any passwords you set up and/or any account information you have disclosed.
