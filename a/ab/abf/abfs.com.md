# ABF Freight System, Inc. - Privacy Policy

ABF® is committed to protecting your privacy. We use the information we collect to provide you the most robust Internet applications in the transportation industry. Please read on for more information on ABF's commitment to your privacy.

What information does ABF collect?
    We collect and store information about every shipment we handle so that we can efficiently provide the delivery services demanded by our customers. We use information about our customers, their shipments, and their shipping activity to provide or enhance the services we make available to our customers, to enhance our ability to communicate with our customers about additional services they may find of value, to set prices, establish credit, accomplish the billing function, and to comply with government regulations.

Some of the information collected by ABF is personal data or data which relates to an identifiable person. Examples of personal data are names, addresses, e-mail addresses and telephone numbers. We never sell information to third parties that could be used to specifically identify an individual customer or group of customers.

Information, including personal information (name, address and phone number), provided as part of a shipping transaction represents a record of that business transaction and cannot be altered after the transaction is complete.

Furthermore, the ABF Web site collects IP addresses, usage statistics, and browser information for system administration, security, and statistical analysis purposes. We log this information so that we can provide the most efficient service, enhance security, ensure appropriate usage and produce traffic volume statistics. 

How is my information saved and protected?
    We treat our data as assets that must be protected against loss and unauthorized access. We employ information security techniques to appropriately protect confidential information from unauthorized access by users inside and outside the company. Access to customer information is limited to those individuals who have a legitimate business need for that information.

ABF Internet sites are currently located in the United States. ABF Internet sites, and their supporting systems, employ generally accepted information security techniques such as firewalls, access control procedures and cryptography to appropriately protect confidential information from unauthorized access.

Your account and shipment information is stored in a central, secure source in our mainframe system. All calls from the Internet to access this information must pass through our secure site.

Although we make substantial efforts to limit access to our facilities and vehicles to authorized personnel, we are not responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of information that is printed and placed in plain view on a shipment or package.

How do I change my personal or company information?
    Registered users of myABF and/or the eCenter of Online Tools may contact their local sales representative or e-mail [passwords@abfs.com](mailto:passwords@abfs.com) to request a change to registration information. You are entirely responsible for any and all activities that occur under your account.

Personal information provided at the time of the ABF Web site registration will be deleted if the user does not access ABF.com within 6 months as a logged-on user.

Does the ABF site use cookies?
    Certain saved options are stored as an encrypted entry in your cookie file, enabling you to access the advanced features of this site without having to logon each time you enter the site. We believe cookies provide a safe and secure way to improve the usability of the site. Please note that we will never use cookies to find demographic information. For more information about cookies, read the [Cookie and Privacy FAQ](http://home.netscape.com/security/basics/privacy.html) at the Netscape site. 
Will ABF disclose the information it collects to third parties?
    Unless approved by you, ABF will not sell, rent or trade your information to others. In other words, all information about you stored on our site will never be released to anyone without your consent except to comply with valid legal processes, such as a search warrant, subpoena or court order, to protect the company's rights and property, or during emergencies when ABF believes physical safety is at risk.
Will ABF use this information to send me promotional materials?
    Registered users and ABF customers at times will receive newsletters and other promotional materials via e-mail. Clear instructions are always provided to opt-out of future e-mails. Furthermore, print materials are sent to ABF customers on a regular basis. You may also opt-out of these print mailings by contacting your local ABF sales representative.

Please note that by using the ABF Web site, you consent to the collection and use of this information by ABF. If we decide to change this privacy policy, alterations will be posted to this page. ABF is committed to protecting your privacy.

Comments, suggestions or materials sent or transmitted to ABF shall be deemed to be non-confidential. ABF shall have no obligation of any kind with respect to such comments, suggestions or materials and shall be free to use and distribute them to others without limitation, including, but not limited to developing and marketing products incorporating them.
