# Welcome to Online Shopping with abc!

  


Every time you visit [www.abcdistributing.com](http://www.abcdistributing.com/), our web server automatically recognizes only your domain name and only collects basic information to help us best serve your current and future shopping needs. This data includes the number of pages you visit as well as the Uniform Resource Locator (URL) of where you were on the Internet if you clicked a link to our site, any terms you may have used in a search which directed you to our site, and whether you came to our site from a bookmark. We cannot identify you individually from your screen name if you are using America Online or one of the other major online services. 

Naturally, if you request a catalog, we will need your name, the name of the company you work for (since abc distributing, inc. only sells to businesses) and an address where we should send the catalog. We will also ask for a phone number we can use to contact you if any of the information provided is incorrect (for example, if there is a typographical error.) If you wish to set up an account and purchase merchandise from us, we may ask for additional information. 

We also track the total number of visitors to our site in an aggregate form to allow us to update and improve our site; personally identifiable information is not extracted in this process.
