# Privacy Policy With Registration Software | ABC Signup

"ABC Signup provides a fast and easy online registration solution for all-sized groups. Principal Wellness Company has approximately 10 clients that utilize this tool, and having the option of giving each contact administrative rights dramatically cuts down on administrative work, and it puts the client in control of monitoring their registrations... Each group that uses it, continues to use it in the following years and comments how much easier it is than signing people up on paper!"Â  **Julie, Principal (Financial) Wellness Company**
