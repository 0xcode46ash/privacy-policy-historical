PRIVACY POLICY

Effective Date: 17 March, 2010

Introduction

Welcome to ABCmouse.com ("Site"), which is owned and operated by Age of Learning, Inc. We are committed to providing children with a learning environment where every activity is just as fun as it is educational. Parents and legal guardians ("Parents"), as well as teachers, can monitor children’s  progress as they participate in the entertaining and educational games and activities the Site offers. Our Privacy Policy applies to this Site, and to any downloadable applications made available through the Site or that interact with the Site and post this Privacy Policy. 

We will never send marketing messages to children, and children won’t see any advertisements or links to other websites on our Site. Children cannot communicate with anyone through the Site without express parental permission, and even then only to those Site members that the Parent selects. We will never ask your child to provide any Personal Information to us. Parents and teachers provide us only with a child’s first name, birth date and gender.

Summary of Key Points

You should read our entire Privacy Policy and also our [Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/tandc), but here are some key points we want to draw to your attention:

  * The Site is closed, meaning it is password protected and accessible only to registered members. 
  * Children cannot communicate with anyone on the Site absent Parental permission.
  * Only Parents, teachers and other Site members authorized by the Parent can see how children are progressing on the Site.
  * The Site may allow children to post certain content, such as in an art gallery, but a child’s Parent must give permission before the child can publicly post anything on the Site.

1\. Account Types.

The Site currently offers "Family Accounts" and two different types of "Classroom Accounts" (collectively, "Accounts"):

(a) Family Accounts. A Family Account has a maximum of four members, which includes the Parent, their child(ren) and other extended family members and friends designated by the Parent.  Each of these four members has their own login, and their Site progress, messaging, music, and artwork is separately tracked and saved.  The Parent may also add their child’s teacher to the Family Account, which does not count against the four-member limit.  (Please note that the teacher’s status as a public or private school professional educator must be independently verifiable through their school’s domain-specific email address as listed with Market Data Retrieval in order to be added to a Family Account free of charge.)  Only the Parent can determine whether, and with whom, their child(ren) can communicate on the Site, as well as who, if anyone, within their Family Account or within other linked Family Accounts can view their child(ren)’s progress on the Site.

(b) Classroom Accounts. We offer two types of Classroom Accounts: Free Classroom Accounts and Paid Classroom Accounts.  Our Free Classroom Accounts allow up to four users to be on the Site simultaneously.  Because these are not four _individual_ accounts, however, the users do not have separate logins, and their Site progress, music, and artwork is not tracked and cannot be saved. To be eligible for a Free Classroom Account, please note that the teacher’s status as a public or private school professional educator must be independently verifiable through their school’s domain-specific email address as listed with Market Data Retrieval.  Our Paid Classroom Accounts allow for individual memberships to be assigned to specific students, and just like with a Family Account, each student’s progress, music, and artwork is tracked and saved.  Additionally, our paid Classroom Accounts enable teachers to provide each of their students with individualized assignments. Teachers can also link Paid Classroom Accounts to a student’s Family Account via Parental consent, and Parents will have the opportunity to view their own child’s in-class progess on the Site (but not that of other children).  Please note that students cannot communicate with anyone or post or display any content while using either type of Classroom Account.  Both types of Classroom Accounts can only be established and managed by a teacher.

2\. Types of Information We Collect.

(a) Account Registration Information. When you register for an Account, we may ask you for certain personal identifying information, such as first and last name, e-mail address, credit card number, and physical address (" **Personal Information** "), as well as other demographic information, such as zip code.  For Family Accounts, the Parent provides us with the first name, gender and birth date of each child enrolled, and for other members they add to the Family Account, the individual’s first and last name, e-mail address and relationship to the child.  For paid Classroom Accounts, the teacher provides us with the first name, birth date and gender of each student enrolled.  Because there are no individual users in Free Classroom Accounts, we do not collect any information about the children using them.  In any event, please do not submit Personal Information for any person other than yourself and your own child(ren) without such person's permission to do so.

(b) Send-to-a-Friend. You may use our Site tools to invite friends to join our Site; we use the names and email addresses you provide to send the invitation.

3\. Tracking and Technology.

To create your best Site experience and deliver customized content, we use a variety of technologies, such as cookies, that automatically collect certain Site usage information, such as browser type, operating system, the page served and your IP address.  If you disable certain technologies, parts of the Site, such as the ability to track your child’s and student’s progress, may not work.

4\. How We Use the Information We Collect.

We may use the information we collect on the Site for our administrative and internal business purposes (such as Account registration and maintenance), to enhance the Site and your experience (such as to enable you to see how your child or student is progressing through the Site activities), for other purposes we may tell you about when you provide the information, and as set forth in this Privacy Policy.

5\. How Account Administrators Can Access, Change or Delete Information Provided to the Site.

Every Account has one designated Account Administrator.  For Family Accounts, a Parent must always be the Account Administrator when children are added.  For Classroom Accounts, a teacher must always be the Account Administrator.  All Accounts have management tools that permit an Account Administer to access, change or delete information provided to the Site through an Account, which are accessible via the “My Account” link on the Site.  For Family Accounts, the Account Administrator may add and remove Account members, as well as link and unlink their Account to other Family Accounts and to the Account Administrator of their child’s Classroom Account.  For paid Classroom Accounts, the teacher who is the Account Administrator may add and remove their individual students, although they should not provide any Personal Information for students.  We will make good faith efforts to make requested changes in our then- active databases as soon as reasonably practicable. When you edit or delete your information, such information may nonetheless persist internally for our administrative purposes.  Changing setting options may not result in immediate changes to the settings, which are subject to our operations and maintenance schedules. If a Parent believes that Personal Information of his or her child is on the Site in a manner that the Parent has not authorized, the Parent may contact us as set forth below in Section 8.

6\. When We Might Disclose Information to Third Parties.

We never share any Personal Information collected on the Site with third parties for their marketing purposes. We may share non-personally identifiable information, such as aggregated user statistics, with third parties, such as our business partners.  We may share your information, including Personal Information with third parties who perform certain services for us relating to the Site, such as to process credit cards.  We may also share your information, including Personal Information, with law enforcement agencies in response to a subpoena, to governmental agencies conducting an investigation, or if otherwise needed to protect the personal safety or property rights of any individual or our Site. We may share and transfer your Personal Information if all or a portion of our assets are sold or transferred to another company or entity.

7\. Communications To or From Us.

While we will do our best to respond to emails submitted to the Site via a "contact us" or other similar method, we may not always be able to respond to them immediately. On occasion, we may send  commercial messages to adult members about Site offerings or products or services designed to enhance their Site experience. Of course, you may always choose to stop receiving these messages by following the instructions contained in the message. We may invite adult members to receive updates and information about ABCmouse.com through a social networking mobile application or website. We may also send you certain Account-related communications, such as information about your child’s progress on the Site, a reminder that your Account is about to expire, or information about updated Site’s policies. However, you may not stop receiving these Account-related messages as long as you are a Site member.  While it is not our intention to send any messages to children, if you are a Parent that believes his or her child may have received such a message, please contact us as set forth below in Section 8.

8\. Children's Privacy Notice.

We do not ask children to provide any Personal Information while using the Site. In compliance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, however, we obtain the consent of Parents in order for children under 13 years of age ("Children" or "Child") to use the Site in any manner that could result in the Child submitting Personal Information.  For example, when a Parent authorizes their Child to use our messaging tools to communicate with another Site member, the Child could disclose their Personal Information to others. Thus, Parents authorize us to collect, store and distribute the Child’s Personal Information to Site members as expressly designated by the Parent.  Additionally, we may link certain information collected through a variety of technologies that automatically collect certain information whenever a Child interacts with the Site, as described in Section 3.  We may also share a Child’s information as set forth in Section 6.  Age of Learning, Inc. is the operator of this Site.  Questions regarding this Privacy Policy and issues related to your Children’s Personal Information should be directed to us via any of the following methods:

  * Mailing address: Age of Learning, Inc., PO Box 230, Glendale, CA 91209: Attention: General Counsel
  * Telephone number: **(818) 246-2223 (General Counsel)**
  * E-mail address: [support@abcmouse.com](mailto:support@abcmouse.com)



9\. Links to Other Sites.

Areas of the Site open to children will never have links to third party web sites. In the separately password-protected parents and teachers section of the Site we may include links to other websites that relate to the Site experience.  Linked websites are governed by their own privacy policies or information collection practices, which may be substantially different from ours.  We encourage you to review the privacy policies and information collection practices of those linked websites.

10\. Consent to Transfer Information to the United States.

The Site is operated in the United States.  If you are located in the European Union, Canada or anywhere else outside of the United States, the information we collect from you will be transferred to and processed in the United States. The U.S. data protection laws may differ from those of the country in which you are located, and your Personal Information may be subject to access requests from governments, courts, or law enforcement in the United States, according to laws of the United States.  When you use our Site or provide any information to us, you consent to the transfer, processing and storage of your information in the United States. 

11\. Security.

We incorporate commercially reasonable safeguards to help protect and secure your Personal Information. Please be aware that no data transmission or storage can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.  We cannot warrant the security of information you transmit to us, and you use our Site and provide us with your information at your own risk.

12\. Changes to Our Privacy Policy.

We may change this Privacy Policy at any time and such changes will come into effect when we post the revised Privacy Policy. We will not use Personal Information collected on this Site in a manner materially different than what was stated at the time it was collected without your consent.
