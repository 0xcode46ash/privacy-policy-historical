# ABCmouse.com

Welcome to ABCmouse.com®, which is owned and operated by Age of Learning, Inc. We are committed to providing children with a learning environment where every activity is just as fun as it is educational, and where you can feel confident that your children’s privacy is protected.

This Privacy Policy describes the ways in which Age of Learning, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively, “we,” “our,” or “us”) collect, use, and disclose information about you and the children who use your account through ABCmouse.com, and any other websites, applications and online services (“Apps”) that link to this policy (collectively, the “Services”). By using the Services, you agree to the handling of your information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

1. Child Safe Guarantee

The Services are backed by our Child Safe guarantee. This means that Accounts will never include any pop-up ads or other advertisements directed at children. In addition, Child Users are blocked from accessing external links, which will only be available if an Adult User enters his or her password.

2. Types of Accounts and Users

How we collect, use, and disclose information depends on the type of account and the type of user.

We currently offer the following types of accounts through the Services: Family Accounts, Teacher Accounts, Classroom-Linked Accounts, Librarian Accounts, Guest Library Accounts, Personal Library Accounts, Library Home Checkout Accounts and Community Center Accounts (collectively, “Accounts”), which are described in our [Terms & Conditions](https://web.archive.org/tandc).

Users of the Services include “Child Users” (children who use the learning portion of the Services) and “Adult Users” (including parents and guardians of Child Users, gift account purchasers, teachers, librarians, and community center administrators).

3. Content You Submit.

A. Information Users Provide to Us We and our third-party service providers collect any information that Adult and Child Users provide when using the Services, including when Adult Users create an account or contact us with a question, comment, or request, and when Child Users participate in learning activities. 

0 Adult Users Adult Users are asked to provide certain information about themselves when registering for any ABCmouse Account, including first and last name, email address, telephone number (which is optional), and physical address. The other information provided at registration depends on the type of Account or Adult User. For example: 

  * Payment card information is collected from Adult Users who purchase an Account, including those who purchase a gift account for others.
  * Parent or legal guardian email address is collected when the Adult User purchasing a Family Account or setting up a Personal Library Account or Library Home Checkout Account states that they are not the legal guardian, or if a teacher or community center administrator provides such addresses in order for parents or legal guardians to connect to the Teacher Account or Community Center Account.
  * School, library, or community center name and address are collected from Adult Users who register for a Teacher, Librarian, or Community Center Account.



Adult Users who register for a Family, Teacher, Classroom-Linked, Personal Library, Library Home Checkout, or Community Center Account are asked to provide the first name (or nickname) and gender, and may be asked for the birthdate, of Child Users who will be accessing the Services through their Account.

In addition, Adult Users can choose to provide us with information through a separate password-protected section of the Services that allows Adult Users to administer their accounts (“Parent Section” or “Teacher Dashboard”), accessible via the Menu or Settings link on the Services, including when they add Child Users, provide testimonials, seek customer support, or submit comments or questions.

If you submit any information relating to other people in connection with the Services, you represent that you have the authority to do so and to permit us to use the information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

1 Child Users Previously, on the Adobe Flash version of the Services, certain activities allowed Child Users to create or upload certain free-form content—such as photographs, audio or video files, and artwork—and save it on the Services. When we upgraded to the HTML 5 version of the Services, we removed some of these features so there is no longer the ability to upload photographs or audio or video files, although we may provide these services in the future. Children still have the ability to create free-form artwork. We encourage you to use the Services with your Child Users if you would like to monitor any content uploaded or created by them. If you would like to review all such content saved by your Child Users, you can access this content by clicking on the My Files menu item in each Child User’s About Me section of the Services. 

B. Information We Collect from Users We and our third-party service providers collect information directly from users of the Services in the form of the actions they take and activities they complete when using the Services. For example, from Adult Users, we may collect information about patterns of usage, order history, and participation in promotions or contests; from Child Users, we may collect information about patterns of usage, which activities a child commences and completes, when a child starts and stops an activity, which areas of the Services the child frequents, the number of questions answered correctly or incorrectly, how many tickets the child earns, what virtual items the child selects to exchange for tickets, and the child’s choice of avatar and customization. 

We and our third-party service providers also use a variety of technologies, such as cookies (small text files that the Services save on your computer or mobile device), to automatically collect certain technical information from your computer or mobile device over time and across different websites including when you use the Services, such as your browser type, operating system, device type, the page served, your IP address, and the websites you visited prior to visiting the Services. When you download and use one of our Apps, we and our service providers may track and collect App usage data, such as the date and time the App on your device accesses our servers and what information and files have been downloaded to the App based on your device number.

We and our third-party service providers may use the information collected through these technical methods for a number of purposes, including delivering content, tracking and enhancing our users’ experience on the Services, and delivering advertising to visitors of www.abcmouse.com when they visit other websites and applications. For example, when you return to the Services after logging in, cookies help the Services recognize who you are without having to log back in. For more information, see “How We Use This Information,” below. The information collected through these technical methods on the child-directed portions of the Services are used only to support the internal operations of the Services.

If you do not want the Services to collect information through the use of cookies, you can set your web browser to reject cookies from the Services. Each browser is different, so you should check your browser’s “Help” menu to learn how to change your cookie preferences. However, please note that if you reject or block cookies from the Services, the Services may not function as intended. For example, you will not be able to remain logged in to your Account and therefore would have to log in during each page transition.

4. How We Use Information

We and our third-party service providers may use the information collected from Adult and Child Users as follows:

A. Adult User Information Information collected from Adult Users may be used: 

  * To permit you to register and use the Services, including, for example, to send you communications about Child User progress or your Account, or to allow you to make use of social media sharing through the Parent Section.
  * To complete and fulfill your purchase, such as to process your payments, communicate with you regarding your purchase, and provide you with related customer service.
  * To respond to your inquiries and fulfill your requests, such as to send you newsletters, retrieve your password, or provide technical support.
  * To send you marketing communications that we believe may be of interest to you. While it is never our intention to send any marketing messages to children, if you believe a Child User may have received such a marketing communication, please contact us as described in Section 12 (“Contact Us”), below. You may always choose to stop receiving these marketing messages simply by following the instructions contained in the message. You may not opt out of receiving administrative messages from us regarding your Account.
  * To deliver interest-based advertising to you based on your visits to the non-child-directed portions of the Services (such as www.abcmouse.com), including ABCmouse-branded advertising, when you visit third-party websites and applications. We will never use information collected in the child-directed portions of the Services for targeted advertising purposes. We do not currently respond to web browser “do not track” signals, but you may opt out of receiving online interest-based advertising from our interest-based advertising providers by visiting http://www.aboutads.info/choices. For more information about web browser “do not track” signals, visit www.allaboutdnt.org.
  * To measure the effectiveness of our advertising to adults.
  * To allow you to participate in sweepstakes, contests, and similar promotions and to administer these activities. Some of these have rules that could contain additional details about how we use and disclose your information.



B. Child User Information Information collected from Child Users may be used: 

  * To measure a Child User’s performance in activities and to adapt a Child User’s learning experience to the Child User’s learning needs.
  * To analyze, provide progress reports on, or provide an assessment of a Child User’s performance.



Information collected from Child Users is never used to market to Child Users.

C. Both Adult and Child User Information Information collected from both Adult and Child Users may be used: 

  * To allow us to assess and improve the Services, its educational content, and other services we provide, for example, to improve our content and user experience; to research, evaluate, and improve the Services’ educational efficacy; and to inform our understanding of the Services’ user base.
  * To customize, adapt, and personalize users’ viewing and content-consumption experience, for example by measuring a Child User’s performance in activities and adapting the Child User’s learning path to his or her learning needs.
  * To maintain and analyze the functioning of the Services.
  * As we believe to be necessary or appropriate: (a) under applicable law, including laws outside your country of residence; (b) to comply with legal process; (c) to respond to requests from public and government authorities, including public and government authorities outside your country of residence; (d) to detect violations of and enforce our terms and conditions; (e) to protect our operations or those of any of our affiliates, including the security of the Services; (f) to protect our rights, privacy, safety, or property, or that of our affiliates, you, or others; and (g) to allow us to pursue available remedies or limit the damages that we may sustain.



Information collected from Child Users is never used to market to Child Users.

5. When We Disclose Information to Third Parties

Information collected from both Adult and Child Users may be disclosed as follows:

  * To third parties who perform certain services for us, such as to process credit cards, administer sweepstakes, or conduct or evaluate research (such as on the educational impact of the Services), provided that the service providers agree to keep the information confidential and to use it only for purposes that are permitted by this Privacy Policy.
  * The Services may occasionally hold “coloring contests” or similar activities where Child Users may create and submit artwork or other content. Upon submission, we will review this content and may publish it along with the Child User’s first name on a page that may be viewed by other ABCmouse users.
  * Where parents or legal guardians have linked a Family Account to a Teacher Account, as described in the Terms & Conditions, the Adult Users of both accounts will be able to review the progress and details of their Child Users within both accounts.
  * As we believe to be necessary or appropriate: (a) under applicable law, including laws outside your country of residence; (b) to comply with legal process; (c) to respond to requests from public and government authorities, including public and government authorities outside your country of residence; (d) to detect violations of and enforce our terms and conditions; (e) to protect our operations or those of any of our affiliates, including the security of the Services; (f) to protect our rights, privacy, safety, or property, or that of our affiliates, you, or others; and (g) to allow us to pursue available remedies or limit the damages that we may sustain.
  * Subject to confidentiality agreements, the terms of this Privacy Policy, and applicable law, to service providers, advisors, potential transactional partners, or other third parties in connection with the consideration, negotiation, or completion of a corporate transaction in which we are acquired by or merged with another company or we sell, liquidate, or transfer all or a portion of our assets in bankruptcy or otherwise. This means that if some or all of our assets are acquired or otherwise transferred, including in bankruptcy, that such acquirer shall be subject to the same commitments as stated under this Privacy Policy.



In addition, we may use third-party advertising networks to collect cookie information about Adult Users’ visits to the non-child-directed portions of the Services and to (1) deliver interest-based advertising to those Adult Users, including ABCmouse-branded advertising, when those Adult Users visit third-party websites, and (2) provide us with statistics about the effectiveness of our advertising on third-party websites. These third-party advertising networks may use this cookie information in accordance with their own privacy policies.

We do not disclose the personally identifiable information of any Child User to third parties for their marketing or promotional purposes. The only third party that collects information from Child Users through the Services is Soasta mPulse, who provides a platform as a service solution that allows us to collect information about our user’s experience. If you have any questions about Soasta’s privacy policies or use of Child Users’ information, please contact us as described in Section 12 (“Contact Us”) below.

We also may disclose de-identified and/or aggregated Adult or Child User information for any other purpose—for example, the distribution of de-identified user records to outside researchers or the distribution of reports containing aggregate user demographic and traffic patterns—provided that no individual Adult or Child User or any specific end user device can be readily identified.

6. How to Access, Change, or Delete Account Information

An Adult User can review or change the information they provided when registering for the Services, including by adding or removing Child Users to the Account, by updating information through the Parent Section of the Services or, for Teacher Accounts or Community Center Accounts, by using the Class Builder or Settings Feature in the Teacher Dashboard. In addition, at any time, Adult Users may contact us as described in Section 12 (“Contact Us”) below to request that we provide for their review, or delete from our records, any personally identifiable information they have provided about Child Users associated with their Account, or to cease collecting personally identifiable information from those Child Users, as applicable. Please keep in mind that a request to delete personally identifiable information may lead to cancelation of your Account, and if a Teacher Account or Community Center Account is linked to a Family Account, a request to delete personally identifiable information in one of the Accounts may be reflected in the other Account.

When we change or delete any personally identifiable information at your request, we will make good faith efforts to make the changes in our then active databases as soon as reasonably practicable. Changing setting options may not result in immediate changes to the settings, which are subject to our operations and maintenance schedules.

7. Account Cancelation and Reactivation; Data Deletion

At any time, Adult Users, with the exception of Library related Accounts, may cancel their Accounts through the Parent Section or Teacher Dashboard Section of the Services. Librarians and those with Personal Library Accounts or Library Home Checkout Accounts may contact us as described in Section 12 (“Contact Us”) below to cancel such Accounts.

For Family Accounts that have been canceled, and Personal Library Accounts and Library Home Checkout Accounts, if the account remains inactive for 24 months, we will delete all personally identifiable information associated with the Account (“Account Information”). The 24 months is provided so that you have the ability, following cancelation of a Family Account or inactivity, to reactivate your account and potentially recover previous information and resume where the Child User left off. However, we provide no guarantee, and shall have no liability or obligation to ensure, that all Account Information and Services related progress will be available or accessible or all learning or personalization features will be able to be recovered or resumed.

For Teacher Accounts and Community Center Accounts, if you cancel your Account, we will delete all Account Information 48 hours after the cancelation, unless a Child User’s parent or legal guardian has linked to the Account, in which case we will delete that Child User’s Account Information as described in the previous paragraph. Please note that canceling an entire Teacher Account or Community Center Account will result in the loss of activities and progress data for every Child User, except for Child Users whose parents or legal guardians have linked to the Account. If a Teacher Account or Community Center Account is not canceled, we will delete all Account Information 24 months after the last activity on the Account.

Upon Account cancelation, de-identified Adult and Child User information may nonetheless persist internally in our databases, and may still be used, on a de-identified basis, for our internal support, administrative, and recordkeeping purposes including, but not limited to, allowing us to improve the Services and other services we provide through research, evaluation, and analytics.

8. Links to Other Services

In certain sections of the Services, we may include links to external websites or applications (for example, Facebook and Twitter). However, in order to protect children from accessing these external websites, an Adult User will be required to enter a valid password. These websites and applications are governed by their own privacy policies or information collection practices, which may be substantially different from ours. We encourage you to review the privacy policies and information collection practices of those linked websites and apps, as those parties’ practices are not subject to this policy.

9. Location of Information Processing

The Services are controlled and operated by us from the United States. Your information may be stored and processed in any country where we have facilities or in which we engage service providers, including the United States, which may have data protection laws that are different from those of your country. In addition, your information may be subject to access requests from governments, courts, or law enforcement officials in countries where it may be processed, under the laws of those countries.

10. Security

The security of your personal information is important to us, and we employ physical, technical, and administrative security measures to safeguard the information collected by the Services. Please be aware, however, that no information system can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot guarantee the absolute security of your information. Moreover, we are not responsible for the security of information you transmit to the Services over networks that we do not control, including the Internet and wireless networks. If you have reason to believe that your interaction with us is not secure, please contact us as described in Section 12 (“Contact Us”) below.

11. Changes to Our Privacy Policy

If we update this Privacy Policy, we will notify you by posting the revised Privacy Policy on the Services, and for certain revisions that materially expand the ways in which we use or share the information previously collected from you through the Services either display an alert next to the Privacy Policy, display an alert upon log-in to the Services, or directly communicate with you (e.g., via the email address associated with your Account).
