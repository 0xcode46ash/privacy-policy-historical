Some of our websites enable members to register directly for courses and workshops that we offer and host ourselves. On those websites you will have to register with a valid telephone number as well.

We gather your personal information for the following purposes: 

  * In case of websites where we offer courses/workshops, personal information is used to send confirmation emails, course details and reminders. 
  * Sending out our newsletter. Members can decide for themselves if they want to receive our newsletter or not.
