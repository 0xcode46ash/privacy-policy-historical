Becoming a member is done by filling out a registration form and by submitting this form your details are stored in our member database. Becoming a member is free and voluntary. In this section we will outline how we collect personal information and how personal information is protected and used by us.

Some of our websites enable members to register directly for courses and workshops that we offer and host ourselves. On those websites you will have to register with a valid telephone number as well. This to ensure that we can reach you both by email and phone should there be cancellations or changes in the course/workshop program or details.

All personal information and account settings are stored in our database. Only certain ABC Group administrators have access to this database and this database is not made public or shared with third party companies. 

## What is personal information used for?

We gather your personal information for the following purposes: 

  * In case of websites where we offer courses/workshops, personal information is used to send confirmation emails, course details and reminders. 
  * Sending out our newsletter. Members can decide for themselves if they want to receive our newsletter or not. 
  * Personal Information is used in member profiles which are linked to possible article and/or comment submissions on our website. In this way visitors can see who submitted what.
  * We do not share our member database with third parties nor do we make email addresses or other contact information available through our website or otherwise. We do not send out unsolicited email.
