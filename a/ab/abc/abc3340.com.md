3\. Registration. To make use of certain features on the Website users may need to register and to provide certain information as part of the registration process.

5\. Cookies. To help make the Website more responsive to the needs of users, the Website employs a standard feature of browser software, called a "cookie," to assign each user a unique, random number that resides on a user's computer. The cookie does not personally identify the user; it merely identifies the computer with which the user accesses the Website. Unless a user voluntarily identifies himself or herself (through registration, for example), the Website will not be able to identify the identity of the user, even if a cookie is assigned to a user's computer. The only personal information a cookie can contain is information supplied by a user. The advertisers on the Website may also assign their own cookies to a user's browser, a process that TV Alabama, Inc. does not control. The Website uses cookies to help tailor the Website and deliver a more personalized service. Of course, users are free to instruct their web browsers not to accept cookies; however, doing so may render a computer unable to take advantage of the personalized features enjoyed by other users of the Website. 

6\. IP Addresses. The Website's servers automatically collect limited information about a user's computer's connection to the Internet, including a user's IP address. (The IP address is a number that lets computers attached to the Internet know where to send data - such as the web pages users view.) An IP address does not personally identify a user. The Website uses this information to deliver its content to users upon request, to tailor the Website to a user's interests, and to measure traffic within the Website. 

7\. Third Party Sites. The Website includes links to third party websites whose privacy policies TV Alabama, Inc. does not control. Once a user leaves the Website, use of any information a user provides is governed by the privacy policy of the operator of the site the user is visiting. The privacy policies of third party websites may differ from that of TV Alabama, Inc..

TV Alabama, Inc. does NOT knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of thirteen.

If TV Alabama, Inc. becomes aware that it has inadvertently received personally-identifiable information from a user under the age of thirteen, TV Alabama, Inc. will delete such information from its records. Because TV Alabama, Inc. does not collect any personally identifiable information from children under the age of thirteen, it also does NOT knowingly distribute such information to third parties.
