Privacy on the Internet has become a growing concern for both webmasters and web surfers. AbsoluteNow's policy is to respect and protect the privacy of our users. This page will allow you to see how we collect information from you and how we use it. When you register with our mailing list or send a suggestion or trivia answer to AbsoluteNow, you're personal information will be kept highly confidential. There are some instances where your name and message will be reproduced, but this will be done solely with your consent. There are also instances where certain emails will be used as examples on this [page](https://web.archive.org/web/20010604064930id_/http%3A//www.absolutenow.com/crazyletters.html), however personal information will not be used, and the option to have these mailings removed will be yours, and your desire will be immediately met.

We will not disclose your personal information to third parties without your consent. AbsoluteNow may disclose user information in special cases when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) AbsoluteNow's rights or property, other AbsoluteNow users, or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities. AbsoluteNow may disclose user information when we believe in good faith that the law requires it.

AbsoluteNow shares information about our users with advertisers, business partners, sponsors and other third parties. To see a list of the Third Parties we are currently working with, please go here. For example, we will say AbsoluteNow's audience is x percent female and y percent male. This data is used to customize AbsoluteNow content and advertising to deliver a better experience for our users. If you are interested in learning who are visitors are and where they come from, please see our [Media Kit](http://apps.flycast.com/webkit/main.cgi?2589712).

**UPDATE** : We have added a free postcard section for our users to send electronic postcards to friends. No one at AbsoluteNow will ever sell or use the information provided in these cards.

Here is a quick run down on some privacy issues at AbsoluteNow:

**Resale or disclosure of information to third parties:**

> No information you submit will ever be resold to anyone outside of AbsoluteNow. As specified above, this information will be delivered to our third party advertisers, but will never be sold directly. This means, for example, you will never receive spam as a result of your visit or contribution to AbsoluteNow. 

**Browser information collected on the website:**

> AbsoluteNow analyzes our website logs to constantly improve the value of the materials available on website. They in no way personally identify or specify you as a user, but are used for general information. An example of this is that AbsoluteNow will look to see where users come from \- say 45% of users come from Yahoo!, 24% from Altavista, etc. and so on.

**Use of Cookies:**

> No cookies are used on AbsoluteNow in anyway.
> 
> If you are intested in learning what cookies are, you can visit [Cookie Central](http://www.cookiecentral.com/).

**Privacy of Our Email List:**

> AbsoluteNow uses [Listbot](http://www.listbot.com/) to manage our mailing list. AbsoluteNow specifically uses no information submitted for anything other than knowing where our members are located. An example here, is that our webmaster, Jeremy Falcone, will often look at the demographics, simply to know what new things to add. For instance, if a substantial amount of visitors come from the Southwest, it would be of use to both our members and AbsoluteNow to increase the number of Salsa/Latin Music options on the site.
> 
> Listbot, however, does use cookies, and if you are interested in how Listbot uses the information you submit, you should visit their site.

**PGP encrypted email:**

> At this point in time, no correspondce to AbsoluteNow is encrypted, nor is there truly any need for such. If the need ever arises, rest assured that we will definitely have this possibility. 
> 
> As far as secure pages, there are no current pages on AbsoluteNow that are secure, as there has been no need to do so up to this point. If this need changes, we will certainly update and allow for some pages or sections to be viewed securely.
> 
> No pages are password protected, except for administration pages within the site. This is likely to change in the future, however, when AbsoluteNow offers it's mailing list members exclusive looks at certain parts of the site, which will require password protection. However, at this time, no pages are password protected. UPDATE: As of April 20, 2000 - http://www.absolutenow.com/members/ will be password protected, so as to allow members of AbsoluteNow an exclusive look at the site.

**Children's Security :**

> In compliance with the latest FTC law regulating the security of children on the Internet, which states that a website should: 
>
>> \+ provide parents notice of their information practices;   
>  \+ obtain verifiable parental consent before collecting a child's personal information, with certain limited exceptions;   
>  \+ give parents a choice as to whether their child's information will be disclosed to third parties;   
>  \+ provide parents access to their child's personal information and allow them to review it and/or have it deleted;   
>  \+ give parents the opportunity to prevent further use or collection of information;   
>  not require a child to provide more information than is reasonably necessary to participate in an activity; and   
>  \+ maintain the confidentiality, security, and integrity of information collected from children.
> 
> AbsoluteNow has very few sections of the site which ask for personal information. The only section that asks for anything, is joining the Mailing List. I have modified the questions asked in joining the mailing list in order to comply with the above. The only required things are
> 
>   * an email address
>   * a name (first/last)
>   * age
>   * gender
