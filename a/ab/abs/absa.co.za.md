# Absa | Privacy Policy

**Absa collects and processes your information in order to give you the product and/or service that you want and it takes seriously its responsibility to safeguard your privacy.  **

Absa will only collect and process the personal information it needs in order to provide products and/or services to you, or to enable it to comply with the requirements of specific laws that it is governed by.

Absa may also process your personal information in order to protect your or its legitimate interests. Absa will not collect and process personal information about you that it does not need for this purpose. The general purpose for which it collects and processes your personal information includes, but is not limited to:

Creating a record of you on its system in order to verify your identity, provide you with the products and/or services you have applied for, and then communicate with and keep you informed about these products and/or services;

  * Assessing whether you qualify for the granting of credit, or the increasing of your credit limit;
  * Identifying you and verifying your physical address, source of income and similar information;
  * Providing income tax-related information to tax authorities; and
  * Assessing your personal financial circumstances and needs before providing advice to you.  




Furthermore, Absa will not process your special personal information unless:

  * You have consented to Absa processing it;
  * It is necessary to exercise or defend a right or obligation in law; 
  * It is necessary to comply with an international legal obligation of public interest;
  * It is for certain historical, research or statistical purposes that would not adversely affect your privacy; or
  * You have deliberately made the information public yourself.  




There are some personal information fields that you have to fill in if you want Absa to provide you with your chosen product and/or service. This information can be provided in writing, electronically or telephonically, but it must be accurate and complete. These fields are indicated by an asterisk on the respective forms/websites. If Absa does not receive the necessary personal information, it will not be able to continue with your application. If you are already a client and Absa asks you for this information and you do not provide it, Absa will have to suspend the provision of the product and/or services for a period of time, or even terminate its relationship with you.

In most cases, personal information will be collected directly from you, but there may be other instances when Absa will collect personal information from other sources. These may include: public records; places where you may already have made your personal information public (for example, on social media), credit bureaus, or individuals/directors whom you have appointed as your representative.

Absa will, in most instances, collect and process your personal information internally. However, there are times when Absa needs to outsource these functions to third parties, either within Absa or external to Absa, including parties in other countries. Absa may also need to share your data with credit bureaus or other regulatory or industry bodies, so that it can meet its due diligence or regulatory requirements. When Absa decides to transfer your personal information to other parties, it will only provide it to companies that have the same data privacy policies as Absa or are subject to laws relating to the processing of personal information that are similar to those that apply to Absa.

There may be instances where Absa will process your personal information through a secured automated tool, or performing profiling resulting in a decision that may affect you significantly. If you are unhappy about the outcome of such a decision, please contact your local customer service centre.
