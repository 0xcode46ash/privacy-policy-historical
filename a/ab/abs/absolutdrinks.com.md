  **2.  How and why do we use tracking technologies?**

TAC uses tracking technologies such as cookies, IP Address or Log files, to gather certain information such as browser type and operating system, referring page, path through site, domain of ISP etc. for the purpose of improving the use and functionality of our websites and to better understand how visitors use our Digital Media and the tools and services offered on it. Tracking technologies help us tailor our Digital Media to your personal needs.

  * We use Cookies to better understand how visitors use our Digital Media and the tools and services offered, and improve their use and functionality. Subject to your consent where required by applicable law, our Digital Media use cookies and similar technologies (“ **cookies** ”).

These entries are generated anonymously, and help us gather (among other things) (i) a user’s browser type and operating system, (ii) information about a user’s session (such as the URL they came from, the date and time they visited our Digital Media, and which pages they've viewed on our Digital Media and for how long), and, (iii) other similar navigational or click-stream data. We also use information captured in log file for our internal marketing and demographic studies, so we can constantly improve and customize the online services we provide you. Log files are used internally only, and are not associated with any particular user.



  **3.  For what purpose do we use your Personal Data?**

All Personal Data collected is used for the purposes for which you submitted the information to us and/or as otherwise identified at the collection point or in this Privacy Policy.

These purposes are mainly the following:

  * **To respond to your request of service or for the performance of a contract**
    * When registering or signing-up in our Digital Media to provide you the service you subscribe to: the Personal Data you provide is used to offer you the benefits and privileges that typically come along with your registration, such as the ability to receive the communications you select at the time of registration (e.g. subscription to a newsletter, creation of an account, participation in a sweepstake or contest, invitation to or attendance to an event organized by TAC);
    * When doing e-commerce on certain of our websites: we use your Personal Data to manage your order and deliver your products in accordance with the e-commerce contract entered into with TAC. We can also implement technical solutions to detect fraudulent payment and secure the payment of your purchases on our websites. Implementation of such solutions may lead to profiling based on automated decision making which are subject to additional safeguards to protect your rights as further described in Article 9 of this Privacy Policy.
    * Feedback, questions, or comments through our “Contact Us” form and our “Tell Us” compliance reporting system: if you contact us via an online contact form, your Personal Data is used to respond to your inquiry or comment.
    * We may also use your email address to send you transactional or administrative communications (e.g., confirmation email when you sign up for, or unsubscribe from, a specific registration or activity), as well as certain service-related announcements (e.g., notices about updates to our privacy notices, discontinued features or programs on our Digital Media, changes to our online services or technical support policies, or other related changes.
  * **To allow us to send you marketing information on TAC or its products provided you consented thereto:**
    * When you use the Send to a friend feature: Personal Data requested for a one time use feature (typically, names and email addresses) is used on a one-time basis (e.g., to send the communication) and is not further retained by us;
    * In addition to the purpose for which you submitted your Personal Data, you may also be given the option (through a check box or otherwise) to have your Personal Data used for an activity or service different from the primary activity or service that you are requesting. For example, if you are signing up for a contest or other promotion, you may also be invited to sign up for newsletters or alerts from our Digital Media hosting the promotion or from other websites. If you choose to receive these additional services, we will use your Personal Data to provide them to you.
    * When you use a QR Code or equivalent feature displayed on TAC products: we use your Personal Data to send you more information on the products where the QR code or equivalent feature is displayed or other products;
    * When you accept our cookies in the conditions described in [the Cookies Policy](https://web.archive.org/en/legal/cookies-policy/);
    * When you provide Personal Data requested on the mobile devices such as iPads available in Heritage Centers, distilleries, we use it to send you more information on the products;
    * Subject to your consent when required, we may occasionally combine, update, or otherwise enhance the Personal Data collected through our Digital Media with data we receive from outside records or third parties. For instance, we may combine purely demographic or survey information (e.g., age, gender, household information, and other interests, etc.) not linked to any Personal Data about you with Personal Data collected though our offers (such as during account registration).



We may use the combined information above mentioned and/or demographic information for our internal marketing and demographic studies and to constantly improve, personalize, and customize the products and services we provide you to better meet your needs. Some of the tools we use may involve automated individual decision-making. In such case, you will be informed about the conditions of profiling and entitled to rely on additional safeguards to protect your rights as further described in Article 9 of this Privacy Policy.

  * **Because it is also TAC’s legitimate interest to better serve you**
    * We will ensure that your Personal Data remains accurate and up to date and avoid duplication in our database, by checking upon each of your interaction with us and/or one of our affiliates whether your Personal Data is still accurate or need to be completed or updated with the additional information you will have provided.
    * We may conduct profiling based on a monitoring of your browsing activities on our Digital Media to better understand your preferences and center of interests and adapt our marketing communications to your profile, unless you object in the conditions set forth in Article 9 of this Privacy Policy. 



**4.  What happens if you do not wish to provide your Personal Data?**

If you choose not to submit any Personal Data when requested, you may not be able to participate in certain activities and personalized features and it may happen that our Digital Media limit the services and special offers we can provide you. For example, if you refuse to share your email address, you will not be able to receive our newsletters or otherwise register on our Digital Media. However, to simply browse our Digital Media and learn more about TAC and our products, you do not need to give us any Personal Data. In any event, we will always inform you of the Personal Data that are necessary in order to benefit from a service.

**5.  Who do we disclose your Personal Data to and why?**

TAC will never share your Personal Data with any third party that intends to use it for direct marketing purposes unless we have specifically informed you beforehand and you have given us specific permission to do this.

TAC may share for the purposes mentioned in Article 3 your Personal Data with its subsidiary companies, parent companies, companies in which TAC’s ultimate parent company Pernod Ricard S.A. has control through either direct or indirect ownership (collectively  _“_ Pernod Ricard Group”) notably, in the following circumstance: the information we collect as described in this Privacy Policy may come from the entity to which you provide it but may also be made available, subject to your consent, through such entity to other entities of the Pernod Ricard Group to provide you with news and promotional information about their products or programs you have shown interest in.

If you wish to withdraw your consent to such sharing and use of your information, please address your request as indicated in Article 9 of this Privacy Policy, with your name, client reference and your withdrawal that we share your Information with all or part of the entities of the Pernod Ricard Group (indicating the list of entities concerned), and to receive marketing information from them.

TAC may also share your Personal Data with third parties, but only in the following circumstances:

  * We may use service providers, agents or contractors to provide support for the internal operations of our Digital Media and to assist us with administering them or the various functions, programs and promotions available on it.

  * When we run a joint or co-sponsored program or promotion on our Digital Media with another company, organization, or other reputable third party; and, as part of this event, collect and process Personal Data, we may share your Personal Data with our partner or sponsor, subject to your consent when required. If your Personal Data is being collected by (or is shared with) a company other than TAC as part of such promotion, we will let you know this at the time your Personal Data is collected;



When running any promotion involving another company, we will, if applicable, provide a separate link to that company's privacy policy and we encourage you to read it before you share any Personal Data, as we cannot guarantee they adhere to the same privacy practices. If you do not want your Personal Data to be collected by or shared with a company other than ours, you can always choose not to opt in or participate in these events at the time the Personal Data is collected/requested;

  * We may also disclose your Personal Data if we are required to do so by law, or if in our good faith judgment, such action is reasonably necessary to comply with legal processes, to respond to any claims, or to protect the safety or rights of TAC, its customers, or the public;
  * In the event of a merger or acquisition of all or part of TAC by another company, or in the event that TAC were to sell or dispose of all or a part of the TAC business, the acquirer would have access to the information maintained by that TAC business, which could include Personal Data, subject to applicable law. Similarly, Personal Data may be transferred as part of a corporate reorganization, insolvency proceeding, or other similar event, if permitted by and done in accordance with applicable law;
  * We may share aggregated demographic or survey Personal Data with third parties, but this data is in anonymous form which does not allow re-identification. The aggregate data that we share may include anonymous data that is captured through the use of cookies and other similar tracking technology, as explained in Article 2.
