# Absolute Software - Privacy Policy

Absolute is committed to respecting and protecting your privacy and wants you to feel secure when visiting our Website and providing personal information to us. This Privacy Policy applies to Absolute and was created to inform you of the policies surrounding collection and use of your personal information.  This Privacy Policy is based on the Federal Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (“ _ **PIPEDA**_ ”) and the British Columbia Personal Information Protection act (the “Act”).  This document applies to Absolute customers who are not corporate or commercial entities.

Unless otherwise agreed to in writing by Absolute, by using this Website you are consenting to the terms and conditions set forth in this Privacy Policy, including without limitation, the collection, use and disclosure of your personal information by Absolute as outlined below.  IF YOU ARE NOT IN AGREEMENT WITH THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY, DO NOT SUBMIT ANY OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION.

Absolute may update this Privacy Policy from time to time without notice to you, therefore it is your responsibility to periodically review this Website for the most current version.  In the event this Privacy Policy is updated, your continued use of this Website and any subsequent submission of personal information by you will be deemed your conclusive acceptance of the updated Privacy Policy.

Absolute’s products and services help keep assets safe and secure and our products are designed to help protect your privacy.  Using a very small and stealthy software agent, our products allow your computer to call into our confidential and secure monitoring center on a regular basis.  The information that is gathered for theft recovery purposes includes the make, model, hardware serial numbers and IP address.  With your consent and participation, certain of our products may also collect additional asset-related information for certain other purposes designated by you, such as hardware/software inventory, lease management, PC migration and software license compliance.

Absolute’s products do NOT monitor your activities on the computer beyond the limited consensual information reporting function described above.  The agent is inactive until its next scheduled call.  Only if the computer is reported as stolen by you is any further action taken based on information gathered, with your prior written consent.

  


##### Accountability and Responsibility

Absolute is accountable for the protection of all personal information under our control.  The responsibility of ensuring compliance with policies and practices set forth in this Privacy Policy has been assigned to a “Privacy Officer”.  All questions, access to personal information, and complaints may be directed as follows:   Privacy Officer Absolute Software Corporation Suite 1600, Four Bentall Centre 1055 Dunsmuir Street Vancouver B.C. V7X 1K8 Tel: 604.730.9851 Fax: 604.730.2621 E-mail: privacy@absolute.com  

In the event the Privacy Officer is unable to address your concerns, the issue may be escalated to the office of the CEO.  At any point, you may also contact the BC Privacy Commissioner.  

  


##### Electronic Personal Information

Absolute takes all reasonable precautions to ensure that appropriate security measures are used when transferring personal information.  We operate secure data networks protected by firewalls meeting industry standards and we use password protection systems to ensure personal information is kept safe from loss, unauthorized access, modification or disclosure.  However, when using email or wireless communication, Absolute advises you that confidentiality and security over the Internet is not completely secure.

Absolute may use cookies to enable you to more easily sign in to our website.  “Cookies” are small data files created by a web server that recognize repeat visitors to a website.  Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer.

Absolute may monitor Website usage and traffic patterns in order to optimize our Website design and content.

Absolute’s website may contain links to third party sites and we recommend and encourage you to read the privacy policies posted on the third party sites.  Absolute is not responsible for the privacy policies of any third party.  

  


##### Identification and Collection of Personal Information

Absolute will only collect personal information for the following reasons; to develop, manage and deliver our products and services to our customers; to contact our customers directly about products and services that may be of interest; to ensure high standards of service to customers; to contact customers with product and service updates, upgrades and enhancements; to meet regulatory requirements; or to verify a customer’s identity.

Absolute will try to collect personal information directly from the individual concerned unless authorized by that individual to collect it from a third party or otherwise as permitted by law.  We will only collect personal information through lawful methods and we will not collect information indiscriminately.  

  


##### Consent

Absolute will obtain your consent first before collection, use or disclosure of your personal information, except where detailed in this Privacy Policy.  We will make reasonable efforts to ensure you understand how your personal information may be used or disclosed.  Your consent may be provided to Absolute orally, in writing or electronically, either personally or through an authorized individual.  You may withdraw or refuse to provide your consent to Absolute by giving reasonable notice.  Any such withdrawal or refusal of consent may prevent Absolute from providing service to you.  

  


##### Use, Disclosure and Retention

Absolute will only use or disclose personal information for the purposes for which it was collected.  In the event that your personal information is to be used or disclosed for another purpose, we will obtain your consent for that new purpose.

We may disclose your personal information without your consent under the following circumstances:  

a.) To a public authority or agent of a public authority, if in our reasonable judgement, it appears that there is imminent danger to the life, health or security of an individual which could be avoided or minimized by disclosure of the information;

b.) When such use or disclosure is clearly in the interests of the individual and consent cannot be obtained in a timely way;

c.) When such use or disclosure is required by or an anticipated breech of law;

d.) When it is reasonable to expect that the use or disclosure with the consent of the individual would compromise the availability or the accuracy of the personal information and the collection, use or disclosure is reasonable for an investigation or a proceeding; and

e.) When the information is publicly available.

Absolute will retain your personal information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected, or as required for legal or business purposes.  Any personal information you provided to us shall be destroyed, deleted or made anonymous once your account has been inactive for two years.    

  


##### Accuracy of Personal Information

Absolute will make reasonable efforts to ensure that personal information in our control is accurate, complete and current.  At any time, an individual may request an update of their personal information.  

  


##### Safeguarding Personal Information

Absolute will ensure that all personal information under our control is properly safeguarded against unauthorized access, use, disclosure, duplication or modification. We use security safeguards that are appropriate to the sensitivity of the personal information, which may include physical security (in offices and data centers) and electronic security measures such as access control systems, passwords and encryption software.  We will take appropriate security measures when disposing of any personal information.

  


##### Access to Personal Information

You have the right to access your personal information.  Upon written request (which could include fax or email) and with reasonable notice to Absolute, you will be provided access to your personal information within thirty (30) days of such a request, and we will inform you about what personal information we have in our control, how it is used and list any individuals or organizations to whom your personal information has been disclosed (if applicable).  In the event that Absolute cannot provide a copy of your personal information, you will be provided with a response in writing that documents the reason for refusal and relevant provision of the appropriate Act on which we rely and the remedies available to you.

If you request a change to your personal information, you will be required to provide personal information to identify yourself to Absolute.
