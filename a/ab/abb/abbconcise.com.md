### Use of Cookies

The **ABB** OPTICAL GROUP website uses "cookies" to help you personalize your online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a Web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.

One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you personalize **ABB** OPTICAL GROUP pages, or register with **ABB** OPTICAL GROUP site or services, a cookie helps **ABB** OPTICAL GROUP to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of recording your personal information, such as billing addresses, shipping addresses, and so on. When you return to the same **ABB** OPTICAL GROUP website, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the **ABB** OPTICAL GROUP features that you customized.

You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of the **ABB** OPTICAL GROUP services or websites you visit.

### Security of your Personal Information

**ABB** OPTICAL GROUP secures your personal information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. **ABB** OPTICAL GROUP secures the PII you provide on computer servers in a controlled, secure environment, protected from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. When personal information (such as a credit card number) is transmitted to other websites, it is protected through the use of encryption, such as Transport Layer Security (TLS 1.2) protocol.

### Credit Card Payment and Payment Information

YourLens.com does not capture or store your credit card information. The transactional ordering process utilizes a payment gateway (CyberSource) wherein Secure Acceptance accepts payments from the web and mobile browsers without payment data entering the Yourlens.com system. Payments are accepted using Point-to-Point Encryption (P2PE) and Payment Tokenization thus avoiding the storing of payment data. Payment Authorization Tokens are held until Payment Settlement.

### Password Policy

We protect your password information using technical and administrative security measures to reduce the risks of loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure and alteration of passwords. Some of the safeguards we use are strong password validation, temporary password reset procedures, and encryption of passwords when stored.

Passwords must be a minimum of 8 characters in length, contain a mix of upper case, lower case, at least one numeric and at least one special character.

If more than six failed login attempts are made to an account, a password lockout threshold is reached and the account will be locked for twenty (20) minutes. After twenty (20) minutes the account is reset and the failed attempts are cleared. During the lockout period you will NOT be able to login or reset your password.

Password reset requires user account validation wherein an email is sent, to the email address on file, with a temporary password. The temporary password is valid for a set period of time during which a user must login to their account and reset their password.

### User Password Management:

  * Users should never share their passwords with anyone else
  * Users should never share their passwords with any outside parties, including those claiming to be representatives of a business with a legitimate need to access user information
  * Users should take steps to avoid phishing scams and other attempts by hackers to steal passwords and other sensitive information
  * Users must refrain from writing passwords down and keeping them accessible
  * Users should not use password managers or other tools to help store and remember passwords

**ABB** OPTICAL GROUP will occasionally update this Statement of Privacy to reflect company and customer feedback. **ABB** OPTICAL GROUP encourages you to periodically review this Statement to be informed of how **ABB** OPTICAL GROUP is protecting your information.
