We only share your Personal Information with third parties as described below. We do not sell or rent Personal Information to third parties for their own marketing purposes.  


### Third-Party Advertising and Online Behavioral Advertising

You may be provided with online advertisements of AbbVie products and services on third-party websites and mobile services that are tailored to you, for example, on the basis of information that you provide to AbbVie or a third-party website you are visiting, or of your browsing activity, purchases, or interests. These types of tailored online advertisements may come through several sources, such as the following:

We may share with our advertising service providers your non-identifying information that we have obtained from cookies and other tracking technologies on our AbbVie Services.

Some AbbVie Services participate in online behavioral advertising (this is also sometimes called re-target advertising or interest-based advertising). You can identify these sites by the “Advertising Choices” link in the footer. Our advertising network partners may place and use cookies on AbbVie websites and on other third-party sites to collect information about your activities in order to provide you with online advertisements that are based on your interests. When an AbbVie online behavioral advertisement is delivered to you, you will see an “Ad Choices” icon. Clicking on the icon or link will take you to a Web site where you can manage or opt out of the use of data about your browsing history that is used for the delivery of online behavioral advertisements. If you opt out, you may still see advertisements online, including advertisements from AbbVie that are based on other information (e.g., based on the content of the page being viewed rather than your prior clickstream activity). In some cases, data may still be collected about your browsing activity by these third-party advertisers, but they will not use this data to deliver advertisements that are based on your past online browsing behavior. You can also opt out now by clicking here.

Some Web browsers may transmit “do-not-track” signals to Web  
Services with which the browser communicates. As of the Effective Date of this Privacy Notice, an industry standard has not yet been established on how to respond to these signals. Therefore, AbbVie does not currently respond to these signals. As discussed above, you can opt-out from advertisers that use your browsing history to deliver online behavioral advertisements by visiting adchoices.

### Affiliates, Vendors and Suppliers

We have relationships with various vendors and suppliers, including our affiliated companies, who help us operate our business and for whom it may be necessary to have access to your Personal Information in the course of providing services to AbbVie. We will not authorize these parties to use your Personal Information for any purpose that is not related to AbbVie’s business operation, and we require them to handle your Personal Information collected through the AbbVie Services in accordance with appropriate contractual privacy and security provisions and this Privacy Notice.

### Co-branded Services

We may partner with other companies to provide you with content or services on a joint or “co-branded” basis. At a co‑branded site, you will see both the AbbVie logo and the logo of the co-branding partner displayed on your screen. To access the services available on a co-branded site, you may have to complete a new online registration form, and this registration information may be shared with AbbVie’s co-branding partners. You should read the individual privacy policies of our co-branding partners, as they may differ in some respects from ours. Reading these policies will help you to make an informed decision about whether to provide your information to a given site.

### Product Reports

If you contact AbbVie regarding your experience in using one of our products, we may use the information that you provide in submitting reports to the US Food and Drug Administration and as otherwise required of us by law. We also may use the information to contact the prescribing physician to follow up regarding an unexpected event involving the use of our product.

### Legal Rights and Obligations

In certain limited circumstances, AbbVie may need to disclose your Personal Information in order to comply with a legal obligation or demand, such as to comply with reporting obligations to our governing regulatory authorities regarding the safety of our pharmaceutical products, or in connection with the sale or transfer of one of our product lines or divisions, which includes the services provided through one or more of the AbbVie Services. In such instances, we will take measures to protect your Personal Information to the extent possible.

### Links to Third Party Sites and Social Media Plug-ins

This Privacy Notice does not apply to AbbVie Services that do not link to this Privacy Notice, or to third-party Web sites to which AbbVie Services may link. AbbVie Services may use social media plug-ins (e.g., the Facebook “Like” button, “Share to Twitter” button) to enable you to easily share information with others. When you visit AbbVie Services, the operator of the social plug-in can place a cookie on your computer or other electronic device that enables that operator to recognize individuals who have previously visited our Site. If you are logged into the social media Web site (e.g., Facebook, Twitter) while browsing on our AbbVie Site, the social media plug-in allows that social media Web site to receive information that you have visited our AbbVie Site. The social media plug-in also allows the social media Web site to share information about your activities on our AbbVie Site with other users of their social media Web site. These sharing settings are managed by the social media Web site and governed by its privacy policy.
