# Privacy Policy | AbbVie

Our AbbVie Online Privacy Policy has changed, effective May 8, 2015. Because we care about your privacy, please take the time to read our updated policy. Your continued use of the site means you consent to our data collection, use, disclosure and storage practices.   
---  
  
We know that you may have concerns about sharing your information with us. AbbVie Inc. (“AbbVie”) is committed to respecting your privacy. This Online Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy”) will address your concerns about sharing your information with us by explaining how we handle the personal information provided to us on Websites controlled by AbbVie in the United States of America that link to this Privacy Policy (“AbbVie Web sites”).

This Privacy Policy does not apply to personal information collected from you offline, to AbbVie Web sites that do not link to this Privacy Policy, or to third-party Web sites to which AbbVie Web sites may link. Your use of AbbVie Web sites that link to this Privacy Policy is subject to this Privacy Policy and the [Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/termsofuse.html).

Please read this Privacy Policy before using AbbVie Web sites or submitting information to us. This Privacy Policy is designed to help you better understand how AbbVie uses and shares your information and protects your privacy when you use AbbVie Web sites.

## TYPES OF INFORMATION WE COLLECT ONLINE

The types of personal information that we may collect while you use the AbbVie Web sites are described in this section. Only some of these categories of information identify you directly, but each category offers some information about your interests and activities that could be used to make inferences about you.  


##### Information You Voluntarily Provide

Some of the information that we may obtain will only be collected if you voluntarily provide it to us, such as information provided during registration for a product or service, in response to questionnaires, or during other interactions with us.  


**Personal Identifying Information You Submit During Registration or in Response to Questionnaires**

AbbVie collects Personal Identifying Information that you voluntarily provide on AbbVie Web sites, for example, in order to register for AbbVie programs and services, register to receive marketing products and information, contact AbbVie customer service, or respond to AbbVie questionnaires or surveys. “Personal Identifying Information” means information that identifies you or that could reasonably be used to identify you. Examples of Personal Identifying Information include name, address, telephone number, and email address. When this information is combined with any information on health or medical status, we refer to the resulting information as “health-related information.”

If you choose to register for a program or service or to participate in our interactive services such as questionnaires and surveys, you may disclose health-related information as well as personal facts that could be used to identify you. To protect your privacy, you should not provide AbbVie with any information that is not specifically requested.  


**Personal Identifying Information You Submit During Other Interactions with AbbVie**

You may contact AbbVie to ask questions, discuss your concerns, or report problems regarding our products. If you communicate with or request information from AbbVie personnel, they will have your email address as well as whatever health-related and/or personal facts that you choose to include in your communication.

If you are reporting a product experience, we may ask you for specific facts, including patient initials, age, gender, and prescribing physician. US regulations require us to collect this information in order to file reports with the US Food and Drug Administration regarding the safety of our products.  


##### Information That May Be Collected by AbbVie Site Technology  


Other types of personal information will be automatically collected by us through our Web site technology.

**IP Address**

We may record the Internet Protocol (“IP”) address of your computer when you visit our site. An IP address identifies your computer, which allows us to maintain communication with your computer as you move about AbbVie Web sites.

**Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies**

We also collect nonidentifying information about your use of AbbVie Web sites through technology such as cookies and Web beacons. A “cookie” is a unique numeric code that is transferred to your computer to track your interests and preferences and to recognize you as a return visitor. A “Web beacon” is a transparent graphic image placed on a Web site that enables the monitoring of things such as user activity and site traffic. These technologies help remember your preferences on a site and allow us to bring you the content and features that are likely to be of greatest interest to you, on the basis of your previous activities on our Web sites. They also allow us to collect “clickstream” data, which is not Personal Identifying Information, but which reflects activities on AbbVie Web sites, including your interest in certain healthcare conditions or AbbVie services or products. To learn more about cookies and other tracking technologies, please visit http://www.allaboutcookies.org/.  


## HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION  


We may combine information about you from a visit to one AbbVie Web site with information about you from visits to other AbbVie Web sites. We may also combine information about you that is collected online with information that we have collected offline, as well as with information provided to us by third parties. We may use this information for the following purposes.  


**Marketing, Programs, and Services**

You do not have to register for a service or a program to use most of the information available on AbbVie Web sites. If you choose to register, we may use the Personal Identifying Information that you provide through AbbVie Web sites to respond to your questions and to provide you with efficient customer service. We may also use your Personal Identifying Information for other business purposes, such as to offer you the opportunity to receive notices regarding AbbVie’s products or services, to invite you to participate in surveys about our products, or to notify you about special promotions.

**Customized User Experiences**

The Personal Identifying Information that you provide may be used to create customized offers, information, or services tailored to your interests and preferences. Also, we may use your IP address and the nonidentifying data that we obtain through the use of cookies to make our sites easier to use and navigate as well as to personalize the content provided on AbbVie Web sites by anticipating the information and services that may be of interest to you.

**Product Improvement**  


If you choose to participate in our interactive services such as questionnaires or surveys or to register for an AbbVie program or service, we will collect the information that you disclose and analyze the data to discover new facts that could help us better understand our products. We may use this information for our internal business purposes, such as research to improve our products and analyses that may help us better market our products.

**Service and Web Site Improvement**

We may use the information about your use of the services and activities on AbbVie Web sites to monitor user traffic patterns and to try to analyze what our users prefer, so that we can design better services. We may analyze the information that is collected with cookie and other tracking technology to help us improve the function of AbbVie Web sites and to modify the services and information that we provide.  


## HOW WE SHARE YOUR INFORMATION WITH THIRD PARTIES

We may use third parties to provide services and information on our sites and to assist with online marketing and advertising, and we may provide some cobranded services in partnership with others. We also may use third parties to analyze data collected on AbbVie Web sites. If we allow a third party to have access to your Personal Identifying Information, we will not authorize them to use it for any purpose that is not consistent with this Privacy Policy. Additionally, AbbVie may share your Personal Identifying Information with a third party in connection with the sale or transfer of one of its product lines or divisions, so that the buyer can continue to provide you with information and services. Except as otherwise explained in this Privacy Policy, we will not sell or disclose any Personal Identifying Information that you provide on AbbVie Web sites to an unrelated third party without your express permission.  


_Third-Party Web Site Advertising and Online Behavioral Advertising; Ad Choices Opt-Out_

You may be provided with online advertisements on third-party Web sites that are tailored to you, for example, on the basis of information that is provided by you but that does not identify you (nonidentifying information),or of your Web browsing activity, purchases, or interests. These types of tailored online advertisements may come through several sources, such as the following:

  * We may share with our advertising companies your nonidentifying information, including nonidentifying personal information and other data that we have obtained from cookies and other tracking technologies.
  * We may use online behavioral advertising practices (this is also sometimes called retarget advertising or interest-based advertising). Our advertising network partners may place and use cookies on AbbVie Web sites and on other third-party Web sites to collect information about your activities in order to provide you with online advertisements that are based on your interests.



  
When an AbbVie online behavioral advertisement is delivered to you, you will see an “Ad Choices” icon. Clicking on the icon will take you to a Web site where you can manage or opt out of the use of data about your browsing history that is used for the delivery of online behavioral advertisements. If you opt out, you may still see advertisements online, including advertisements from AbbVie that are based on other information (e.g., based on the content of the page being viewed). In some cases, data may still be collected about your browsing activity by these third-party advertisers, but they will not use this data to deliver advertisements that are based on your past online browsing behavior. 

**Vendors and Suppliers**

We have relationships with various vendors and suppliers who help us operate our business. We will not authorize our vendors and suppliers to use your information for any purpose that is not related to AbbVie’s business operation.

**Co-branded Sites**

We may partner with other companies to provide you with content or services on a joint or “co-branded” basis. At a co branded site, you will see both the AbbVie logo and the logo of the co-branding partner displayed on your screen. To access the services available on a co-branded site, you may have to complete a new online registration form, and this registration information may be shared with AbbVie’s co-branding partners. You should read the individual privacy policies of our co-branding partners, as they may differ in some respects from ours. Reading these policies will help you to make an informed decision about whether to provide your information to a given site. 

**Social Media Plug-ins**

AbbVie Web sites may use social media plug-ins (e.g., the Facebook “Like” button, “Share to Twitter” button) to enable you to easily share information with others. When you visit our Web site, the operator of the social plug-in can place a cookie on your computer that enables that operator to recognize individuals who have previously visited our site. If you are logged into the social media Web site (e.g., Facebook, Twitter) while browsing on our Web site, the social media plug-in allows that social media Web site to receive information that you have visited our Web site. The social media plug-in also allows the social media Web site to share information about your activities on our Web site with other users of their social media Web site.  


_Product Reports_

If you contact AbbVie regarding your experience in using one of our products, we may use the information that you provide in submitting reports to the US Food and Drug Administration and as otherwise required of us by law. We also may use the information to contact the prescribing physician to follow up regarding an unexpected event involving the use of our product.

**Law Enforcement**

In certain limited circumstances, AbbVie may be called upon to release your Personal Identifying Information in response to a court order, subpoena, search warrant, law, or regulation. We plan to cooperate in responding to such requests while taking appropriate measures to ensure that the requester understands the sensitive nature of the health-related personal information that they may receive. We also reserve the right to cooperate with law enforcement authorities in investigating and prosecuting users who violate our rules or who engage in behavior that is illegal or harmful to others or to others’ property.  


## PRIVACY OF CHILDREN

AbbVie does not knowingly collect or use any personal information from children (we define “children” as minors younger than 13) on AbbVie Web sites. We do not knowingly allow children to order our products, to communicate with us, or to use any of our online services. If you are a parent and become aware that your child has provided us with information, please contact us using one of the methods specified below, and we will work with you to address this issue.  


## YOUR PRIVACY CHOICES

The section below will provide you with background information and options on how you can control the use of Personal Identifying Information on our Web sites.

_Requesting a Change to How We May Use (or Not Use) Your Personal Identifying Information_

We will respond to all reasonable requests in a timely manner.  


_Voluntary Disclosures_

When you access any interactive tool, program, or service on an AbbVie Web site, you will be asked to affirmatively choose to provide the requested information. You may always choose to not provide the requested information.

**Accept Cookies**

Your browser software can be set to reject all cookies, but if you reject our cookies, certain of the functions and conveniences of our site may not work properly. Cookies and similar technologies are how we ensure that we can promptly retrieve and deliver information to you when you use our site.

**Do-Not-Track Signals and Similar Mechanisms**

Some Web browsers may transmit “do-not-track” signals to Web sites with which the browser communicates. As of the Effective Date of this Privacy Policy, an industry standard has not yet been established on how to respond to these signals. Therefore, AbbVie does not currently respond to these signals.

**Communications with AbbVie by Email**

Consumers and providers may communicate with our staff to learn more about our products and services on AbbVie Web sites. We also offer interactive tools that provide consumers and healthcare professionals with the ability to submit customized email requests for information about diseases and therapies. Please be aware that email transmissions may be vulnerable to unauthorized interception. In addition, we remind you that email sent or received through an employer’s computer or computer system is not confidential and may be the legal property of the employer.  


## DATA SECURITY

AbbVie’s practice is to secure each Web page that collects your information. Although we will make reasonable efforts to protect Personal Identifiable Information from loss, misuse, or alteration by third parties, you should be aware that there is always some risk that an unauthorized third party could intercept an Internet transmission, or that someone will find a way to thwart our security systems. We urge you to exercise caution when transmitting personal information over the Internet, especially personal information related to your health. AbbVie cannot guarantee that unauthorized third parties will not gain access to your personal information; therefore, when submitting personal information to AbbVie Web sites, you must weigh both the benefits and the risks.

## CONSENT TO PROCESSING IN THE UNITED STATES AND ELSEWHERE

This site is owned and operated by AbbVie in the United States, but the information you provide will be accessible to our affiliates, vendors, and suppliers in other countries. Furthermore, if you are visiting this site from a country other than the United States, your communication with us will necessarily result in the transfer of information across international boundaries. The level of legal protection for personal information is not the same in all countries; however, we will take the security measures described in this Privacy Policy in an effort to keep your information secure. By using this site, you consent to the collection, storage, and processing of your information in the United States and in any country to which we may transfer your information in the course of our business operations. AbbVie participates in the US Department of Commerce Safe Harbor program. You can find our Safe Harbor Policy Statement here.

We will only use personal information in the manner described in the Privacy Policy in effect when the information was collected from you. However, we reserve the right to change the terms of this Privacy Policy at any time. Any such changes to this Privacy Policy will be promptly reflected on this page. AbbVie encourages you to review this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes. Your continued use of AbbVie Web sites will be subject to the then-current Privacy Policy.
