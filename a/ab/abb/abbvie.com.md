## TYPES OF INFORMATION WE COLLECT ONLINE

The types of personal information that we may collect while you use the AbbVie Sites are described in this section and include both information that you provide to us and information that we collect automatically when you use the AbbVie Sites.

For purposes of this Privacy Notice, “ **Personal Information** ” means information that identifies you or that could reasonably be used to identify you. Examples of Personal Information include name, address, telephone number, and email address. When this information is combined with any information on health or medical status, we refer to the resulting information as “ **health-related information**.” We collect your health-related information on the AbbVie Sites only with your consent.

##### Information You Provide  


You do not have to register for a service or program to receive much of the information available through AbbVie Sites. However, some of our content is available only to registered or identified users and will require you to set up a profile or provide specific information about yourself in order to provide you the service.  


### _Personal Information You Submit During Registration or in Response to Questionnaires  _

AbbVie collects Personal Information that you provide on AbbVie Sites, for example, through an enrollment form in order to register for AbbVie programs and services, to receive marketing products and information, contact AbbVie customer service, or respond to AbbVie questionnaires or surveys. This could include:

##### Information That May Be Collected Automatically  


When you use the AbbVie Sites, we also may collect certain usage and device information automatically as described below.  


### _IP Address_

We may record the Internet Protocol (“IP”) address of your computer or other electronic device when you visit the AbbVie Sites. An IP address identifies the electronic device you use to access the Sites, which allows us to maintain communication with your computer as you move about AbbVie Sites and to customize content.  


### _Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies_

We also collect information about your use of AbbVie Sites through tracking technologies such as cookies and web beacons. A “cookie” is a unique numeric code that is transferred to your computer to track your interests and preferences and to recognize you as a return visitor. A “Web beacon” is a transparent graphic image placed on a Web site, e-mail or advertisement that enables the monitoring of things such as user activity and site traffic. These technologies help remember your preferences and allow us to bring you the content and features that are likely to be of greatest interest to you on the basis of “clickstream” data that shows your previous activities on AbbVie Sites.

For site analytics tracking, we use Google Analytics. If you do not want your data used by Google Analytics, you can install the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on at the [Google Analytics opt-out page](http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout).

To learn more about cookies and other tracking technologies, including how to disable them, please visit <http://www.allaboutcookies.org/>. Please note that some cookies are essential to the functioning of our Sites and deleting or disabling them will reduce the site’s functionality.

### _Mobile Tracking_

Some AbbVie Sites are available either as mobile applications or mobile sites that you can use on your mobile device. If you use a mobile device to access and use the AbbVie Sites, we may collect the following mobile-specific information in addition to the other information described above: device or advertising ID, device type, hardware type, media access control (“MAC”) address, international mobile equipment identity (“IMEI”), the version of your mobile operating system, the platform used to access or download the AbbVie Site (e.g., Apple, Google, Amazon, Windows), location information and usage information about your device and your use of the AbbVie Sites.  


##### Information Collected from Other Sources  


We may combine information about you from a visit to one AbbVie Site with information about you from visits to other AbbVie Sites. We may also combine information about you that is collected through the AbbVie Sites with information that we have collected offline, as well as with information provided to us by third parties.

## HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION  


We use your Personal Information to provide you the services you request, communicate with you, improve your experience on the AbbVie Sites, generally improve our products and services and for other internal business purposes, as described in more detail below.

### _Providing Programs and Services You Request_

If you choose to register for one of our services, we use the Personal Information that you provide through AbbVie Sites to respond to your questions, provide you the services you request and offer an optimal customer experience.

### _Marketing_

You may also choose to receive marketing information from AbbVie, such as offers regarding AbbVie’s products or services, invitations to participate in surveys about our products, or notifications about special promotions. In such cases, we will use your contact and other Personal Information to send you marketing information.

### _Customized User Experiences_

The Personal Information that you provide may be used to create customized offers, information, or services tailored to your interests and preferences. Also, we may use your IP address and the data that we obtain automatically through the use of cookies or similar tracking technologies to make our AbbVie Sites easier to use and navigate as well as to personalize the content provided on AbbVie Sites by anticipating the information and services that may be of interest to you.

### _Business and Product Improvement_

 In order to discover new facts that could help AbbVie better understand customer needs and help improve, develop, and evaluate product services, materials, programs, and treatments, AbbVie analyzes the information that you have provided. For these purposes AbbVie does not use information that can directly identify you.

### _Site Analytics and Improvement_

We may use the information that you provide and the information we collect automatically about your use of the AbbVie Sites to monitor user traffic patterns and preferences for site improvement, analytics and optimization.

## WHEN WE SHARE YOUR INFORMATION WITH THIRD PARTIES

We only share your Personal Information with third parties as described below. We do not sell or rent Personal Information to third parties for their own marketing purposes.

### _Third-Party Advertising and Online Behavioral Advertising  
_

You may be provided with online advertisements of AbbVie products and services on third-party websites and mobile services that are tailored to you, for example, on the basis of information that you provide to AbbVie or a third-party website you are visiting, or of your browsing activity, purchases, or interests. These types of tailored online advertisements may come through several sources, such as the following:  


  * We may share with our advertising service providers your non-identifying information that we have obtained from cookies and other tracking technologies on our AbbVie Sites.
  * Some AbbVie Sites participate in online behavioral advertising (this is also sometimes called re-target advertising or interest-based advertising). You can identify these sites by the “Advertising Choices” link in the footer. Our advertising network partners may place and use cookies on AbbVie Web sites and on other third-party Web sites to collect information about your activities in order to provide you with online advertisements that are based on your interests. When an AbbVie online behavioral advertisement is delivered to you, you will see an “Ad Choices” icon. Clicking on the icon or link will take you to a Web site where you can manage or opt out of the use of data about your browsing history that is used for the delivery of online behavioral advertisements. If you opt out, you may still see advertisements online, including advertisements from AbbVie that are based on other information (e.g., based on the content of the page being viewed rather than your prior clickstream activity). In some cases, data may still be collected about your browsing activity by these third-party advertisers, but they will not use this data to deliver advertisements that are based on your past online browsing behavior. You can also opt out now by clicking [here](https://info.evidon.com/pub_info/6678?v=1&nt=0&nw=true).
  * Some Web browsers may transmit “do-not-track” signals to Web sites with which the browser communicates. As of the Effective Date of this Privacy Notice, an industry standard has not yet been established on how to respond to these signals. Therefore, AbbVie does not currently respond to these signals. As discussed above, you can opt-out from advertisers that use your browsing history to deliver online behavioral advertisements by visiting [adchoices](https://info.evidon.com/pub_info/6678?v=1&nt=0&nw=true).  




### _Affiliates, Vendors and Suppliers_

We have relationships with various vendors and suppliers, including our affiliated companies, who help us operate our business and for whom it may be necessary to have access to your Personal Information in the course of providing services to AbbVie. We will not authorize these parties to use your Personal Information for any purpose that is not related to AbbVie’s business operation, and we require them to handle your Personal Information collected through the AbbVie Sites in accordance with this Privacy Notice.  


### _Co-branded Sites_

We may partner with other companies to provide you with content or services on a joint or “co-branded” basis. At a co‑branded site, you will see both the AbbVie logo and the logo of the co-branding partner displayed on your screen. To access the services available on a co-branded site, you may have to complete a new online registration form, and this registration information may be shared with AbbVie’s co-branding partners. You should read the individual privacy policies of our co-branding partners, as they may differ in some respects from ours. Reading these policies will help you to make an informed decision about whether to provide your information to a given site.

### _Product Reports_

If you contact AbbVie regarding your experience in using one of our products, we may use the information that you provide in submitting reports to the US Food and Drug Administration and as otherwise required of us by law. We also may use the information to contact the prescribing physician to follow up regarding an unexpected event involving the use of our product.

### _Legal Rights and Obligations_

In certain limited circumstances, AbbVie may need to disclose your Personal Information in order to comply with a legal obligation or demand, such as to comply with reporting obligations to our governing regulatory authorities regarding the safety of our pharmaceutical products, or in connection with the sale or transfer of one of our product lines or divisions, which includes the services provided through one or more of the AbbVie Sites. In such instances, we will take measures to protect your Personal Information to the extent possible. We also reserve the right to use Personal Information to investigate and prosecute users who violate our rules or who engage in behavior that is illegal or harmful to others or to others’ property.  


## PRIVACY OF CHILDREN

AbbVie does not knowingly collect or use any personal information directly from children (we define “children” as minors younger than 13) on AbbVie Sites. We do not knowingly allow children to order our products, to communicate with us, or to use any of our online services. If you are a parent and become aware that your child has provided us with information, please contact us using one of the methods specified below, and we will work with you to address this issue.

## DATA SECURITY

AbbVie maintains reasonable technical, administrative and physical controls to secure any Personal Information collected through the AbbVie Sites.

We urge you to exercise caution when transmitting Personal Information over the Internet, especially your health-related information. AbbVie cannot guarantee that unauthorized third parties will not gain access to your Personal Information; therefore, when submitting Personal Information to AbbVie Sites, you must weigh both the benefits and the risks.

## LINKS TO THIRD PARTY SITES AND Social Media Plug-ins

This Privacy Notice does not apply to AbbVie Sites that do not link to this Privacy Notice, or to third-party Web sites to which AbbVie Sites may link. AbbVie Sites may use social media plug-ins (e.g., the Facebook “Like” button, “Share to Twitter” button) to enable you to easily share information with others. When you visit AbbVie Sites, the operator of the social plug-in can place a cookie on your computer or other electronic device that enables that operator to recognize individuals who have previously visited our Site. If you are logged into the social media Web site (e.g., Facebook, Twitter) while browsing on our AbbVie Site, the social media plug-in allows that social media Web site to receive information that you have visited our AbbVie Site. The social media plug-in also allows the social media Web site to share information about your activities on our AbbVie Site with other users of their social media Web site. These sharing settings are managed by the social media Web site and governed by its privacy policy.  


## ACCESSING OUR SITES GLOBALLY

This site is owned and operated by AbbVie in the United States, but the information you provide will be accessible to our affiliates, vendors, and suppliers in other countries. Furthermore, if you are visiting this site from a country other than the United States, your communication with us will necessarily result in the transfer of information across international borders. The level of legal protection for personal information is not the same in all countries; however, we will take the security measures described in this Privacy Notice in an effort to keep your information secure. By using this site, you consent to the collection, storage, and processing of your information in the United States and in any country to which we may transfer your information in the course of our business operations.  


## CHANGES TO OUR PRIVACY notice

We will only use Personal Information in the manner described in the Privacy Notice in effect when the information was collected from you or as authorized by you. However, and subject to any applicable consent requirements, we reserve the right to change the terms of this Privacy Notice at any time. Any changes to this Privacy Notice will be reflected on this page with a new effective date. AbbVie encourages you to review this Privacy Notice regularly for any changes. Any Personal Information collected upon your continued use of AbbVie Sites will be handled in accordance with the currently-posted Privacy Notice.
