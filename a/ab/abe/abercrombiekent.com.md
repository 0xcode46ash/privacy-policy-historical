**INTERNET PRIVACY STATEMENT**

* * *

Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy, we provide this notice explaining our Internet information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used on this Web site. 

**INFORMATION COLLECTION**  
When you browse abercrombiekent.com, abercrombiekent.info, aktravel.com, aandk.com, aandktours.com and/or any Web site owned, operated, licensed or controlled by A&K and have not registered for any online service from A&K, you browse anonymously. Personal information such as your name, address, phone number, or E-mail address, is not collected as you browse. A&K does, however, use "cookies," "client variables" and "session variables" to collect information about how our site is used and our server to recognize you as an A&K online service user when you re-enter our Web site. Information, such as the server your computer is logged onto, your browser type, and whether you responded to an A&K hyperlink or E-mail, is collected and tracked in aggregate. This information is used for the purpose of measuring response rates to Web page hyperlinks and E-mail communciations as well as overall Web site activity and peformance. 

When you register for any online service from A&K, you may be asked to provide us with information such as your name, address, city, state, zip, phone number, birthdate, travel activities of interest to you and destinations to which you would like to travel. This information is used to enhance your A&K Web site experience, expedite communications, allow you to receive mailings from A&K, or to be contacted as requested. Additionally, your interest and destination information allows us to further personalize your A&K experience, customize the content of the A&K Web site and E-mail messages to meet your specific needs, and make A&K product improvements. We may also use this data in aggregate to generate market research and reports. 

**IP ADDRESSES**  
A&K collects the IP addresses used to access our Web site and the dates and times of access. This information is used to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not personally linked to identifiable information. 

**REGISTRATION FOR ONLINE PRODUCTS & SERVICES**  
In order to provide you with a particular product or service online, we may request that you voluntarily supply us with personal information, including your E-mail address, for purposes such as correspondence, site registration, submitting an application or booking request, placing an order, or participating in online surveys and/or contests. If you are known to us as a registered user of an A&K online product or service, we may combine information about your use of abercrombiekent.com, abercrombiekent.info, aktravel.com, aandk.com, aandktours.com and/or any Web site owned, operated, licensed or controlled by A&K and the online product or service you utilize with certain other online and offline information we have about you as an A&K customer and information you have provided to us as well as information available from external sources in order to customize your online experience and present you with relevant online and offline communications. 

**INFORMATION USE**  
We may use information you have given us to, for example, provide a service, ensure proper booking, measure consumer interest in our various products and services and inform you about products and services. If you have provided your E-mail address to us or to a company we've partnered with to make their products and services available to you, we may send you E-mail. These E-mails may be based on information you provided in your initial transaction with us, in surveys both online and offline, from information that may indicate purchasing preferences and lifestyle, as well as information available from external sources. These E-mails come directly from A&K. You can opt-out from receiving E-mail from A&K as described below in the section, "Declining E-mail". When we send E-mails to you, we may be able to identify information about your E-mail address, such as whether you can read graphic-rich HTML E-mails. If your E-mail address is HTML-enabled, we may choose to send you graphic-rich HTML E-mails. 

A&K does not provide your E-mail address to our business partners. However, we may send you offers on behalf of our business partners. If you take advantage of an offer from an A&K business partner and become their customer, they may independently wish to send E-Mails to you. In this case, you will need to inform them separately if you wish to decline receiving future E-mails from them. 

We may also share information with law enforcement agencies in the event of a criminal investigation or suspected illegal activity.
