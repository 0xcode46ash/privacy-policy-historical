# Privacy Statement & Security | Abercrombie & Kent

Abercrombie & Kent USA LLC (referred to in this Privacy Statement as "A&K") respects your privacy and is committed to protect the personal information that you share with us. Below is our privacy policy that applies to akresidenceclub.com, abecrombiekent.com, akextremeadventures.com, akphilanthropy.org and/or any Website (referred to in this Privacy Statement as the "Site") owned, operated, licensed or controlled by A&K. This Site is intended for use by persons who are residents of North or South America and who are over 18 years of age. By using this Site or communicating via telephone or otherwise with A&K, you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Policy.

**Information Collection**  
When you browse the Site and have not registered for any online service from A&K, you browse anonymously. Personal Information ("Personal Information" is defined as any information that identifies or can be used to identify, contact, or locate the person to whom such information pertains including, but not limited to, a first and last name, E-mail address, a home, postal or other physical address, or other contact information) is not collected as you browse. A&K does, however, use "cookies," "client variables" and "session variables" to collect information about how the Site and server are used and to recognize you as an A&K online service user when you re-enter our Site. Information, such as the server your computer is logged onto, your browser type, and whether you entered the Site via a Website or E-mail hyperlink, is collected and tracked in aggregate. This information is used for the purpose of measuring response rates to Web page and E-mail hyperlinks as well as overall Site activity and performance.

When you register for or request any Site service, you may be asked to provide us with Personal Information which is used to enhance your Site experience, expedite communications, allow you to receive electronic/postal mailings from A&K, or to be contacted as requested. Additionally, we may request your upcoming travel plans and the next destination you plan to visit which allows us to further personalize your Site and E-mail messages you may receive to meet your specific needs, as well as make A&K product improvements. We may also use this Personal Information in aggregate to generate market research reports.

**IP Addresses**  
A&K collects the IP addresses used to access our Site and the dates and times of access. This information is used to analyze trends, administer the Site, track user's movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not personally linked to identifiable information.

**Registration for Online Products & Services**  
In order to provide you with a particular Site product or service, we may request that you voluntarily supply us with Personal Information for purposes such as correspondence, Site registration, submitting an information or booking request, placing an order, requesting product descriptions, or participating in Site surveys and/or contests. If you are known to us as a registered user of an A&K Site, we may combine information about your use of Site products or services with certain other online and offline information we have about you as an A&K customer as well as information available from external sources in order to customize your Site experience and present you with relevant online and offline communications.

**Information Use**  
We may use Personal Information you have given us with any of our group of companies, including our parent companies and any of our subsidiaries or commonly-owned companies, to for example, provide a service, ensure proper booking, measure consumer interest in our various products and services and inform you about products and services. If you have provided your E-mail address to us or to a company we've partnered with to make their products and services available to you, we may send you E-mail. These E-mails may be based on Personal Information you provided in your initial transaction with us, in surveys both online and offline, from information that may indicate purchasing preferences and lifestyle, as well as available from external sources. These E-mails come directly from A&K. You can opt-out from receiving E-mail from A&K as described below in the section, "Declining E-mail." When we send you E-mail, we may use your E-mail address to identify information about your receipt of the E-mail, including whether the communication was opened, how many times it was viewed and whether you clicked on an embedded hyperlink to reach a particular web page. This information is used to measure response rates to E-mail communications as well as enhance your Site experience.

A&K does not provide your Personal Information to our business partners. However, we may send you offers on behalf of our business partners. If you take advantage of an offer from an A&K business partner and become their customer, they may independently wish to send E-Mails to you. In this case, you will need to inform them separately if you wish to decline receiving future E-mails from them.

We may share Personal Information with law enforcement agencies in the event of a criminal investigation or suspected illegal activity.

When you elect to do this, you will be required to enter your E-mail address and name, the recipient's E-mail address and name, a subject line, and a text message that will go to the receiver. This will generate a pre-formatted E-mail message that will go from you to the receiver's mailbox with your message embedded in the text of the E-mail.
