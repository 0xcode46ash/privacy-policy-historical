**PRIVACY AND SECURITY STATEMENT**

As with all clients of AbelCine, we respect your privacy online.

Any and all information collected on this site is fully encrypted and will be kept strictly confidential. At no time will your information be sold, reused, rented, disclosed or loaned.

All transactions made through the Cine Store are processed by our secure server. Credit cards are processed through VeriSign and at no time do we store your credit card numbers.

All orders are initially verified by VeriSign or PayPal. In certain cases, we will need to contact you for more information: if one of our payment processors cannot verify your information, or if your transaction is over a certain amount. 

In these cases, an AbelCine sales representative will phone you to discuss your transaction. For the protection of your identity and the security of your order, you will be asked to fax us a copy of the credit card used for this transaction, the credit card's CCV number, the last four digits of your social security number and your signature.

If you choose to ship your order to an address other than your credit cardâ€™s billing address, we can only accept payment by PayPal. 

For all PayPal customers, we can only ship to verified accounts or confirmed addresses with a signature required.

If you have any questions, please feel free to contact [orders@abelcine.com](mailto:orders@abelcine.com) for more information.
