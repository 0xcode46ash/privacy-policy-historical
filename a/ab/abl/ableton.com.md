# Ableton Privacy Policy | Ableton

The personal data of our customers shall be treated with utmost confidentiality. Only data to the extent technically necessary shall be collected. Under no circumstance shall collected data be passed on to third parties for unauthorized reasons.

### 1\. Scope and purpose of data collection

Personal data, i.e. details regarding the personal and/or material circumstances of certain identifiable individuals, shall be collected and used insofar as required for the use of the website and for the purchasing of products. Specifically this shall include collecting and exploiting data required to process user interactions and to make contact with the web shop (e.g. customer name, IP address, postal address and email address).

### 2\. Inventory data (collection/use and deletion)

2.1 Personal data shall be only collected and used insofar as necessary for 1) the establishment, structuring or modification of contractual relationships with customers or 2) the initiation and conclusion of contractual agreements in the context of website use (inventory data).

2.2 Inventory data shall be deleted promptly once it is no longer needed for the purposes specified in Clause 2.1 above. This shall not apply insofar as the data in question is being collected and used pursuant to some legal requirement or as billing data or usage data pursuant to Clauses 3 and/or 4, respectively.

2.3 In individual cases, we may have an obligation to disclose inventory data for the purposes of law enforcement, averting danger, and/or for use by the police, government, or other authorities.

### 3\. Usage data (collection/use and deletion)

3.1 Only the necessary extent of personal data shall be collected and used with respect to use of our web pages for initiating, concluding and executing contractual agreements. This shall include, among other things, data regarding user characteristics (name, IP address, postal address, email address), data regarding the beginning, end and extent of use of the web pages, as well as data regarding the telemedia services and other services used. We may also transmit such data to our subcontractors insofar and for as long as this is required for the dispatch of merchandise.

3.2 As a general rule, collected usage data shall be deleted or anonymized once the corresponding user interaction has been completed, unless such data has been collected/used as inventory or billing data pursuant to Clause 2 and/or 4, respectively, or pursuant to some legal provision. Data may be used beyond the completion of user interaction only insofar as far as it is needed for further interactions, for billing or for other services.

### 4\. Billing data (determination of charges and billing)

4.1 Data may be collected and used insofar as it is required to determine charges (such as purchase prices) and process payments. This shall include collecting and processing the usage data specified under Clause 3 as well as data needed to determine the charges owed, such as payment records and accounting data.

4.2 Billing data may be collected and used beyond completion of the billing cycle (e.g., full payment of invoices) only insofar as required by law or insofar as such data qualifies as inventory or usage data pursuant to Clause 2 and/or 3, respectively.

4.3 If there are clear indications that our website has been used with the intent of not paying (or not paying in full) for such use, we are entitled to use the personal data of the offending user beyond the end of usage to the extent necessary for prosecution. Once this is no longer the case, and assuming there is no further obligation to exploit such data, we will delete it promptly.

### 5\. Google Universal Analytics and Online Advertising

5.1 This website features Google Universal Analytics, a web-analysis service provided by Google Inc., 600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA ("Google"). Google Universal Analytics uses "cookies" that are stored on your (i.e. the user’s) computer. “Cookies” allow us to analyze your use of our website. The cookie-generated data regarding your use of this website will generally be forwarded to a Google server in the U.S. and stored there. In case of activation of the IP anonymization on this website, your IP address will be truncated by Google within Member States of the European Union or other parties to the Agreement on the European Economic Area before. Only in exceptional cases, the full IP address is sent to a Google server in the USA and is shortened there. On behalf of the operator of this website, Google will use this information to evaluate your use of the website, to compile reports on website activity and to provide other with website and internet related services to the site operator. The IP address transmitted by your browser as part of Google Universal Analytics is not merged with other data held by Google.

Additionally, a so-called User-ID will be used on this website. This ID is not assigned to a particular device but to you personally. The User-ID enables the analysis of your behavior across devices (smartphone, tablet, notebook). The allocation of the User-ID to a user ensues once we have unequivocally identified you as a user. This happens generally when you are using your Ableton User-Account. As soon as you have logged-in for the first time, a User-ID is allocated to you accordingly. It contains a unique, persistent, and non-personally identifiable string for a signed user. Once you log into our website the User-ID is sent to Google Analytics. As far as Google is concerned, [the User-ID functions as your pseudonym](https://support.google.com/analytics/?hl=en#topic=3544906). Google connects your online behavior and the User-ID to a profile. Google only receives the User-ID, not the information contained in the above-mentioned profile or other personal data of yours. A summarized version of the profile thus created is accessible to us. We do not attach any other of your personally identifiable data to the profile connected to a User-ID.

You can object with future effect to the above-described data collection for the respective device by making use of the [Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/181881?hl=en).

5.2 This website also uses the Google AdWords remarketing feature to advertise online. Third-party vendors, including Google, show our ads on sites across the Internet. We and third-party vendors, including Google use cookies for this purpose. By combining first-party cookies (such as the Google Universal Analytics cookie) and third-party cookies (such as the DoubleClick cookie) ads are optimized and served based on your past visits to our website.

### 6\. Handling of data in case of suspected unlawful use

Insofar as there are factual indications of fraudulent acquisition or other illegal uses of our services, we will be entitled to collect and exploit personal data in order to detect and prevent such unlawful use, as well as to enforce our own legal claims.

### 7\. Collecting usage data in anonymous form as part of the Ableton Live and Ableton Suite (both hereinafter referred to as “Software“) Usage Reports
