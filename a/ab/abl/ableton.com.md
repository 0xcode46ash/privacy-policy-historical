# Ableton - Privacy Policy

The personal data of our customers shall be treated with utmost confidentiality. Only data to the extent tech-nically necessary shall be collected. Under no circumstance shall collected data be passed on to third parties for unauthorized reasons.

### 1\. Scope and purpose of data collection 

Personal data, i.e. details regarding the personal and/or material circumstances of certain identifiable individuals, shall be collected and used insofar as required for the use of the website and for the purchasing of products. Specifically this shall include collecting and exploitating data required to process user interactions and to make contact with the web shop (e.g. customer name, IP address, postal address and email address).

### **2\. Inventory data (collection/use and deletion)**

2.1 Personal data shall be only collected and used insofar as necessary for 1) the establishment, struc-turing or modification of contractual relationships with customers or 2) the initiation and conclusion of contractual agreements in the context of website use (inventory data).

2.2 Inventory data shall be deleted promptly once it is no longer needed for the purposes specified in Clause 2.1 above. This shall not apply insofar as the data in question is being collected and used pursuant to some legal requirement or as billing data or usage data pursuant to Clauses 3 and/or 4, respectively.

2.3 In individual cases, we may have an obligation to disclose inventory data for the purposes of law enforcement, averting danger, and/or for use by the police, government, or other authorities.

### 3\. Usage data (collection/euse and deletion)

3.1 Only the necessary extent of personal data shall be collected and used with respect to use of our web pages for initiating, concluding and executing contractual agreements. This shall include, among other things, data regarding user characteristics (name, IP address, postal address, email address), data regarding the beginning, end and extent of use of the web pages, as well as data re-garding the telemedia services and other services used. We may also transmit such data to our sub-contractors insofar and for as long as this is required for the dispatch of merchandise.  

3.2 As a general rule, collected usage data shall be deleted or anonymized once the corresponding user interaction has been completed, unless such data has been collected/used as inventory or billing data pursuant to Clause 2 and/or 4, respectively, or pursuant to some legal provision. Data may be used beyond the completion of user interaction only insofar as far as it is needed for further interac-tions, for billing or for other services.

### **4\. Billing data (determination of charges and billing)**

4.1 Data may be collected and used insofar as it is required to determine charges (such as purchase prices) and process payments. This shall include collecting and processing the usage data specified under Clause 3 as well as data needed to determine the charges owed, such as payment records and accounting data.

4.2 Billing data may be collected and used beyond completion of the billing cycle (e.g., full payment of invoices) only insofar as required by law or insofar as such data qualifies as inventory or usage data pursuant to Clause 2 and/or 3, respectively.

4.3 If there are clear indications that our website has been used with the intent of not paying (or not pay-ing in full) for such use, we are entitled to use the personal data of the offending user beyond the end of usage to the extent necessary for prosecution. Once this is no longer the case, and assuming there is no further obligation to exploit such data, we will delete it promptly. 

### **5\. Google Analytics**

Our web pages feature Google Analytics, a web-analysis service provided by Google Inc. ("Google"). Google Analytics uses "cookies" that are stored on your (i.e. the user’s) computer. “Cookies” allow us to analyze your use of our web pages. The cookie-generated data regarding your use of this website (including your IP address) will be forwarded to a Google server in the U.S. and stored there. Google may use this information to evaluate your use of our web pages, to compile reports on website activity for website operators, and to provide other website/internet-related services. Google may also transmit this information to third parties, insofar as required by law or insofar as Google has commissioned said third parties to process the data on its behalf. However, Google will not connect your IP address with any other data held by Google. You may block the use of cookies by selecting the appropriate settings on your browser. Please note, however, that this may prevent you from using the website’s full range of features. By using this site, you are authorizing Google to process your personal data in the manner and for the purposes described above.

### 6\. Handling of data in case of suspected unlawful use

Insofar as there are factual indications of fraudulent acquisition or other illegal uses of our services, we will be entitled to collect and exploit personal data in order to detect and prevent such unlawful use, as well as to enforce our own legal claims. 

### 7. Collecting usage data in anonymous form as part of the Ableton Live and Ableton Suite (both hereinafter referred to as “Software“) Usage Reports 

If the “Usage Report“ function has been activated in the Software settings, data about the use of the Software by the user are transferred to us in anonymous form when there is an internet connection. Such data includes inter alia:
