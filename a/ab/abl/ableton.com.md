2.2 Inventory data shall be deleted promptly once it is no longer needed for the purposes specified in Clause 2.1 above.

We may also transmit such data to our subcontractors insofar and for as long as this is required for the dispatch of merchandise.

4.2 Billing data may be collected and used beyond completion of the billing cycle (e.g., full payment of invoices) only insofar as required by law or insofar as such data qualifies as inventory or usage data pursuant to Clause 2 and/or 3, respectively.

4.3 If there are clear indications that our website has been used with the intent of not paying (or not paying in full) for such use, we are entitled to use the personal data of the offending user beyond the end of usage to the extent necessary for prosecution.
