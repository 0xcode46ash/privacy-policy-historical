# Privacy Policy | AboveTheInfluence.com

Through its National Youth Anti-Drug Media Campaign, the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) created the AbovetheInfluence Web site to help teens become more aware of and assess influences around them, including drugs. We take your privacy very seriously. In compliance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, and the online privacy guidelines of the White House Office of Management and Budget, we do not sell, share or rent any personally identifying information about you.

**COPPA**  
We will never knowingly request personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13, to remain consistent with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) of 1998.

**Information You Submit**  
The information we receive depends upon what you do when visiting this site. If you want to send us your comments, you will be asked to enter a nickname or handle. 

If you choose to submit a request to the "Contact Us" submission page, we will request your e-mail address only for the purpose of responding. We do not store or share these e-mail addresses and it is not required that an email address be entered here. 

If you choose to submit a Creative Submission (message, photo, poetry, video etc.) to the MOX section of the site, AbovetheInfluence.com will adhere to the following guidelines: 

**I.** In order to submit a Creative Submission, we require following information:   
Screen Name (which is a nickname, NOT your legal name)   
* If you are an AOL user, please be sure to alter the screen name you submit to us, because AOL screen names function as e-mail addresses too.   
Age

The following registration information is optional: 

State of Residence 

E-mail address  
(So we can notify you if we publish your Creative Submission.)

Please note, none of the information we require through the registration process is personally identifiable information. 

**II.** To upload (electronically submit) your Creative Submission, you will not have to reveal personally identifiable information. 

While your screen name and your state of residence may be collected if you upload a creative submission to AbovetheInfluence.com, submissions that incorporate any personally identifiable information will be immediately removed from consideration for online posting. For the MOX photo and video submissions, AbovetheInfluence may require an additional parental release to be signed.
