**Children's Privacy**

> This statement discloses the privacy practices for portions of About.com directed at children under 13. About.com will NOT: 
> 
>   * collect online contact information from a user under 13 without prior verifiable parental consent, which includes an opportunity for the parent to prevent use of the information and participation in the activity. When we do not obtain prior verifiable parental consent, online contact information will be used only to directly respond to the child's request and will not be used to contact the child for other purposes.
>   * collect personally identifiable offline contact information from users under 13 without prior verifiable parental consent.
>   * distribute to third parties any personally identifiable information collected from a child under 13 without prior verifiable parental consent.
>   * give the ability to children to send e-mail, create personal web pages, participate in forums or kids chat rooms without prior verifiable parental consent.
>   * entice a child under 13 by the prospect of a special game, prize or other activity, to divulge more information than is needed to participate in such activity.
> 
We will also place prominent notice wherever personally identifiable information is collected requesting the child to ask a parent for permission to proceed. 

**COPPA**

> Because we care about the safety and privacy of children online, we comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA). COPPA and its accompanying FTC regulation establish United States federal law that protects the privacy of children using the Internet. We offer the following for the protection of children under 13: 
> 
>   * Many About.com activities may collect information about children under 13, including e-mail, personal web pages, forum participation, and kids chat rooms. Use of such activities requires initial registration by the participant. Children under 13 who wish to register are asked to have a parent or legal guardian do so for them. The parent must provide a credit card number for verification that he/she is an adult. Upon verification, the parent can choose which activities he or she would like the child to participate in. The parent can change the selected activities at any time.
>   * If we obtain parental consent, we collect and maintain the name, date of birth, and email address of children who register. We use this information to contact children for subscription to newsletters and notification of contests. Parents can review their child's personal information, ask to have it deleted and refuse to allow any further collection or use of their child's information. Parents can review this information by logging on as a member and clicking on the Parental Controls link in their membership profile.
>   * We do not distribute to third parties any personally identifiable information collected from children under 13 or from sites that are specifically directed to children under 13.
>   * We use a technology called "cookies" to track what pages users visit on our service, as described in the previous section of this document. We also use cookies to check the age of registered users who enter chat rooms in sites located outside of the Kids channel. Users under 13 are not permitted in chat rooms unless their parents have consented to their participation, as above.
