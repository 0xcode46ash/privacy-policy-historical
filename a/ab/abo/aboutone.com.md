Privacy Policy

AboutOne's Privacy Policy is designed to help you understand how we collect and use the personal information you decide to share, and help you make informed decisions when using AboutOne, located at www.aboutone.com and its directly associated domains (collectively, "AboutOne" or "Website" or “Site”)

By using or accessing AboutOne, you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Policy.

Collection of Personal Information from Site Users

From time to time, our process requires us to collect personally identifiable information about you in order that we may appropriately serve you. For instance, we may collect such personally identifiable information such as your name, e-mail address, sex, age or family member information.  Providing us with other information is at your option. Like many web sites, we may also automatically receive general information that is contained in our server log files such as your IP address and cookie information. Subject to the foregoing, AboutOne.com may collect or track (1) the home server domain names, e-mail addresses, type of client computer, files downloaded, search engine used, operating system, and type of Web browser of visitors to the Site, (2) the e-mail addresses of visitors that communicate with AboutOne.com via e-mail, (3) information knowingly provided by the visitor in online forms, registration forms, surveys, e-mail, and other online avenues (including, without limitation, demographic and personal profile data), and (4) aggregate and user-specific information regarding which pages Site visitors access. AboutOne.com may place Internet “cookies” on visitors’ hard drives. Internet cookies save data about individual visitors, such as the visitor’s name, password, user-name, shopping cart, screen preferences, and the pages of a site viewed by the visitor. When the visitor revisits the Site, AboutOne.com may recognize the visitor by the Internet cookie and customize the visitor’s experience accordingly. Visitors may decline Internet cookies, if any, by using the appropriate feature of their Web client software, if available. When a visitor performs a search within the AboutOne.com, AboutOne.com without limitation, may record information identifying the visitor or linking the visitor to the search performed. AboutOne.com may also record limited information for every search request and use that information to solve technical problems with the services available directly or indirectly in connection with the Site and to calculate overall usage statistics.

Use of Personal Data Collected

Personal data collected by AboutOne.com may be used by AboutOne.com for many reasons, for example, for editorial and feedback purposes, for marketing and promotional purposes, for a statistical analysis of users’ behavior, for product development, for content improvement, for fulfillment of a requested transaction by a service provide, e.g. PayPal or recordkeeping, or to customize the content and layout of the Site. Aggregate data on visitors’ home servers may be used for internal purposes, and individually identifying information, such as names, postal and e-mail addresses, phone numbers, and other personal information which visitors voluntarily provide to AboutOne.com, may be added to AboutOne.com’s databases and used for future calls and mailings regarding Site updates, new products and services, and upcoming events. AboutOne.com also may use Site visitor data to contact the Site visitors regarding account status and changes to the subscriber agreement (if applicable), Privacy Policy, and any other policies or agreements relevant to Site visitors.  AboutOne.com employees do not have access to your individual data, but can run summarized user reports as a way to better offer you services.  AboutOne.com employees will never, under any circumstance, have access to any of the data in your AboutOne.com Lock Box.

While AboutOne.com may undertake efforts to see that any third party to which AboutOne.com shares or otherwise discloses personal data is under an obligation to use the personal data solely for the purposes for which the data was disclosed, such third parties are independent third parties over which AboutOne.com exercises no control.
