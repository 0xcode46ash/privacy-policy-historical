**Our Commitment To Privacy**

Nothing is more important to the owners and staff of AboveTopSecret.com than making every effort to protect the privacy of all members. To better protect your privacy we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used. 

**The Information We Collect:**

This notice applies to all information collected or submitted on the AboveTopSecret.com website, and any other site owned and operated by AboveTopSecret.com and/or The Above Network, LLC. On some pages, you can specify personal profiles that may be viewable by other registered members of this website. However, at no time do we collect your personal information such as name, address, or phone number, and only require a functioning e-mail address for membership. At no time do we attempt to reconcile any information you provide (included your IP address as indicated below) with offline identity or other personal information. 

**The Way We Use Information:**

We use the information you provided about yourself at registration to authorize your access when you post messages on our discussion forum. We also record IP address you're using at the time of each posted messages. 

We use the e-mail address you provided to confirm your discussion board password. Your addresses are not used for any other purpose other than registration for the AboveTopSecret.com email newsletters, and will never be shared with outside parties and are not viewable by unregistered members. 

To receive newsletters and administrative emails, you must first respond in the affirmative to the opt-in notification email you will receive soon after joining the site or subscribing to the email newsletter service. If you do not opt-in, you will receive no newsletters or promotional emails. You may opt-out of the emails at any time by clicking the opt-out link in each email, replying to the email with the subject line "unsubscribe," or going to [list.abovetopsecret.com/member](http://list.abovetopsecret.com/member). 

We use non-identifying and aggregate information to better design our website and to share with advertisers. For example, we may tell an advertiser that X number of individuals visited a certain area on our website, or that Y number of men and Z number of women filled out our registration form, but we would never disclose anything that could be used to identify any individuals. 

The non-identifying aggregate information is not stored on any server owned by AboveTopSecret.com as we do not collect nor store any log files of activity on our websites. Instead, we employ the Google Analytics software (which does set a cookie) to obtain traffic analysis data. 

Finally, we never use or share the personally identifiable information provided to us online in ways unrelated to the ones described above. Your profile information is protected from web-spiders that search for e-mail addresses and other personal information. We reserve the right to disclose any personally identifiable information associated with your account and/or posting history as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on The Above Network, LLC. 

**Voluntary Input Of Personally Identifiable Information:**

We are not responsible for the personally identifiable information you choose to submit in these forums and services, and may, at our discretion, remove any personally identifiable information you submit that appears in public view. 

**Data Cookies:**

From time to time data cookies will be set by various portions of the application code that runs the forums, features, games, and other specialty items running on our web servers. At no time is any personally identifying information (other than site username) ever stored in these cookies. The cookies are used to provide our application with page-to-page awareness of your user status and/or access privileges. Most of these cookies expire within days, however, some may expire in moths or years.

Staff and/or owners will not observe the content or flow of any private messaging unless explicit reports of Terms & Conditions violations are received. The private messages may be subject to run-time content filtering (such as vulgarities) that is used to filter the content of thread posts.

You can access all your profile information that we collect online and maintain by AboveTopSecret.com. We use this procedure to better safeguard your information. Use the "Member Center" link in the top of the discussion board menu-bar.

At such time as this becomes required, your privacy, and that of your source, will be guaranteed by the ownership of AboveTopSecret.com via a legally binding non-disclosure agreement (NDA).
