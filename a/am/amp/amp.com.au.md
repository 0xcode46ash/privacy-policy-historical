# AMP - amp.com.au - Privacy statement

This Privacy Statement is made on behalf of AMP Limited and all references to "AMP", "we", "us", or "our" in this statement are references to AMP Limited (ABN 49 079 354 519) and its related bodies corporate. 

### Protecting your information is important

At AMP, we understand the importance you attach to information that identifies you (your 'personal information') and want to help you protect it. We want you to be able to deal with us in full confidence that your personal information will only be dealt with by us in the ways we have described to you and that it will be held securely.

This Privacy Statement tells you how we collect information when you visit this site and what we do with it.

### What information we collect about you and what we do with it

AMP collects information about you each time you come to any part of the AMP website. We collect information about the time, date, duration and usage of the AMP website. We also collect information regarding the last site you visited before coming to the AMP website. 

AMP uses non-personalised statistics about the use of our website to continually improve it and to improve our customer service.

If you submit information to an AMP company either using an electronic form or application or by sending an email we collect that information and use it for the purposes that you have provided it. For example, if you apply online for a managed fund, AMP will use the information to process your application and administer your investment once it is established.

We will use your contact details to help us administer your products. In this way, we can keep you informed and up to date - for example, through annual statements or regular reports, newsletters or details of product changes. 

In addition, we may use your information to provide you with special offers, information about new products and special promotions which we think may interest you. If you do not want to receive this information, you can let us know by sending AMP an email at [AMPeServices@amp.com.au](mailto:AMPeServices@amp.com.au) or call **1300 300 465**. Please provide us with your customer details including name, address and contact number. In addition, indicate if you do not wish to receive anymore promotional material.

We won't sell or give our customer lists to third parties for promotions independent of AMP.

We do not collect information you enter when using interactive devices on our site, for example, the superannuation calculator.

### What is a Cookie and what are they used for?

A cookie is a text file placed into the memory of your computer by our computers. A copy of this text file can be retrieved by our computer.

### If you think the information we hold about you is incorrect or you want to update it

We rely on the accuracy of the information you provide to us. If you think that we hold information about you that is incorrect in any way, or out of date, or you simply want to notify us of something new, please send AMP an email at [AMPeServices@amp.com.au](mailto:AMPeServices@amp.com.au)

### Our security procedures

In designing this web site, we have incorporated security procedures and practices that we consider are consistent with Australian industry practice. We review our security procedures from time to time and update them when relevant.

Personal information about you and your business with AMP is only accessible by you and by those who are authorised by us to access it. They also must use a password, and are bound to safeguard the information and access it only for approved business purposes. 

Your password is your key to accessing your information, and so you should keep it securely. It is also good practice to change it periodically. You can do this online (for example in "My Portfolio" or by using the the "change password" facility within the "services" section of BankNet) or by calling **1300 300 465** (or **13 30 30** for BankNet). 

You should also ensure that once you have finished accessing the secure parts of our site (such as My Portfolio) you log off. Otherwise, others may be able to access your details and make transactions without your authority

.

As additional security, My Portfolio has a timeout facility that automatically logs users out of the system after a period of inactivity, currently 15 minutes.

### Links to other sites

You are able to access various other sites by clicking on links that we have provided. You should be aware that other sites are not subject to our privacy standards and procedures. You will need to contact them directly to ascertain their privacy standards.

### Changes to our Privacy Statement

This information relates to our current privacy standards. We may vary our privacy standards from time to time. We will notify you of these changes by publishing them on this website - we will not separately notify you of these changes.

### Feedback

If you have any comments or suggestions regarding our website or this privacy statement please use our online feedback form.
