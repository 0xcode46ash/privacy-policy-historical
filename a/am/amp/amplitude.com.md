# Amplitude: Privacy Policy | Mobile Analytics

**Last Updated: February 17, 2015**

This Privacy Policy explains how information is collected and utilized by Amplitude, Inc. ("Amplitude," "we," or "us"). This Privacy Policy applies to the Amplitude website at http://www.amplitude.com and Amplitude's services.

### App Developer Information

Amplitude collects personally identifiable information from you, such as email address, when you sign up for our service or contact us by email. We also track many of the actions you take on our site in order to improve the service. We will never share this information with anyone for any reason unless required by law.

We understand that the data you send to us is confidential and treat it as such. We will never share the data you send us with anyone unless required by law. Access will be restricted to the team members you invite, and to certain Amplitude staff in order to provide support and develop the service.

We reserve the right to analyze this data from an aggregated standpoint, and publish aggregated studies and figures. In doing so we will never compromise the confidentiality of your data by publishing any identifying information.

### End User Information

We may collect non-personally identifiable information regarding the behavior and usage patterns of users of mobile applications ("End Users") published by our customers. Use of our services does not require collection of personally identifiable information. Our customers may request such information from End Users in order to use their mobile applications and such personally identifiable information may be included in the data sent to us. End Users should therefore review the privacy policies of the mobile applications they use to assess the security of any personally identifiable information they disclose. To the extent we do receive any personally identifiable information, we will maintain the confidentiality of such data.

### Cookies

We use cookies to access information when you sign in, store your preferences, to keep you logged in, and to store a limited amount of behavioral data. You can configure your browser to accept or reject these cookies and we will respect this decision by not using other means to track you.

### Updates and Changes to Privacy Policy

Please note that we reserve the right, at any time, to add to, change, update, or modify this Privacy Policy. We will notify you of any changes by updating this page. If, in our reasonable discretion, the changes are material we will post a notice on our website or send you an email. Information collected will be subject to the Privacy Policy in place at the time of collection.

### Contacts

If you have any comments, concerns or questions about this Privacy Policy, please send us an email at [contact@amplitude.com](mailto:contact@amplitude.com).
