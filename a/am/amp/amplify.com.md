1\. Introduction

Amplify Education, Inc. (“Amplify” or “we”) wants you to be familiar with how we collect, use and disclose your information. This Privacy Policy describes our practices in connection with information that we may collect through your use of the site [www.amplify.com](http://www.amplify.com/) (the “Site”). By providing personal information to us and using the Site, you agree to the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy.

As set forth in our [Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/web/20130501082830id_/http%3A//amplify.com/terms-of-use), the Site is for a general audience, is not targeted to children, and does not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 years of age.

This Privacy Policy applies to all users, including both those who use the Site without being registered and those who have registered with the Site. This Privacy Policy applies to any collection and use by Amplify of your personal information (i.e., information that identifies a specific person, such as full name or email address) provided in connection with your use of the Site. It also describes generally Amplify’s practices for handling non-personal information (e.g., interests, demographics and services usage) in connection with the Site.

2\. Collection of information

Some of the information collected may be personal information and some may not identify you as a specific person.

Registration Information is the information required to register for certain functionality which may be available on the Site, which may include, for example, the ability to post comments on the Site or to receive communications from Amplify. Registration Information may include, for example, name, email address, gender, zip code and birthday.

Public Information and Posts consist of comments or content that you post to the Site and the information about you that accompanies those posts or content, which may include a name, user name, comments, likes, status, profile information and picture. Public Information and Posts are always public, which means they are available to everyone and may be displayed in search results on external search engines.

Social Media Information and Content. If you access the Site through another website, application (“app”) or log-in (“Other Service”), or connect a Site service to Other Services, the information we collect may also include your user ID and/or user name associated with that Other Service, any information or content the Other Service shares with us, such as your profile picture, email address or friends lists, and any information you have made public in connection with that Other Service (collectively, “Social Media Information and Content”). When you access the Site through Other Services or when you connect a Site service to Other Services, you are authorizing Amplify to collect, store, and use any and all Social Media Information and Content in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

Site Activity Information. When you access and interact with the Site, we and our service providers may collect certain information about those visits. For example, our servers receive and record information about your computer and browser, including potentially your IP address, browser type, and other software or hardware information. If you access the Site from a mobile or other device, we may collect a unique device identifier assigned to that device, geolocation data, or other characteristics of the device hardware, operating system and configurations for that device.

Cookies and other tracking technologies (such as browser cookies, pixels, beacons, and Adobe Flash technology, including cookies), which are comprised of small bits of data that often include a de-identified or anonymous unique identifier, may also be used. Websites send these data to your browser when you first request a web page and then store the data on your computer or mobile or other device so the website can access information when you make subsequent requests for pages from that website or app. These technologies may also be used to collect and store information about your usage of sites you visit (such as the Site), including search queries you have run and advertising you have seen.

Third parties may support the Site by providing services, such as allowing you to share content or tracking aggregate Site usage statistics. They may also use these technologies to collect similar information about your usage of the Site and other websites or services. Amplify does not control these third-party technologies and their use is governed by the privacy policies of the third parties using such technologies. For more information about third-party advertising networks and similar entities that use these technologies, see [www.aboutads.info/consumers](http://www.aboutads.info/consumers), and, to opt-out of such ad networks’ and services’ advertising practices, go to [www.aboutads.info/choices](http://www.aboutads.info/choices).

Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies, but your browser may permit you to change your settings to notify you of a cookie being set or updated, or to block cookies altogether. Please consult the "Help" section of your browser for more information (e.g., <http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Block-or-allow-cookies>). Users can manage the use of Flash technologies with the Flash management tools available at Adobe’s website, see <http://www.adobe.com/products/flashplayer/security/privacy_policy/faq.html>. Please note that by blocking any or all cookies you may not have access to certain features, content or personalization available through the Site.

Information from Other Sources. To improve the quality of the Site and services, we and our service providers may supplement any information we collect with information from other sources, such as publicly available information from social media services and commercially available sources and information from our affiliated education companies and business partners.

3\. Notice and choice

Means of Notice. This Privacy Policy is the primary means by which the Site provides you with notice and choice regarding its collection and use of your personal information.

Updates to Privacy Policy; Choice. Amplify may modify this Privacy Policy. Please look at the Effective Date at the top of this Privacy Policy to see when this Privacy Policy was last revised. Any changes to this Privacy Policy will become effective when we post the revised Privacy Policy on the Site.

Location of Data. The Site is hosted in and managed out of the United States. If you are a user located outside the United States, you understand and consent to having any personal information processed in the United States. United States data protection and other relevant laws may not be the same as those in your jurisdiction. This includes the use of cookies and other tracking technologies as described above. As a result, please read this Privacy Policy with care.

Linked Services. The Site may also be linked to sites operated by unaffiliated companies, and may carry advertisements or offer content, functionality, games, newsletters, contests or sweepstakes, or applications developed and maintained by unaffiliated companies. Amplify is not responsible for the privacy practices of unaffiliated companies, and once you leave the Site via a link or enable an unaffiliated service, you should check the applicable privacy policy of the unaffiliated service.

4\. Use and disclosure

We may use any personal information and other information we collect from and about you for the following purposes:

To provide and manage the Site. We use the information we collect from and about you to provide the Site and features to you, including to measure and improve its services and features, to personalize your experience by delivering relevant content, marketing messages, to allow you to comment on content, to provide you with customer support, and to respond to inquiries. We may also use aggregate or anonymous data about your use of and activity on the Site to assist us in this regard.

To allow service providers to assist us in providing and managing the Site. Amplify may make your information available to certain third-party service providers, such as contractors, agents or sponsors, who help us manage or provide the Site.

To allow social sharing functionality. If you log in with or connect your social media account with the Site, we may share your social media user name, picture, and likes, as well as your activities and comments with other Site users and with your friends associated with your social media account. We may also share the same information with your social media account provider. By logging in with or connecting your Site account and your social media account, you are authorizing the Site to share information with your social media account provider, other users and your friends and you understand that the use of the shared information will be governed by the social media site’s privacy policy. If you do not want your personal information shared in this way, please do not connect your social media account with your Site account and do not participate in social sharing on the Site.

To contact you. Amplify may periodically send promotional materials (e.g., newsletters) or notifications related to the Site and to Amplify's business to the email address you provided to us at registration. If you want to stop receiving promotional materials from Amplify, you can email us at [privacy@amplify.com](mailto:privacy@amplify.com) or follow the unsubscribe instructions at the bottom of each email. There are certain service notification emails that you may not opt-out of, such as notifications of changes to the Site or policies.

To share with our affiliates. Amplify may share your information with Amplify’s affiliated education companies, including Wireless Generation, Inc. (“Wireless Generation”), for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy. Users who visit Wireless Generation’s sites should still refer to their separate privacy policies, which may differ in some respects from this Privacy Policy.

To protect the rights of Amplify and our users. There may be instances when Amplify may disclose your information without providing notice or choice, including situations where Amplify has a good faith belief that such disclosure is necessary in order to: (i) protect, enforce, or defend the legal rights, privacy, safety, or property of Amplify, our parents, subsidiaries or affiliates or our or their employees, agents and contractors (including enforcement of our agreements, including our terms of use); (ii) protect the safety, privacy, and security of users of the Site or members of the public; (iii) protect against fraud or for risk management purposes; (iv) comply with the law or legal process; or (v) respond to requests from public and government authorities.

To complete a merger or sale of assets. If Amplify sells all or part of its business or makes a sale or transfer of its assets or is otherwise involved in a merger or transfer of all or a material part of its business, Amplify may transfer your information to the party or parties involved in the transaction as part of that transaction.

When the information collected from or about you does not identify you as a specific person, we may use that information for any purpose or share it with third parties. In some instances, we may combine that information with personal information, such as combining your zip code with your name. If we combine this information with personal information, the combined information will be treated by us as personal information as long as it is combined.

5\. Security

Amplify uses commercially reasonable administrative, technical, personnel and physical measures to safeguard information in its possession against loss, theft and unauthorized use, disclosure or modification. However, the complete safety of your information cannot be guaranteed.

6\. User control

If you would like to review, correct, update, suppress or otherwise limit our use of your personal information you have previously provided directly to us, you may contact us using the mechanisms provided below. In your request, please make clear what information you would like to have changed, whether you would like to have your personal information suppressed from our database, or if you have other questions about your personal information. We will try to comply with your request as soon as reasonably practicable.

You may request that we not share your personal information on a going-forward basis with our subsidiaries and affiliated education companies or our business partners for their direct marketing purposes by: sending an email to [privacy@amplify.com](mailto:privacy@amplify.com) with “Amplify: Disclosure Opt-out" in the subject line and your full name, email address, and postal address in the body of the email. We will try to comply with your request(s) as soon as reasonably practicable.

7\. Data retention

We will retain your information for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy unless a longer retention period is required or allowed by law.

Remember that even after you cancel your account, copies of some information from your account may remain viewable in some circumstances – where, for example, you have shared information with Other Services. We may also retain backup information related to your account on our servers for some time after cancelation for fraud detection or to comply with applicable law or our internal security policies. Because of the nature of caching technology, your account may not be instantly inaccessible to others, and there may be a delay in the removal of the content from elsewhere on the Internet and from search engines.

8\. Sensitive information

We ask that you not send us, and you not disclose, any sensitive personal information (e.g., social security numbers, information related to racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religion or other beliefs, health, criminal background or trade union membership) on or through the Site or otherwise.
