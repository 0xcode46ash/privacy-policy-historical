**Privacy Policy**

Your privacy is critically important to us.

Clipmarks, LLC (” **Clipmarks** “) operates several websites including [amplify.com](http://www.amplify.com/), and [clipmarks.com](http://www.clipmarks.com/). It is Clipmarks’ policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our websites. ****

**Website Visitors**

Like most website operators, Clipmarks collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Clipmarks’ purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Clipmark’s visitors use its website. From time to time, Clipmarks may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.

Clipmarks also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. Clipmarks does not use such information to identify its visitors, however, and does not disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information, as described below. ****

**Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information**

Certain visitors to Clipmarks’s websites choose to interact with Clipmarks in ways that require Clipmarks to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Clipmarks gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for a Cliplog (Clog) at [Amplify.com](http://www.amplify.com/) to provide their full name as well as a user photo, username and email address. You may also provide additional personal information in your user profile. This information may be displayed on the web Clipmarks websites in conjunction with your activity on the websites. Clipmarks does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities. Your email address may be used to send you notifications about activity the website. You can control these notifications on the Email Notifications page in the Settings menu. ****

**Aggregated Statistics**

Clipmarks may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. For instance, Clipmarks may monitor the most popular Clogs on the Amplify.com site or use spam screened by the Akismet comment spam prevention service to help identify spam. Clipmarks may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, Clipmarks does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. ****

**Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information**

Clipmarks discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Clipmarks’s behalf or to provide services available at Clipmarks’s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Clipmarks’s websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Clipmarks will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Clipmarks discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only when required to do so by law, or when Clipmarks believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Clipmarks, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of a Clipmarks website and have supplied your email address, Clipmarks may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with Clipmarks and our products. We expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Clipmarks takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information. ****
