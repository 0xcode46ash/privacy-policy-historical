This Privacy Policy explains how information about you is collected, used, disclosed and otherwise processed by Fluke Corporation (and/or an affiliate or subsidiary) acting as a data controller for the purpose of applicable data protection law (collectively, "we", “our” or "us").

This Privacy Policy applies to information we collect about you when you use our websites, our mobile applications and other online products and services provided by us (collectively, the "Services"), or when you otherwise interact with us. Some of this information may be personal information as it may be information about you.

**Where we need your consent to the collection, use, disclosure, transfer or other processing of your personal information (as described in this Privacy Policy), you provide such consent by accessing and using the Services.

We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make changes, we will notify you by revising the "Last Updated" date at the top of this Privacy Policy and, in some cases, we may provide you with additional notice (such as by adding a statement to our homepage or by sending you a notification). We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy whenever you access the Services to stay informed about our information handling practices and the ways you can help protect your privacy. Your continued use of the Services after such changes have been notified will constitute your consent to those changes.
