  3. Personal information that we collect 

Visitors to our site and services will have multiple manners of interactivity with us. Depending upon your level of interaction, we will collect different information about you. The type of information collected is as follows:

    1. Members - Members are those users who subscribe to our services. If you choose to become a member we will ask you to provide your name, your address, your phone number, your fax number, your credit card information, your picture, a video, your date of birth, gender, and anything we ask for in your online profile. We also collect user mobile telephone number which we plan to market to in the near future. We will also collect all necessary billing information, and any other information that you voluntarily place in your online profile.
    2. Browsers - Browsers are visitors to the site who never enter into any active data collection pages. Any information gathered from Browsers is also gathered from Posters, Players, and Members. This information is restricted to cookies, IP Addresses, Referral URLs, and other passive information gathering devices.
  4. How we collect information from you 
    1. Passive Collection – We use cookies to collect information about you in order to enhance your experience on the site. The information collected in our cookies includes, but is not limited to, your user IP address, your browser, and your geographic location.
    2. Active Collection – we collect information from you when you complete registration forms to sign up for your membership on our Site.
  5. How we use your information 
    1. The primary use for your information is to provide you with services you have requested and/or paid for. We also use your information to deliver customized services to you. Non-personal and aggregate information, such as that collected passively is used in order to customize our marketing efforts or to customize the use of our site for an aggregate group of customers. We additionally will use your personal information of users whose membership has expired or have been cancelled in order to market our services to these individuals in the future.
    2. We generally will use your information for the purposes for which you specifically provide it, for example, to ensure payment for subscription services. We also use your information for market research purposes – in order to increase your (and other users’) experience according to tracked interests, to analyze and target potential new markets, and for other marketing purposes.
    3. We also use your information for the obvious purpose of providing your user profile to all of our other users and browsers. When you create a profile, you should consider all of the information on the profile to be public information, accessible by anyone, unless otherwise stated. Confidential information in your profile cannot be viewed by others or the public. Confidential information includes your name, address, and billing information. Nevertheless, your profile information, pictures, and videos as well as your city, state, and country will all be public information. Although your personally identifying information will not be made public, you should understand that there is a possibility that you may be identified through information you provide on your profile. For example, you may be visually recognized by someone who sees your picture or your description may be adequately detailed that someone browsing the site would be able to tell that the person is you. Accordingly, you understand that using this site places you in control of all of the information displayed on your profile, and you take full responsibility for any consequences for whatever information you choose to publish. Additionally, as we operate a network of websites, we reserve the right to post your profile on all of the network sites that we maintain, and we reserve the right to sell all of your information if we sell off one or more of our sites. For example, by joining AmateurMatch you accept that your profile may be duplicated and placed on datematch.com. and if we sell datematch.com, your profile may be part and parcel of that sale.
  6. Special Cases. 

It is our policy not to use or share the personal information about Visitors or Members in ways unrelated to those described in this Policy without also providing you an opportunity to opt out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses. However, we may disclose personal information about Visitors or Members, or information regarding your use of the Services or Web sites accessible through our Services, for any reason if, in our sole discretion, we believe that it is reasonable to do so, including:

    1. To satisfy any laws, such as the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, regulations, or governmental, or legal requests for such information;
    2. To disclose information that is necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal action against someone who may be violating our Acceptable Use Policy or other user policies;
    3. To operate our Services properly;
    4. To protect ourselves, our Members, and the general public. We will always cooperate with law enforcement authorities. We specifically reserve the right to disclose any and all information to law enforcement in the event that a crime is committed, is suspected, or if we are compelled to do so by lawful criminal, civil, or administrative process, discovery requests, subpoenas, court orders, writs, or reasonable request of authorities or persons with the reasonable power to obtain such process.
    5. We will only cooperate with private-party litigants, and others seeking information about our end users to the extent required by applicable law. Examples of such cooperation include lawful criminal, civil, or administrative process, discovery requests, subpoenas, court orders, writs, or reasonable request of authorities or persons with the reasonable power to obtain such process.
    6. Investigative reporters or journalists will never be cooperated with regarding your personal information.
    7. If we have reason to believe that the user is not the owner of a credit card, even if the credit card use is authorized, we will provide information about you to the credit card holder. We will absolutely provide your information to the credit card holder if we believe that fraud is a possibility. However, we do not require that there be fraud, as it is our policy that the credit card holder always has an absolute right to access any and all of your personal information.
    8. Anyone who violates our Anti-Spam Policy, shall have their personal information made public. If there is any investigation on any unlawful spamming, or any use of bulk e-mail in order to promote your user profile, or any use of bulk e-mail in any manner that leads back to our site, or any one of our sites, we will cooperate with any and all parties completely and freely in order to see that your bulk e-mail activities stop.
  7. Transmittals from Us 

We may send you periodic announcements including the details of our existing and new programs. You may opt out of these announcements by contacting support@amateurmatch.com or by clicking the opt-out link at the bottom of these emails. If you opt out of these marketing emails, you may still receive system notices and other information that is specifically related to your account.

If you provide your information to us, use the Site, or subscribe to any of our services, you will have created a commercial relationship with us. In having done so, you understand that even unsolicited commercial email sent from us or our affiliates is not SPAM as that term is defined under the law.

  8. Public Forums, Member Directories, and Internal Messaging: 
    1. Member Directories – Any information provided in a user profile, member directory, or other related service should be considered to be public information. We do not, cannot, and will not act to maintain the privacy of any information that you provide in any such forum or medium.
    2. Internal Messaging – We provide an internal messaging system for use between members of our Site. Any information that you send via this internal messaging system is not secure, and is not considered to be private information. You should use caution when sending any personal information over the internal messaging system, and you should not transmit any information that you would not wish to see disclosed to the general public.
  9. Our Commitment to Data Security. 

We take measures, including data encryption, to protect the transmission of all sensitive end-user information. We make every effort to ensure the integrity and security of our network and systems. Nevertheless, we cannot guarantee that our security measures will prevent third-party ‘hackers’ from illegally obtaining this information. We take all reasonable measures to prevent such breaches of security, but given the resourcefulness of cyber-criminals we are unable to guarantee that our security is 100% breach-proof. You assume the risk of such breaches to the extent that they occur despite our reasonable security measures.

  10. How to Access or Modify Your Information. 

We offer our Members the opportunity to access or modify information provided during registration. To access or modify such information, contact our Customer Service Department at [support@amateurmatch.com](mailto:support@amateurmatch.com).
