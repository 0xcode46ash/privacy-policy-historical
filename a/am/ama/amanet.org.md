# Privacy Policy

| 

Your privacy on the Internet is important to American Management Association International ("AMA"). This privacy statement discloses AMA’s privacy practices for “Personally Identifiable Information” (that is, information that identifies you or a third party) that is transmitted electronically to AMA via this Website, and addresses the following items:

  * How AMA uses Personally Identifiable Information. 
  * With whom AMA shares Personally Identifiable Information. 
  * The choices available to you, as a Website visitor, regarding collection, use and sharing of Personally Identifiable Information.
  * The security procedures that AMA has in place to protect the loss, misuse or alteration of Personally Identifiable Information under its control. 



**Collection and Use**  
AMA does not collect any Personally Identifiable Information from visitors except when they expressly volunteer the information. 

The instances where Personally Identifiable Information is collected on this site include the times a visitor 

  * Registers for a seminar, becomes a Member, purchases or downloads an AMA product or service. 
  * Requests information (electronically or via US Mail) about AMA’s products and services, subscribes to newsletters, or enters a promotional contest. 
  * Uses various tools to select AMA products and services that are suitable for the Website visitor. 
  * Requests contact with an AMA sales representative. 
  * Provides AMA with feedback about AMA products and services or the visitor’s Website experience. 



AMA is the sole owner of the information collected on this Website and will not sell, share, or rent Personally Identifiable Information other than as disclosed below in this statement. AMA does not sell, share with or rent to others e-mail addresses solely for the purpose of third party marketing, but may include third party advertisements within e-mails. Among other things, this Personally Identifiable Information is used to respond to visitor requests and inquiries, and to communicate timely information and special offers to visitors. A visitor can choose not to receive such information by e-mailing [customerservice@amanet.org](mailto:customerservice@amanet.org) or by calling AMA Customer Service at 1-800-262-9699. If a visitor registers for a seminar or pays for products and services using a credit card, contact information (such as name and shipping address) and financial information (credit card number, expiration date) is required. This information is used for billing purposes and to fill orders. If we have trouble processing an order, this contact information is used to get in touch with the visitor.

Personally Identifiable Information is also collected when a visitor applies for a position with AMA or a program sponsored by AMA. In these cases, Personally Identifiable Information is used only for the purpose of processing and evaluating the application. 

**Tell-a-Friend**  
AMA respects the privacy of your friends and co-workers. AMA will not keep or maintain names or e-mail addresses when you use our Tell-a-Friend function. The Tell-a-Friend function is solely to provide your friends and co-workers with the information you have requested we pass along to them.

**Sharing Personally Identifiable Information**  
AMA shares Personally Identifiable Information collected electronically through its Website in the following ways:

  * AMA or AMA partners may use an outside shipping company to ship orders, and/or a credit card processing company to bill for goods and services purchased through the AMA Website and AMA will share Personally Identifiable Information with those entities. 
  * From time to time, AMA works with business partners and sponsors to provide specific services, such as jointly developed and marketed products and services. When the visitor signs up for such services, we will share Personally Identifiable Information necessary for the partner/sponsor to provide these services. 
  * AMA does provide certain of its business partners with its postal mailing address list on a rental basis. In the event the customer wishes to be excluded from receiving third party mailings he/she should e-mail [customerservice@amanet.org](mailto:customerservice@amanet.org) or call AMA Customer Service at 1-800-262-9699. 
  * E-mailings of AMA newsletters and other materials are processed both in-house and by outsourced service companies. On occasion, where AMA contracts with a service provider, it may request that the provider collect and/or provide information directly from our customers on our behalf. In all situations, AMA restricts how its suppliers and other service providers may access, use and disclose Personally Identifiable Information. AMA does not permit these suppliers and other service providers to sell Personally Identifiable Information to third parties. If information is received through AMA or through a third party supplier which is not desired, the customer should request to be removed from the active mailing list by e-mailing [customerservice@amanet.org](mailto:customerservice@amanet.org) or by calling AMA Customer Service at 1-800-262-9699. 
  * AMA reserves the right to use Personally Identifiable Information in order to investigate any claim or suspicion that there may have been a violation of the Terms and Conditions governing this site, to assist with law enforcement investigations, or as otherwise required by law.



AMA may transfer Personally Identifiable Information to a third party in the event of a sale of stock, merger or consolidation or other transfer of all or a portion of the assets of AMA whether voluntarily or by operation of law.
