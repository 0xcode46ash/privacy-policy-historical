# Privacy Policy

Your privacy on the Internet is important to American Management Association International (“AMA”). This privacy statement discloses AMA’s privacy practices for “Personally Identifiable Information” (that is, information that identifies you or a third party) that is transmitted electronically to AMA via this Website, and addresses the following items:

  * How AMA uses Personally Identifiable Information. 
  * With whom AMA shares Personally Identifiable Information. 
  * The choices available to you, as a Website visitor, regarding collection, use and sharing of Personally Identifiable Information.
  * The security procedures that AMA has in place to protect the loss, misuse or alteration of Personally Identifiable Information under its control. 



**Collection and Use**  
AMA does not collect any Personally Identifiable Information from you except when you expressly volunteer the information. This includes when you: 

  * Register for a seminar, become a Member, purchase or download an AMA product or service.
  * Request information (electronically or via US Mail) about AMA's products and services, subscribe to newsletters, or enter a promotional contest. 
  * Use various tools to select AMA products and services that are suitable for your Website visit. 
  * Request contact with an AMA sales representative. 
  * Provide AMA with feedback about AMA products and services or your Website experience. 



AMA is the sole owner of the information collected on this Website and will not sell, share, or rent Personally Identifiable Information other than as disclosed below in this statement. AMA does not sell, share with or rent to others e-mail addresses solely for the purpose of third party marketing, but may include third party advertisements within e-mails. Among other things, this Personally Identifiable Information is used to respond to your requests and inquiries, and to communicate timely information and special offers. You can choose not to receive such information by e-mailing [customerservice@amanet.org ](mailto:customerservice@amanet.org) or by calling AMA Customer Service at 1-800-262-9699. If you register for a seminar or pay for products and services using a credit card, contact information (such as your name and shipping address) and financial information (credit card number, expiration date) is required. This information is used for billing purposes and to fill orders. If we have trouble processing an order, this contact information is used to get in touch with you. 

Personally Identifiable Information is also collected when you apply for a position with AMA or a program sponsored by AMA. In these cases, Personally Identifiable Information is used only for the purpose of processing and evaluating the application. 

The information you give us and information about your order may be combined with other personally identifiable information (such as demographic information and past purchase history) available from our records and other sources. This information will be used to make our future marketing efforts more efficient.

**Tell-a-Friend**  
AMA respects the privacy of your friends and co-workers. AMA will not keep or maintain names or e-mail addresses when you use our Tell-a-Friend function. The Tell-a-Friend function is solely to provide your friends and co-workers with the information you have requested we pass along to them.

**Sharing Personally Identifiable Information**  
AMA shares Personally Identifiable Information collected electronically through its Website in the following ways:

  * AMA or AMA partners may use an outside shipping company to ship orders, and/or a credit card processing company to bill for goods and services purchased through the AMA Website, and AMA will share Personally Identifiable Information with those entities. 
  * From time to time, AMA works with business partners and sponsors to provide specific services, such as jointly developed and marketed products and services. When you sign up for such services, we will share Personally Identifiable Information necessary for the partner/sponsor to provide these services. 
  * AMA does provide certain firms with its postal mailing address list on a rental basis. If you wish to be excluded from receiving third party mailings, please e-mail [customerservice@amanet.org](mailto:customerservice@amanet.org) or call AMA Customer Service at 1-800-262-9699. ****
  * In addition, we may share information about your order with some of these firms so that they can more easily identify offers that may interest you. If you prefer that we do not share your order information, please email us at [optout@amanet.org](mailto:optout@amanet.org).
  * E-mailings of AMA newsletters and other materials are processed both in-house and by outsourced service companies. On occasion, where AMA contracts with a service provider, it may request that the provider collect and/or provide information directly from our customers on our behalf. In all situations, AMA restricts how its suppliers and other service providers may access, use and disclose Personally Identifiable Information. AMA does not permit these suppliers and other service providers to sell Personally Identifiable Information to third parties. If you receive information through AMA or through a third party supplier that you prefer not to receive, you should request to be removed from the active mailing list by e-mailing [customerservice@amanet.org](mailto:customerservice@amanet.org) or by calling AMA Customer Service at 1-800-262-9699. 
  * AMA reserves the right to use Personally Identifiable Information in order to investigate any claim or suspicion that there may have been a violation of the Terms and Conditions governing this site, to assist with law enforcement investigations, or as otherwise required by law.



AMA may transfer Personally Identifiable Information to a third party in the event of a sale of stock, merger or consolidation, or other transfer of all or a portion of the assets of AMA, whether voluntarily or by operation of law.
