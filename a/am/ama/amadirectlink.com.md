# AMA Privacy Policy

This document was last updated on September 3, 2008

The American Motorcyclist Association (AMA) understands how valuable privacy is to our members and site visitors. This Privacy Policy explains how the AMA collects and uses personal information and how you can make your privacy preferences known.

### **Which sites are covered by this privacy policy?**

This privacy policy applies to the following AMA sites:

  * AmericanMotorcyclist (including www.AmericanMotorcyclist.com, www.AMADirectlink.com, www.ama-cycle.org and home.ama-cycle.org)
  * AMA Members Only



### **What personal information do we collect?**

**Accessing content on AmericanMotorcyclist  
**You can access our Web site’s homepage and browse all of our content, except that designated as “members-only,” without disclosing personal information. 

We collect only non-personal information such as your computer’s IP address, your domain name, your operating system and your browser. This information is used to evaluate how you and other visitors use the AMA Web site and is not used to track your name, e-mail address or other personal data. 

**AMA Members Area content  
**To access members-only content, you must first be an AMA member. AMA members must provide their AMA number, ZIP code and e-mail address to create a username and password, which is then used to access content in the Members Area. 

**Personal information we collect  
**If you choose to join the AMA online, we will ask for personal information, including your name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, gender, birth date and riding preferences. This information is used for correspondence related to your membership and, if you instruct us to, may be used to contact you regarding certain other benefits or products of the AMA, AMA Pro Racing and the Motorcycle Hall of Fame Museum, and AMA-endorsed programs. 

We may also ask for personal information when you participate in other activities on the AMA Web site, including online shopping and our e-mail newsletter, AMA Extra. 

**Children’s privacy**  
The AMA realizes that children may visit and use the AMA Web site. Therefore, we encourage parents, guardians and teachers to monitor children’s use of the Internet. Children should always get permission from their parents before sending any personal information about themselves over the Internet, to us or anyone else.

**Use of cookies**  
We use cookies to recognize you and your access privileges for our members-only content, to record votes for our online polls and to track membership sales from our affiliates. We also use cookies to collect anonymous traffic data to evaluate how you and other visitors use the AMA Web site. We do not use cookies to collect personal information.

You can set your browser so that it will not accept cookies. Doing so, however, will prohibit you from accessing certain features of the Web site, including content in the Members Area. You can use your browser’s help feature to learn more about disabling cookies.

**Third-party advertising  
**We do not partner with or have special relationships with any ad server companies such as DoubleClick.

**Linked sites  
**The AMA is not responsible for the content or privacy policies of Web sites to which it may link.

**Non-US customer information  
**The AMA’s Web sites are located in the United States and the AMA collects, stores and processes your personal information in the United States. The United States may not offer a level of privacy protection for your personal information as great as is offered in the country in which you live. 

### How do we use your personal information?

Our primary purpose in using personal information we collect is to provide service for your AMA membership and provide you with products and services you request, such as gift shop purchases, e-mail newsletters, and access to members-only content on our Web site.
