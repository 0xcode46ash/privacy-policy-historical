# Amazon.com.au Help: Amazon.com.au Privacy Notice

##  **What Personal Information About Customers Does Amazon Gather?**

The information we learn from customers helps us personalize and continually improve your Amazon experience. We use the information to handle orders, deliver products and services, process payments, communicate with you about orders, products, services, for marketing communications, to update our records and generally maintain your accounts with us, display content such as wish lists and customer reviews and to recommend merchandise and services that might be of interest to you. We also use this information to improve our services, store, websites and applications (together "sites"), prevent or detect fraud or abuses of our sites and enable third parties to carry out technical, logistical or other functions on our behalf.

Here are the types of information we gather.

  


  1. **Information You Give Us:** We receive and store any information you enter on our sites or give us in any other way. Click here to see examples of what we collect. You can choose not to provide certain information, but then you might not be able to take advantage of many of our features. We use the information that you provide for such purposes as responding to your requests, customizing future shopping for you, improving our stores, and communicating with you.
  2. **Automatic Information:** We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with us. For example, like many websites , we use "cookies," and we obtain certain types of information when your browser accesses sites or advertisements and other content served by or on behalf of Amazon on other websites. Click here to see examples of the information we receive.
  3. **Mobile:** When you download or use [apps from Amazon Appstore](https://www.amazon.com.au/gp/help/customer/display.html/ref=hp_bc_nav?ie=UTF8&nodeId=201357410), we may receive information about your location and your mobile device, including a unique identifier for your device. We may use this information to provide you with location-based services, such as advertising, search results, and other personalized content. Most mobile devices allow you to turn off location services. For more information about how to do this, [click here](https://www.amazon.com.au/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=201589080).
  4. **E-mail Communications:** To help us make e-mails more useful and interesting, we often receive a confirmation when you open e-mails from Amazon if your device supports such capabilities. We also compare our customer list to lists received from other companies in an effort to avoid sending unnecessary messages to our customers.
  5. **Information from Other Sources:** We might receive information about you from other sources and add it to our account information. Click here to see examples of the information we receive.
