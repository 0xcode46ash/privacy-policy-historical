# Privacy | Applied Materials

Applied Materials, Inc., including its subsidiaries (“Applied Materials”), respects the privacy of our online visitors. This policy describes our procedures for collecting, using and disclosing information we collect from you when you visit [www.appliedmaterials.com](http://www.appliedmaterials.com/) and other Applied Materials Websites accessible globally through this site (collectively, “Website”). 

## Information We Collect

We collect information from and about our Website users, both directly when you provide it and automatically while you visit the Website, as follows: 

    1. __Personal Information You Provide__. “Personal information” is information that can be used to specifically identify or contact you, such as your name, email or physical address, and telephone number. We do not automatically collect personal information, although we may request, or provide an opportunity to submit, such information in connection with an online feature or service. For instance, we may ask customers, suppliers and job applicants for information necessary to verify your eligibility to use a Website service and to facilitate dealings or transactions. While you are under no obligation to provide us with personal information, you should understand that we will not be able to process your communications with us or render certain services that we offer online without this information.
    2. __Information Collected Automatically__. As you navigate through and interact with the Website, we collect certain information that is automatically recorded from your computer, smartphone or other electronic device (“device”) you use to visit the site. The information we collect automatically is statistical data and does not include personal information. It may include information about your equipment and browsing actions, such as your device’s Internet Protocol (IP) address, operating system, browser type, web pages viewed immediately before and after visiting our Website, information you search for on our Website, and other technical data that helps us improve our site and deliver better service. We use browser “cookies” to collect information, which are very small data files transferred to your device when you direct your browser to our Website. These include “session cookies” that operate only while you are visiting our Website and then are deleted, which enable certain Website features and help us understand how visitors interact with the Website. We may also use “persistent cookies” that stay on your device between browsing sessions for a period of time and enable our Website to remember you when you return. 

You can adjust the settings on your internet browser to control cookies. In addition, Applied Materials honors "do-not-track" technology, which enables you to signal your preference concerning the automatic collection of your information. Note that if you disable or refuse cookies, some parts of our Website may be inaccessible or not function properly. 




## How We Use Information

    1. __Use of Personal Information (for Job Applicant Data, please see section B(2) below)__. We use the personal information you submit on the Website to carry out your requests, respond to your inquiries, or otherwise serve you in ways naturally associated with the circumstances under which you provided the information. We do not use your personal information for Applied Materials’ marketing purposes unless you affirmatively agree or opt-in to such usage. Marketing may include sending you communications about our products and services or other communications targeted to your interests. If you do not wish us to use your email address or other contact information for our direct marketing purposes, do not select the opt-in option (if any) in the online form on which we collect your data. If you initially opt-in but change your mind, you can opt-out by: (i) replying to a promotional email we have sent and indicating your preference to unsubscribe; or (ii) sending us an email stating your request to [Privacy_Issues@amat.com](mailto:Privacy_Issues@amat.com). Further details regarding use of personal information provided through our Website Career page are described immediately below.
    2. __Use of Job Applicant Data__. Applied Materials will only use personal information provided by job applicants through the Career page of our Website for: (i) recruitment purposes in the United States or other countries where we operate; (ii) other employment-related purposes (such as the administration of benefits) in the event you are offered a job or become employed by Applied Materials; and (iii) reporting purposes as required by law. Your information may be shared with third parties acting on Applied Materials’ behalf who are under contract to treat the information confidentially and in accordance with our data privacy protections. For Website users outside the United States, note that information you provide may be stored in our international resume database located in the United States for so long as allowed by law. Your information may be viewable by us or third parties acting on our behalf at locations outside the United States, including countries that may not protect data privacy to the same extent as your country of residence. By submitting your application and related information, you are consenting to our use, export, sharing and retention of your information as described in this policy. Applied will not be able to process your job application or other requests if it cannot collect, process or use your personal information as described above. You should not provide any personal information to Applied if you disagree with the above statement regarding our collection, processing or use of the information.
    3. __Use of Automatically-Collected Information and Analytics.__ We use non-personal information we collect automatically through logging and cookie technologies to facilitate your use of our Website, to analyze usage by visitors, and to improve the Website experience and deliver better service. For example, we may use cookies when you register for one of our web-based services to store information that enables our Website to remember you on a return visit. These technologies also help us better understand which areas of the Website are of interest to visitors. 



## Information Sharing and Disclosure

Applied Materials, Inc. may disclose or share your information with our corporate subsidiaries worldwide that are also bound by this Privacy Policy. We will not share your information with any third party for that party’s marketing purposes, although we may also disclose your information to certain third parties as described below.

    1. __Service Providers and Agents__. We may share information with outside service providers or agents who are authorized to use the information only on Applied Materials’ behalf, such as to provide services or products you have requested, perform billing and collection, or help us manage and analyze data and improve the Website. These parties may access your information only for purposes of performing these tasks, under obligations similar to those in this privacy policy and in accordance with our data privacy protections.
    2. __Legal Compliance or Enforcement__. We may disclose your information to third parties when we believe disclosure is necessary to: (i) comply with a law, regulation or compulsory legal process, including a law enforcement, regulatory or court-authorized request; (ii) protect the rights, property or safety of Applied Materials or other persons or entities; or (iii) enforce our Website Terms of Use available at [legal information](https://web.archive.org/terms-of-use).
    3. __Business Transfers__. If Applied Materials is involved in a merger, acquisition, business combination, reorganization or other transfer of some or all of the company’s business, your information may be transferred to the buyer or other successor to Applied Materials.
