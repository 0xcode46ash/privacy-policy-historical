# Privacy Policy | A Mighty River

A Mighty River is committed to protecting the privacy of our users. In addition to providing our users numerous privacy features, A Mighty River has created this Privacy Statement in order to demonstrate in writing our firm commitment to privacy.

## Use of Personal Information

A Mighty River collects personal information from users on a voluntary basis. This information allows us to provide users with private and secure areas to post and modify their original content on our site. If you give us permission, we may also use that information to make you aware of additional products and services of A Mighty River or trusted third parties with whom we have alliances which may be of interest to you, or to contact you regarding site changes. A Mighty River may also provide such information to subsidiaries, affiliates and other trusted third parties with whom we have alliances in connection with providing products or services that you have requested or otherwise with your permission, subject to the terms of this Privacy Policy.

We do not display personal information without our users' permission. All users should be aware, however, that when they voluntarily display or distribute personal information (such as their e-mail address), that information can be collected and used by others. This may result in unsolicited messages from or other uses by third parties, for which A Mighty River is not responsible. 

A Mighty River also collects, or logs, certain other information that cannot identify you personally when you visit our Web site. This information includes your Internet Protocol (“IP”) address and your domain name. An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer by the ISP computer through which you access the web and a domain name is the name of the ISP computer itself through which you access the web.

A Mighty River logs these IP addresses and domain names and aggregates them for system administration and to monitor the use of our site. We use the aggregated information to measure the number of visits to our site, the average time spent on our site, the number of pages viewed, and various other site use statistics. This monitoring helps us evaluate how our Web site is used and continuously improve the content we provide.

A Mighty River also may disclose personal information about you, without notice: (i) in response to requests from local, state or federal law enforcement officials; (ii) if requested by any judicial, administrative or similar proceeding or order, such as a subpoena; or (iii) if otherwise required by law.

It may be necessary to contact affiliates, business partners or other third parties directly in order to cease receiving communications from those third parties.

Deleting Personal Information - A Mighty River gives users the ability to remove their information from our database. However, A Mighty River may retain archival copies of the information that is not accessible online and will not be used for commercial purposes.

Changes/Modifications - A Mighty River gives users the continuous ability to change and modify information previously provided by accessing and updating their personal information through their account with A Mighty River.

You agree that A Mighty River, its subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, agents, co-branders or other partners, and employees have no liability, obligation or responsibility for any such interaction, purchase or promotion between you and any such third party.
