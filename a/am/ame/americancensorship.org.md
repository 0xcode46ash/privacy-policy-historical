## Privacy Policy

Fight for the Future is committed to protecting your privacy. If you sign onto one of our various mailing lists, petitions, or use our contact tools, we retain the information you provided to primarily manage our mailing lists, and secondarily transmit only the information that is required to public officials in communications with them. We may share your contact information with cooperating organizations or service providers in order to facilitate email delivery, list management, and for other purposes. We do not sell our email list.

For petitions, open letters, or similar public communications that you've signed or completed, we treat your name, city, state, and comments as public information. We will not make your street address publicly available, but we may transmit it to public officials as part of a petition or open letter.

If any amendments are made to this privacy policy, we will make note of it here.

Using our voter registration tool requires you submit personal information through a third-party application (e.g. TurboVote) to either local or state election officials. In most states, said information becomes a matter of public record. While The Center for Rights will not keep any of the information submitted for the purpose of voter registration to local or state officials from our tools (except the information associated with aforementioned mailing list management), it will, in some states, be made available for inspection and use by candidates for public office.

We may also disclose a user's information if it is requested by a law enforcement agency, but only if shown the legally required documents, such as a subpoena, court order, or other legal processes.
