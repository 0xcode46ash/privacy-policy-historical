**Security**

When you send confidential personal account data to us on an American Express website, we require that a "secure session" first be established using Secure Socket Layer (SSL), or Secure Electronic Transaction (SET) protocol when that is fully available. For further information about SSL, SET and the safety and confidentiality of personal data transmissions over the Internet, please read our [Security Q&A.](https://web.archive.org/cust_serv/docs/cs_security.shtml)

**Information Collection**

When you **browse** any American Express website, you do so anonymously. Personal information -- including your E-mail address -- is _not_ collected. Some of our websites, however, may request that you **voluntarily** supply us with personal information, including your E-mail address and account number (if you are an American Express Cardmember or InvestDirect user), for purposes such as correspondence, site registration, checking your bill or investments online, making a purchase, or participating in online surveys. 

Like many other commercial websites, the American Express website may utilize a standard technology called a "cookie" to collect information about how our site is used. Please read [About Cookies](https://web.archive.org/corp/consumerinfo/privacy/about_cookies.shtml) for more information. 

**Information Use**

If you provide us with your E-mail address, or have done so in the past, we may upon occasion send you E-mail offers. We may use information you have given us to, for example, provide a service, ensure proper billing, measure consumer interest in our various services and inform you about products and services. These offers may be based on information you provided in your initial transaction with us, in surveys, from information that may indicate purchasing preferences and lifestyle, as well as information available from external sources, such as census bureau data. Primarily, these E-mail offers will come from American Express. We may also, upon occasion, share E-mail addresses with certain establishments that accept the American Express Card, or with other well-established companies so that they can send you product and service offers that may be of interest. 

All offers are carefully developed to ensure that they meet our standards. Our goal is to target offers to people who we believe will find them of value. The lists used to send you product and service offers are developed and managed under strict conditions designed to safeguard the security and privacy of customer personal information. For an illustration of the types of offers we may provide with our business partners exclusively to American Express Cardmembers, please view [American Express Special Offers](http://www6.americanexpress.com/specialoffers/). 

Please note that our free E-mail service, **AmExMail** , as well as our financial services websites, **American Express Financial Advisors** and **American Express Financial Direct** , _do not_ share E-mail addresses with any company outside of American Express. 

**Declining E-mail Offers**

American Express provides customers with an easy means to decline receiving E-mail offers. 

Although most customers tell us they appreciate receiving notice of these carefully designed opportunities, we recognize the importance of providing you with choices. At any time, you may request to discontinue receiving these offers from us by simply replying to the E-mail and informing us of your preferences. All E-mail offers that you receive from American Express will inform you of how to decline receiving further E-mail offers. Additionally, you may [set E-mail preferences](http://www6.americanexpress.com/Corp/Consumerinfo/Privacy/Default.asp) to notify us of your preferences regarding the type of E-mail offers you do not want to receive, and you may also review and change preferences you have previously set. 

**Children**

American Express does not knowingly solicit data from children, and we do not knowingly market to children. 

**Company Commitment to Privacy**

In keeping with our long-standing leadership in consumer privacy protection, American Express is actively involved with current industry initiatives to preserve individual privacy rights on the Internet and in all aspects of electronic commerce.
