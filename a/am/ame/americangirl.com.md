Editorial Information We Collect from Girls for American Girl

**

The Fun for Girls portion of Pleasant Company's American Girl Web site is directed toward girls ages 8 and up. Pleasant Company doesn't require visitors to share any personal information about themselves in order to enjoy our web site. That means you can visit our site without any need to register with us or provide personal information. In the Fun for Girls section, users may be asked to provide a first name, age, and state when submitting a response to one of our editorial departments: [Help From You](https://web.archive.org/ag/help/help.html), [You Said It](https://web.archive.org/ag/ysi/ysi.html), and [To Do Today](https://web.archive.org/ag/features/todotoday/index.html). This information is completely voluntary. When asked for a name, girls may use "screen names" (not a real name) if they wish to do so, to protect their privacy. An editor reviews all the responses received and deletes any personally identifiable information that may have been sent before posting a sampling of them on the Web site. When we post a girl's submission, we use only her first name, age, and state.

Pleasant Company may collect some information from your child under age 13 without your consent, but only in the following case:

  * If a child sends us a comment through [E-mail Us](https://web.archive.org/feedback/index.html) and includes an e-mail address for a response, we keep that e-mail address only long enough to respond to that question or comment. E-mail addresses collected through the Fun for Girls site are not posted, released, sold, or distributed to anyone outside of Pleasant Company. 



We strongly advise girls to always check with parents before submitting any personal information to this or any other Web site. Please see A Note to Parents.

Other Information We Collect

**

A "cookie" is a small file that we save on your computer's hard drive, which contains non-personal information. Our cookies help to give you faster access to pages you have already visited, allow you to personalize certain pages, and keep track of your progress. If you leave the site and then return, cookies will tell us what things you have already collected so that you do not have to start all over again. This technology is essential for games like [The American Girls Trivia Game](https://web.archive.org/cgi/collection/collection/agctrivia.cgi). We also use cookies to help us figure out how many people visit our sites, which of our web pages they stop at and how long they stay there. This information helps us figure out which of our web features is a smashing success and what areas might need improvement! For administrative purposes, we collect IP addresses, which is the automatic number assigned to your computer when you surf the Web. The IP address allows us to count total number of "hits" on our sites. However, your IP address is not connected to any personally identifiable or on-line contact information like a name and address, so you and your family remain anonymous. Pleasant Company does not sell or release any information gathered on our Web site to any third parties. All information gathered online will be used only by Pleasant Company for internal marketing analysis and to improve our products, services, and Web site. Terms for information collection within the E-store are governed by the [E-store Privacy Policy](http://www.americangirlstore.com/icmo/plsql/icm_privacy). Please read these before shopping at the E-store.

Thanks for reading our privacy statement. We hope you have a better understanding of the many activities offered on our Web site and the ways in which we really are committed to safeguarding online privacy. Remember, we may change our policy from time to time to conform to changing legal requirements or to better protect your information. When this happens we will notify you of the new policy by posting it on our site.
