# American Girl E-store Privacy Policy

Online Privacy Policy

Dear American girl,

Pleasant Company is committed to protecting your online privacy and the safety of all our Web site visitors. Our site consists of two main areas. The "Fun for Girls" section is primarily for girls, with games and activities that are educational and entertaining. The American Girl 

E-Store is primarily for our adult visitors over age 18 and provides opportunities to shop and order products online.

If you are under 18 years old, please read this message with your parents before you visit our site. Please ask questions about things you do not understand. If you are under age 13, you should get a parent's permission before submitting any information about yourself on this Web site or any other on the Internet. Please remember that this site and the servers that make this site available are located in the U.S. By using this site you agree to the transfer, collection, processing, and use of data by this site.

\- Your Friends at American Girl

A Note to Parents

While we make every effort to make your child's visit to our Web site safe and enjoyable, we encourage you to monitor your child's online use and to help us protect children's privacy by instructing them never to provide personal information on this site or any other without permission. Please read Pleasant Company's [Web-Surfing Tips](http://www.americangirl.com/tools/html/safesurf.html) for more information. We do not require a child to disclose more information than is reasonably necessary as a condition for participating in a contest, game, or other activity. Upon proper identification, parents may review the personal information we have collected about their child, request deletion, or refuse to allow further collection or use. Click here to print a copy of our [Parental Review Access Form](https://web.archive.org/parental_review.doc). Please note that our American Girl E-Store is intended for adults. Ordering requires use of a valid credit card and confirmation that the visitor is over 18. Pleasant Company adheres to the guidelines created by the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 and the guidelines of the Children's Advertising Review Unit of the Council of Better Business Bureaus, Inc. All Pleasant Company marketing efforts, including this Web site, are closely monitored to abide by these guidelines.

About Our Site

Pleasant Company's American Girl Web site includes information about our company and our products, opportunities to shop online, surveys, sweepstakes and contests, advertising, entertainment, games, and employment information, among other items of interest. Our site consists of two main areas:

[Fun for Girls](http://www.americangirl.com/homepage2.html): Offers online games, polls, features, advice, and activity ideas, plus company-sponsored event listings and a peek at American Girl Place in Chicago.

[E-Store](http://www.americangirlstore.com/): Offers an opportunity to order products online, subscribe to American Girl magazine or request a catalogue. **Please remember: you must be over 18 and have a valid credit card to order products online.** Fans under 18 may use the Wish List function. 

Information We Collect from Girls in the "Fun for Girls" Section

The "Fun for Girls" portion of Pleasant Company's American Girl Web site is directed toward girls ages 8 and up. Pleasant Company doesn't require visitors to share any personal information about themselves in order to enjoy our Web site. A girl can visit the americangirl.com site without ever registering or providing personal information. In the "Fun for Girls" section, users may be asked to provide a first name, age, and state when submitting a response to one of our editorial departments: [Help From You](http://www.americangirl.com/agmg/help/index.html), [You Said It](http://www.americangirl.com/agmg/ysi/index.html), and [To Do Today](http://www.americangirl.com/agmg/todotoday/index.html). This information is completely voluntary. When asked for a name, girls may use "screen names" (not a real name) in order to protect their privacy. Before any responses are posted, an editor reviews all the responses received and deletes any personally identifiable information. When we post a girl's e-mailed submission to one of these departments, we use only her first name, age, and state. We obtain parental consent to post pictures of girls in "In Her Own Words," "Fan Gallery," and similar sections. Pleasant Company may collect some information from a child under age 13 without parental consent, but only in the following case: If a child sends a comment to americangirl.com through the E-mail Us form and includes an e-mail address for a response, the AmericanGirl.com customer service staff will keep that e-mail address only long enough to respond to that specific question or comment. E-mail addresses collected through the "Fun for Girls" portion of the Web site are not posted, released, sold, or distributed to anyone outside of Pleasant Company.

We strongly advise girls to check--ALWAYS--with parents before submitting any personal information to this or any other Web site. Please see A Note to Parents.

Information We Collect Online in American Girl's E-store

The American Girl E-store offers the full line of American Girl products available for purchase online, including _American Girl_ magazine. Customers must be over age 18 with a valid credit card. Fans under age 18 can use the Wish List function while browsing the e-store but cannot make purchases. When a customer places an order or requests a catalogue online, we collect information needed to complete the transaction, including the customer's name, mailing address, products ordered, shipping addresses, and credit card information. We ask for this information so that we may fulfill the order or catalogue request. We use Secure Sockets Layer technology to protect credit card data during transmission, and adopt careful internal procedures to safeguard this information in our system. Once customers have successfully entered the required information, an account will be created and maintained for them in our database. Requesting a catalogue or promotional e-mail as part of a sweepstakes entry will also create a customer account. We occasionally share name and address information with carefully selected companies whose offers you may be interested in. However, customers' telephone number(s), e-mail address(es) or credit card information are never shared. You may instruct us not to use your information at any time.

As a convenience to customers, we do offer the option of registering certain information for future orders while completing an online order. When a customer chooses to register, we then capture his or her login name, password, name, mailing address, alternate ship-to addresses, and credit card information. When registered customers return to the site to place subsequent orders, they can identify themselves with login name and password. No customer is required to register this information.

If a customer includes a child's birth date and e-mail address, this information will only be used to help us provide products and services that meet customer needs.

To change the information we have in your account, specify how that information can be used, or instruct us not to use your information, you can access My Account online or call 1-800-845-0005 to speak with a Customer Service representative. Please allow up to three hours for your account information to be accessible after creating an account online.

Customers who have recently moved or are planning a move in the near future should let us know by filling out the online [Change of Address](https://web.archive.org/web/20030603211000id_/http%3A//www.americangirlstore.com/pls/ag/pc_qc.comment_page) form. For all mailing questions and changes, you may also call 1-800-845-0005.

Other Information We Collect

A "cookie" is a small file that is saved on a user's computer hard drive that contains no personal information. americangirl.com's cookies provide users with faster access to pages they have already visited, allow users to personalize certain pages, and keep track of a user's progress in a game. If a girl leaves the americangirl.com Web site, a cookie will "remember" what games she has already played so that she does not have to start all over again when she returns. This technology is used only on some of the games on the Web site, including [The American Girls Trivia Game](http://www.americangirl.com/agmg/todotoday/index.html), [Pedal Power!](http://www.americangirl.com/agcn/molly/game2_pedalpower/), and [Kit's Money Matters](http://www.americangirl.com/agcn/kit/game2_eggs/index.html).

Americangirl.com also uses cookies to help determine how many people visit the site, which Web pages are visited, and how long visitors stay there. This information helps us create a better Web site by revealing which AmericanGirl.com features are a success and identifying areas that might need improvement. Cookies also help us keep track of items in the shopping cart or wish list. For administrative purposes, each visitor's IP address is collected. An IP address is the automatic number assigned to each user's computer when that person surfs the Web. Certain Internet Service Providers, like America Online, may assign the same IP address to many users. The IP addresses collected are counted as the number of "hits" on the site. A user's IP address is not connected to any personally identifiable or online contact information like a name and address, so every user remains anonymous.

Pleasant Company does not sell or release any information gathered in the "Fun for Girls" section to any third parties. We do post some identifiable information such as photos in some areas (Fan Gallery and In Her Own Words), but only with parental consent. All information gathered online will be used only by Pleasant Company for internal marketing analyses and to improve products, services, and the Web site. Under special circumstances, we may give other companies access to our information database, but only when needed to allow them to provide database or server maintenance or security, to help us process and fulfill orders or requests, or provide other similar services to us. If we do provide access, we require those companies outside our family of companies to sign confidentiality agreements promising to keep secret any information they see.

If we believe that anyone's behavior on our sites may damage us, our sites, or anyone else, we may disclose the relevant personal information in order to prevent this harm. In that case, we might try to identify the user, contact him or her, and/or bring legal action against him or her. We may also disclose personal information if we believe that the disclosure is required by law, or in response to a legal request.

Thank you for reading our privacy statement. We are genuinely committed to safeguarding online privacy for both you and your children. We hope you have a better understanding of the many activities offered on our Web site. Remember, we may change our policy from time to time. When this happens, we will notify you of the new policy by posting it on our site.

If you have concerns about your child's use of our service, please contact us using our [feedback form](https://web.archive.org/pls/ag/pc_qc.comment_page). Your child's use of this site is also governed by our [Terms and Conditions](https://web.archive.org/web/20030603211000id_/http%3A//www.americangirlstore.com/pls/ag/icm_terms) statement. Please read it.
