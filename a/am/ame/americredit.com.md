### An Important Message Concerning Your Privacy

  
At AmeriCredit, we value our customers’ trust and confidence. This privacy policy outlines the safeguards we employ to protect your personal information and it explains how we collect and use that information.

### Our Privacy Policy 

This disclosure is our privacy policy. Your understanding of our information sharing practices is important to us. In this policy, we will tell you (among other things):

  * Information we collect about you;
  * With whom we might share any of that information, and why;
  * What you can do if you don’t want us to share certain information about you; and

We do not share information about you except as disclosed in this policy and as permitted by law. 

We, our and us mean **AmeriCredit Financial Services, Inc., and AmeriCredit Corp.** We are a company specializing in automobile finance with offices throughout the United States.

This policy applies to our consumer customers who have continuing relationships with us. You have a continuing relationship with us if, for example, you have a:

  * Is a former customer; or
  * Provides nonpublic personal information on our Web site.

Here are other terms we will use in this disclosure:

  * **"Information"** means "nonpublic personal information," which is a technical term that generally means: 
    1. Information that can identify you;
    2. That is not available publicly; and
    3. That we collect in connection with providing a financial product or service to you.
  * We will use the word "information" to mean "nonpublic personal information."
  * **"Affiliate"** is a company one of us owns, a company that owns one of us, or a company that is owned or controlled by a company that owns one of us.
  * **"Nonaffiliate"** includes a person who is not employed by one of us, or a company that is not an affiliate.
  * **"Opt-out"** means a choice you make to prevent us from sharing certain information about you with others.
  * **"Unsubscribe"** means a choice you make to prevent us from sending you specific electronic communications.

If you have a joint account with us, you should share this notice with the persons who share your account. They may not get a separate notice. Persons who share your account may obtain a copy of this notice by visiting our Web site at [www.americredit.com](http://www.americredit.com/) or contacting us at 1-888-249-2763.
