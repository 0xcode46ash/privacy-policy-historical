**What Happens When You Are Browsing?**

If you are not registered for any online service from American Express, you browse this Site anonymously. We do not collect personal information -- such as your name, address, phone number or e-mail address -- if you are only browsing this site. American Express does, however, use "cookies" to collect information about how our site is used. Information, such as the server your computer is logged onto, your browser type (for example, Netscape or Internet Explorer), and whether you responded to an American Express banner ad or e-mail is collected and tracked in aggregate and not linked to you personally. We use this information to measure response rates to banner ads and e-mail offers. If you would like to learn more about cookies, please read [About Cookies](https://web.archive.org/india/legal/privacy_cookies.shtml) for more information. 

**What Happens When You Give Information To Us?**

**Registration for Online Products and Services**

If you want to apply for or take advantage of our online products or services, we will need you to give us some personal information, including your e-mail address and account number. We only collect information about you, which we need to process your application, to service your accounts and other needs, to offer new products and services, and to satisfy legal requirements. We will also use this information for purposes such as correspondence, site registration, allowing you to check your statement or other account details online, to make a purchase, or to participate in online surveys etc. We will also share such information with our affiliates and other for the purposes described elsewhere in this Statement. 

**Quality of Information**

We use advanced technology, documented employee procedures and internal monitoring to help ensure that your personal information is accurate and up-to-date. In addition, we require high standards of quality from credit reporting agencies and others who provide us with information about prospective customers or other services.

Information Use  
  
| 

We use your information to process your application or to provide the products and services you have requested. 

**How We Can Customize Your Online Experience**

If you are a registered user of an American Express online service, we may now or at some time in the future combine information about your use of this Site and our online service with other online and offline information we have about you as an American Express customer as well as information lawfully available from other organizations. We will use this combined information to customize your online experience and present you with relevant online and offline offers and updates. We also use a "cookie" to enable our server to recognize you as a registered American Express online service user when you re-enter our site. If you would like to learn more about cookies, please read [About Cookies](https://web.archive.org/india/legal/privacy_cookies.shtml) for more information. 

**What Else Do We Do With Information We Obtain?**

We may also use your information to measure consumer interest in our services and inform you about other products and services. For example, if we obtain your email address we may use it to send you offers we think you might be interested in. These offers may be based on information you provided in your initial transaction with us, or in surveys, from information that may indicate purchasing preferences and lifestyle, as well as information lawfully available from other organizations. These e-mail offers come directly from American Express. 

When we send you e-mails, we may be able to identify information about your e-mail address, such as whether you can read graphic-rich html e-mails. If your e-mail address is html-enabled, we may choose to send you graphic-rich html e-mails.

Disclosure of Information Policies  
  
| 

**Do We Share Information About You?**

American Express has had a long-standing commitment to protecting personal information of our customers and prospective customers. This section explains how we share your personal information with others. 

**Other American Express Companies**

We may share information about you within the American Express Group of Companies so we can provide you with products and services you request and bring you information about other American Express products and services. This may involve providing your personal information to other American Express companies both inside and outside India, including the USA and Australia, for processing, servicing or marketing purposes. All American Express Companies comply with The [American Express Customer Privacy Principles](https://web.archive.org/india/legal/privacy_customerpp.shtml) and with security procedures which are similar to those described above in Security. 

**Companies Who Provide Services To Us**

In some cases we contract with other companies to perform services for us. Examples of this include processing applications, sending e-mail, processing orders, providing marketing support, deliveries, market research, debt collection agencies etc. We provide them only with such information about you as they need to perform their services, but we impose strict requirements of security and confidentiality on them in how they handle your personal information. Also they are not permitted to use information about you for any purpose except to perform the services we have asked them to provide. 

**Our Business Partners**

We may send you offers by e-mail or other direct marketing methods (i.e. mail, fax or phone) about products and services offered by our business partners. When we do this, we keep control over your information, which is not disclosed to our business partners unless you have expressly authorized us to do so or you take advantage of their offer. 

**IMPORTANT NOTE: Please note that we do not give your e-mail address to our business partners.**

Please keep in mind that if you take advantage of an offer from an American Express business partner and become their customer, they may independently wish to send offers to you. In this case, you will need to inform them separately if you do not wish to receive future offers from them. In all cases our goal is to deliver offers to people who we believe will find them of value. Our communications are developed and managed under strict conditions designed to safeguard the security and privacy of customer personal information. Click here if you wish to "Opt Out" of receiving offers by e-mail.

If an order of a court or government authority requires us to disclose information about you, we will do our best to notify you of this promptly, to give you an opportunity to exercise your legal rights.
