# Privacy Policy

### What information is collected?

It is our policy to collect and store only personal information that visitors knowingly provide for America Saves when contacting us. The information collected generally is limited to name, address, email address and personal savings information. The server of our Internet Service Provider collects information on visitors to our site. In order to better understand our audience, our web host provides us with aggregate information on the number of hits the site receives, the domains from which the site is accessed, the top 20 organizations/ISPs that are used to connect to this site and the top 20 referrers (the last page you were on before you connected to this site). To gauge what our visitors are interested in, we also look at the top 20 search words used in connecting to this site.

We have the capability to calculate which America Saves files have been accessed, the types of files, the size of the files requested, the status of those files (i.e. 404 not found, etc.) and a breakdown of the operating systems used to access the site, but we do not track such information and have no plans to do so.

### How does America Saves use data collected?

We do not sell, rent, share, or otherwise disclose personally identifiable information.

Server statistics collected in aggregate (and previously mentioned) are used to improve the content and navigability of the site.

### How can I contact America Saves?

If you have questions or concerns about this privacy policy, please contact us at [information@americasaves.org](mailto:information@americasaves.org).
