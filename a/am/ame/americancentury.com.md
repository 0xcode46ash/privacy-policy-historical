# Privacy Policy - American Century

## It's a Matter of Privacy - Yours

Trust is the foundation of any solid relationship. At American Century Investments®, trust takes on even greater importance because you are entrusting your money to our care.

We apply this same integrity to protecting your privacy.

  * We do not sell your personal information to anyone. 
  * Because we limit the use of your personal information, there is no opportunity for you to opt out of sharing it with third party service providers. Please know these companies are not authorized to use it or share it for any purpose other than to help us serve you.

For example, cookies help us better understand how account owners use our website so we can improve your online experience. Once you are logged in, cookies maintain your security as you move from page to page within the site.

**What types of cookies do websites put on my computer?**

## Secure Online Account Access

**Web Security and You**  
Protecting your privacy and security is a shared responsibility. We affirm our commitment to safeguard your personal information; however, it is imperative that you protect your Password to prevent unauthorized access to your accounts. For this reason, we strongly suggest that you do not share your Password with anyone. If you do choose to give it to someone, such as a so-called "financial aggregator" that combines information about you from multiple sources over the Internet, you do so at your own risk. We cannot be responsible for any losses you may incur as a result.

**Mutual Fund and Brokerage Customers**  
Registration is the process of creating a unique User Name, Password, and setting up enhanced security features, such as picking and naming a security image and selecting and answering challenge questions. These steps are required to log in and securely access your American Century Investments accounts and other services. Any personal or financial information you provide during the Registration process is kept confidential, as stated in this Privacy and Security Policy.

**Forgotten Passwords or Locked Accounts**  
Unlock your accounts securely online by selecting the  **forgot user**   **name** link below the User Name entry field at the top of most pages on americancentury.com, and following the prompts. Investment Professionals should call 1-800-345-6488 for assistance.
