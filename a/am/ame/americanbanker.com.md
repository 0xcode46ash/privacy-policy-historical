# American Banker Online - Privacy Policy

At **American Banker Online** , we have gone to great lengths to implement fair information practices that are designed to protect your privacy. We believe that everyone benefits from the free flow of information and pledge to gather and use information about you responsibly. We welcome visitors to our site, and we want to make sure that you are comfortable. So before you explore any further, we want you to know about a few ways in which we ensure that doing business on the net is a pleasurable and profitable experience for everyone.

**SAFE TRANSACTIONS:** American Banker Online uses encryption methods so that each transaction takes place in the most secure environment possible. Encryption is the method by which your personal information, such as your credit card number, is scrambled and encoded while traveling through cyberspace. We decode the information once it has safely reached our customer representatives, to complete your transaction.

**WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT YOU:** This site collects information about you, including your email address. In addition, information you agree to provide us, such as your name, address, telephone number, and credit card number (if provided), is collected when you register.

**HOW WE USE WHAT WE LEARN:** We compile and use this information so that we may keep you apprised of upcoming events, and to design, customize, and offer new features that may be of interest to you.

**WHAT WE TELL OTHERS ABOUT YOU:** From time to time, we may be approached by third parties with an interest in identifying or contacting our customers. Perhaps they are in a similar business and have a product to offer that would interest our readers, or they are collecting information for research or for some other legitimate purpose. We must share information if legally required to do so. It is our policy to furnish information only to those third parties that have a bona fide contractual arrangement with us, holding them to the same privacy standards that we adhere to in order to prevent privacy abuses. For a more specific description of the different ways our information may be used contact Customer Service via email

**CHOICES YOU HAVE:** Some choices are available to you with respect to the information that you have provided to us. For example, if you are receiving unwanted e-mails from us or if you do not want your information shared with third parties, simply send an e-mail to our customer service department. We may still maintain a record of your visit, but we will not solicit your business if you do not wish to hear from us. 

**ANY QUESTIONS?** As you venture into cyberspace, you needn't be concerned that you must sacrifice your personal privacy by going online. It is important to recognize that the information you provide contributes to the free-flow of information that forms the foundation of the vibrant democracy in which we live. Privacy safeguards are carefully crafted to protect the individual, but also strive to preserve the social and economic benefits derived from such information. For more information on our Privacy Assurance Policy, contact Customer Service via email.
