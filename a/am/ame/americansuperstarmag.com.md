# Privacy Policy | American Superstar Magazine

**OUR COMMITMENT TO PRIVACY**

American Superstar is dedicated to protecting your privacy and handling any personal information that we obtain from you with care and respect. We strive to deliver outstanding products, services and experiences. We value your support, and most importantly, your loyalty. This Privacy Policy ("Policy") is designed to answer your questions regarding our privacy policies and principles, and demonstrate our commitment to a strong and meaningful customer relationship.

**WHAT THIS PRIVACY POLICY COVERS**

  * This policy covers how American Superstar treats personal information that American Superstar collects and receives, including information related to your past use of American Superstar products and services. Personal information is information about you that is personally identifiable like your name, address, email address, or phone number, and that is not otherwise publicly available.

  * This Site contains links to other Web sites over which we have no control. We are not responsible for the privacy policies or practices of other Web sites to which you choose to link from our Site. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of those other Web sites so you can understand how they collect, use and share your information.




**THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT**

**General**

  * American Superstar collects personal information when you register with American Superstar, when you use American Superstar products or services, when you visit American Superstar pages or the pages of certain American Superstar partners, and when you enter promotions or sweepstakes. American Superstar may combine information about you that we have with information we obtain from business partners or other companies.

  * When you register we ask for information such as your name, address, email address, zip code, phone number, birth date, gender, industry, work experience and personal interests. Once you register with American Superstar and sign in to our services, you are not anonymous to us.

  * If a user elects to use our Invite feature to invite a friend to our site, we ask them for the friend's email address. American Superstar will automatically send the friend an email inviting them to join the Site. American Superstar stores this email address for the purpose of sending reminders of the invitation. American Superstar does not sell these email addresses or use them to send any other communication besides invitations and invitation reminders. The friend may contact American Superstar to request the removal of this information from our database.

  * American Superstar collects your credit card information if you purchase a product from the Site. Your credit card information is not collected or retained by American Superstar. It, along with the personal identifying information you submit, is transferred to and used by third party financial institutions to verify the credit card numbers and to authorize the processing of the transaction. Be sure to review all privacy policies published by our third-party service providers and contact them directly if you have questions as they may have privacy terms that differ from American Superstar's Privacy Policy.

  * American Superstar automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser, including your IP address, American Superstar cookie information, and the page you request.

  * American Superstar uses information for the following general purposes: to customize the advertising and content you see, fulfill your requests for products and services, improve our services, contact you, conduct research, and provide anonymous reporting for internal and external clients.




**Children**

  * Children should always ask parents for permission before providing any personal information online. No information should be submitted to or posted on this Site by any Minor (a guest under 18 years of age) without the consent of a parent or guardian. Unless otherwise disclosed during collection, we do not knowingly provide any personally identifying information about Minors, regardless of its source, to third parties, nor is this information knowingly used by American Superstar for any marketing or promotional purposes.




**INFORMATION SHARING AND DISCLOSURE**

  * American Superstar does not rent, sell, or share personal information about you with other people or nonaffiliated companies except to provide products or services you've requested, when we have your permission, or under the following circumstances:

    * We provide the information to trusted partners who work on behalf of or with American Superstar under confidentiality agreements. These companies may use your personal information to help American Superstar communicate with you about offers from American Superstar and our marketing partners. However, these companies do not have any independent right to share this information.

    * We respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims;

    * We believe it is necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of American Superstar's Terms of Use, or as otherwise required by law.

    * We transfer information about you if American Superstar is acquired by or merged with another company. In this event, American Superstar will notify you before information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.

  * American Superstar displays targeted advertisements based on personal information. Advertisers (including ad serving companies) may assume that people who interact with, view, or click on targeted ads meet the targeting criteria - for example, males ages 18-24 from a particular geographic area.

    * American Superstar does not provide any personal information to the advertiser when you interact with or view a targeted ad. However, by interacting with or viewing an ad you are consenting to the possibility that the advertiser will make the assumption that you meet the targeting criteria used to display the ad.

    * American Superstar advertisers include financial service providers (such as banks) and non-financial companies (such as stores, media, and entertainment companies).

  * American Superstar works with vendors, partners, advertisers, and other service providers in different industries and categories of business.
