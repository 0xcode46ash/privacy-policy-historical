**Privacy**  
At Amerisave Mortgage Corporation we are dedicated to upholding a strict code of ethics and business practices. In doing so, we work hard to respect and protect our customers' privacy and security. We have listed below how we will use customer information and the forms of contact you could expect from Amerisave.

**Personal Information**  
All personal and financial information acquired by Amerisave is used to process your loan. We will never rent, sell, or share any personal information to third party marketers and will only share information that is required to close your loan. Amerisave will not share personal information with other divisions of Amerisave Mortgage Corp.

**Service Providers**  
Amerisave partners with other third parties to provide specific services required in the processing of your loan. The information that is shared with our third parties is done so in order to acquire credit reports, appraisals, titles and lending. We share names, or other contact information that is necessary for the third party to provide these services. These third parties are not allowed to use personally identifiable information except for the purpose of providing these services. Some of the information provided by you and collected by Amerisave: 

  * Client name, address, employment history, income, credit balances, property insurance coverage and other representations made by the client.
  * Client payment history, account balance and other transactional information.
  * Information obtained from consumer credit-reporting agencies (including credit history and creditworthiness).



**Security**  
Amerisave takes every precaution to protect our users' information. When users submit sensitive information via the Web site, their information is protected both online and off-line. When our application form asks users to enter sensitive information, it is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry - SSL (Secure Sockets Layer). While on a secure page, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked.

**Contact**  
Amerisave will contact you via email and phone during your loan process as needed to complete your loan.

We may also contact you in the future to provide information in regards to other financial or consumer products we feel you may have an interest in. You may opt-out of any correspondence which is not directly linked to a specific product you have applied for, by sending an email to customer service, visiting our website or following the instructions found on such correspondence.
