# Privacy Statement

|  |  | **PRIVACY POLICY**  
---  
**1\. Information Collection and Use**  
  
| American Home Guides, Inc. collects information from our users at several different points on our website including when you request information, schedule a sales center appointment, purchase listing space, and enter sweepstakes or sign up for our newsletter. American Home Guides, Inc. is the sole owner of the information collected on our websites. We share this information exclusively with our advertisers that you have requested information from. We request information from the user on several different forms including our homefinder, brochure request, information request, VIP tour request, sweepstakes entry and newsletter sign up forms. Here a user must provide contact information (like name, address, and phone number). This information is used for our advertisers to contact the user, sign up for newsletter and/or sweepstakes, and receive information. You may receive emails from time to time. Users who no longer wish to receive our information may opt-out of receiving these communications by emailing us. It may take several days to completely remove a user from all of our lists.  
**2\. Security**  
  
| This website takes every precaution to protect our users' information. When users submit sensitive information via the website, your information is protected both online and off-line. When our order form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number and/or social security number), that information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry - SSL. While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when you are just 'surfing'. To learn more about SSL, follow this link [www.verisign.com](http://www.verisign.com/)

While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect user-information off-line. All of our users' information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information. ALL employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. If you have any questions about the security at our website, you can send an email to [info@americanhomeguides.com](mailto:info@americanhomeguides.com).  
  
**3\. Cookies**  
  
| A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's hard drive containing information about the user. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on our site. Cookies can also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our site. Some of our business partners use cookies on our site (for example, advertisers). However, we have no access to or control over these cookies.  
**4\. Log Files**  
  
| We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information. No outside parties have access to this information.  
**5\. Links**  
  
| This web site contains links to our advertisers websites. Please be aware that American Home Guides, Inc. is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this Web site.  
**6\. Newsletter**  
  
| If a user wishes to subscribe to our newsletter, we ask for contact information such as name and email address. To unsubscribe from our newsletter, please email us at [unsubscribe@americanhomebuyernews.com](mailto:unsubscribe@americanhomebuyernews.com). It may take several days to completely remove a user from all of our lists.   
**7\. Surveys & Contests**  
  
| From time-to-time our site requests information from users via surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information. Information requested may include contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code, age level). Contact information will be used to notify the winners and award prizes. Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this site.  
**8\. Notification of Changes**  
  
| If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on our Homepage so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If at any point we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify users by way of an email. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected.
