# American Anti-Aging Association - Privacy Policy

**Privacy Policy**

AmericanAntiAgingAssociation.com respects privacy of Internet Users and does not collect personally identifying information without the Internet User's permission.

**Collection of Data**

AmericanAntiAgingAssociation.com does not collect Internet User identity or contact information from Internet Users' visits to AmericanAntiAgingAssociation.com Web Sites. For each visitor to a AmericanAntiAgingAssociation.com Web site, the visitor's computer reaches us via a particular IP, (Internet Protocol), address. AmericanAntiAgingAssociation.com's servers automatically collect this IP address.

An Internet User's browser sets Cookies (when enabled) that contain small amounts of data on the Internet User's computer after a visit to any web site. Cookies assist AmericanAntiAgingAssociation.com in tracking Internet Users' activities beginning from a Publisher's web site or subscription e-mail through an Advertiser's web site that the Internet User links to from the Publisher's site or e-mail. If the Internet User re-visits the Advertiser's site directly, AmericanAntiAgingAssociation.com is able to continue to track the Internet User's activities on the Advertiser's site and reward the Publisher that referred the Internet User. The Cookies themselves tell AmericanAntiAgingAssociation.com nothing about the Internet User personally.

No information is obtained from the Internet User or Internet User's computer to generate the unique identifying number of the Internet User. AmericanAntiAgingAssociation.com's servers automatically generate the unique number. None of AmericanAntiAgingAssociation.com's Cookies are used to perform "User Profiling".

AmericanAntiAgingAssociation.com does receive and record partial e-mail addresses of Internet Users, only in circumstances where the Internet User has voluntarily provided its identity and contact information through the Advertiser's Web site or Publisher's Web site. This partial e-mail address does not enable AmericanAntiAgingAssociation.com to personally identify an Internet User.

**Use and Disclosure of Data**

AmericanAntiAgingAssociation.com does not sell or rent personally identifying information. AmericanAntiAgingAssociation.com does not disclose personally identifying information to anyone that AmericanAntiAgingAssociation.com is not authorized to do so. AmericanAntiAgingAssociation.com uses anonymous user data to create and report the browsing, purchasing and/or lead form completion activities of anonymous users.

AmericanAntiAgingAssociation.com reserves the right to release information on Internet Users if compelled to do so by proper judicial or governmental authorities. Disclosure shall be limited to only to those that AmericanAntiAgingAssociation.com is compelled to disclose to. At present, all information processing occurs in the United States.

**Security Measures**

AmericanAntiAgingAssociation.com employs industry standard security measures to ensure the security of all data. Access to AmericanAntiAgingAssociation.com customer data is accessible via password protection through the Advertiser and Publisher Accounts created by each Advertiser and Publisher, and to designated AmericanAntiAgingAssociation.com employees who require system level access in order to perform their jobs. Access to Internet User data that identifies the Internet User's name and/or e-mail addresses is limited to designated AmericanAntiAgingAssociation.com employees who require such access in order to perform their jobs and to an Advertiser or Publisher that provided such information. Each Advertiser and Publisher is responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of its own password used for accessing its accounts on the AmericanAntiAgingAssociation.com Network.

**Subscription E-mails**

When working with its merchants, AmericanAntiAgingAssociation.com reserves the right to review and edit outgoing messages to ensure messages are delivered to subscribers. All information voluntarily provided to AmericanAntiAgingAssociation.com by a registrant may be used to support our marketing partner's data services business. These services include the provision of personally identifiable data to marketing companies, advertising agencies, data compilers, data companies, and, to the extent permitted by law, individual reference, email marketers and look-up service programs. Such information may be used by such companies to provide users via email with information on products and services that may be of interest to them.
