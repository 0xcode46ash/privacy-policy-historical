Security

**

When you send confidential personal account data to us on our Website, we require that a "secure session" is first established using Secure Socket Layer (SSL). For further information about SSL and the safety and confidentiality of personal data transmissions over the Internet, please read our Security Q&A. 

**Information Collection**

When you browse our Website, you do so anonymously. Personal information – including your Email address – is not collected. We may request, however, that you voluntarily supply us with personal information, including your Email address and Card Account number, for purposes such as correspondence, checking your current Card Account balance and participating in online surveys. Like many other commercial websites, the Website of AMEX (Middle East) B.S.C.(c) may utilise a standard technology called a "cookie" to collect information about how our site is used. For more information please read [About Cookies](https://web.archive.org/mena/global/legal/cookies.jsp). 

**Information Use**

If you provide us with your Email address, we may upon occasion send you E-mail offers.

All offers are carefully developed to ensure that they meet our standards. Our goal is to target offers at people who we believe will find them of value. The lists used to send you product and service offers are developed and managed under strict conditions designed to safeguard the security and privacy of customer personal information.

**Security Q & A**

**American Express realizes how important security is to you** , so we've taken a number of steps that help enhance the safety and confidentiality of transmissions of private information sent to American Express over the Internet.  
  
---|---  
  
| **Q: Is my confidential information secure?**  
A: Whenever American Express asks you to send confidential information over the Internet, including personal account data, we require that a "secure session" using SSL first be established.   
---|---  
  
| **Q: What is a "secure session" and how does it help keep my information safe?**  
A: During a secure SSL session, data passed back and forth between your computer and American Express systems is secured by using public key cryptography. Your computer exchanges key information with American Express computers to create a private conversation that only your computer and American Express systems can understand.   
---|---  
  
| **Q: What specifically is SSL?**  
A: Any time you access or supply Card account information in one of our secure online areas, that information is encrypted by a technology called Secure Sockets Layer, often abbreviated as SSL. SSL technology secretly encodes information as it is being sent over the Internet between your computer and American Express systems, helping to ensure that the information remains confidential. The use of SSL requires two components: an SSL-compatible browser and a web server to perform the "key-exchange" that establishes an SSL connection to American Express Web server systems.   
---|---  
  
| **Q: What type of browser do I need?**  
A: We use 128-bit SSL encryption. To be able to view pages protected with 128-bit SSL technology, you will need a browser with 128-bit SSL capabilities. Examples of SSL browsers include Netscape 2.0, Microsoft's Internet Explorer 3.02 or later. (Note that some older versions of browsers will not support SSL sessions). If you don't already have a browser with SSL capabilities, you can download an SSL browser from either of the links below. 

  [Netscape Navigator](http://home.netscape.com/comprod/mirror/client_download.html) or [Microsoft's Internet Explorer](http://www.microsoft.com/windows/ie/download/default.asp)  
  
---|---  
  
| **Q: Why do I need a username and password?**  
A: Many areas require the use of a username and password as an additional security measure that helps protect your confidential information. This lets American Express verify exactly who you are, thereby allowing you access to your account information, and helping prevent unauthorized access.   
---|---  
  
| **Q: What should I do when I have finished accessing confidential data?**  
A: When you have finished using the Check Your Balance facility make sure you always click on the red "Leave Secure Area" link which appears on the left hand side of every secure page. When you click on it, you will end your secure session. No further secure transactions can be conducted without re-entering your username and password.   
---|---  
  
| **Q: What if I do not use the "Leave Secure Area" link to end my session?**  
A: Your session will remain open for a short period of time, after which it will time out and your session will be closed automatically. If you are using a public Internet terminal you should always leave the secure area by following the link to ensure your session is terminated immediately.   
---|---  
  
| **Q: Why can I still see some of my account information even after I have pressed the "Leave Secure Area" link?**  
A: Browser software often "caches" pages as you look at them, meaning that some pages are saved in your computer's temporary memory. Therefore, you may find that clicking on your back button shows you a saved version of a previously viewed page. Please keep in mind that caching in no way affects the security of your confidential username or password. If you use your computer in a public place, please read "What should I do if I am using a 'public' computer?" below.   
---|---  
  
| **Q: What should I do if I am using a "public" computer?**  
A: If you use a computer that others also work with and you are uncomfortable that they may view "cached" pages after you have left the station, then please quit/exit your browser software before leaving. This will decrease the possibility of anyone viewing confidential information. No other users will be able to access your Card Account information online without your username and password.   
---|---  
  
| **Q: What are "Cookies"? Do I need to accept them ?**  
A: A cookie is a text file on your computer that reminds our system of your particular browser preferences and security requirements and lets American Express know exactly who you are. If your browser prompts you when a cookie is "served", you must accept it or access to confidential information will be denied, because we will not be able to ensure that the data is being sent to the proper parties. Because cookies are site specific, only American Express Online Services can access, decode, and make use of the information.   
---|---  
  
| **Q: After I type in my username and password and then press submit, instead of seeing my account information, I just see the same page all over again. Why does this happen?**  
A: Most probably, you are using Netscape browser software, version 4.0 or higher, with "disable cookies" chosen. For reasons described in "Why do I need to accept a 'cookie' to access my Card Account information?" below, you should make the following changes: click on "Edit", then select "Preferences", then select "Advanced" (not the plus sign next to advanced). Finally, choose either "Accept only cookies that get sent back to the originating server" or "Warn me before accepting a cookie" and press "OK". This change will allow us to confirm your identity and send you confidential account information.   
---|---  
  
| **Q: I am trying to access my Card Account information and I keep getting sent to a page that talks about browsers and security. Why?**  
A: American Express believes strongly that we have a responsibilty to protect your confidential information to the best of our abilities. In order to securely access your Card Account information via the Internet, we recommend you use the latest browser versions available. Access with Netscape versions before 1.12 (Mac or Unix) or 1.22 (Windows) is prohibited due to security concerns.
