To contact us, please go to <http://www.amnesty.org/en/contact> or call us at +44 20 7413 5500.

The terms and conditions set out below (the " **Privacy Policy** ") apply in conjunction with the [Editorial Guidelines](https://web.archive.org/en/editorial-guidelines) and [Forum Policy](https://web.archive.org/en/forum-policies) for the Amnesty International Website.

###  **Consent**

 **** Amnesty International is committed to ensuring the privacy of all our users. This Privacy Policy governs all pages on the Amnesty International Website. It does not apply to pages hosted by other organisations, including the websites of Amnesty International sections or related organisations or third party sites. The Amnesty International Website may be linked to the websites of such other parties, but those other sites may have their own privacy policies which apply to them.

By using the Amnesty International Website, you consent to the terms of this Privacy Policy. Amnesty International may change the terms of this Privacy Policy from time to time and, if such changes are made, we may place notices on the Amnesty International Website so that you can be aware of them.  Your continued use of the Amnesty International Website will be on the terms of this Privacy Policy as amended from time to time.

###  **What types of information do we collect and store?**

The type and amount of information we receive and store depends on how you use the Amnesty International Website. You can access most of the pages on the Amnesty International Website without telling us who you are and without revealing any personal information.  Our web servers collect anonymous logs during user visits to the Amnesty International Website.  This information is used to create aggregate statistics, for example about when the Amnesty International Website is accessed, the pages which refer visitors to the Amnesty International Website, the type of web browsers visitors use and which pages are viewed.  These statistics help us understand how the Amnesty International Website is used and provide us with valuable information for improving it in the future.

We do not collect personal information (such as your name, address, phone number or e-mail address) on the Amnesty International Website unless you choose to provide it.  For example, where you express an interest in joining or donating to Amnesty International, subscribe to our email updates, or wish to access certain restricted parts of the Amnesty International Website.

###  **How do we use information collected?**

Your personal information will be retained by Amnesty International and its service providers in a secure environment, will be kept confidential, and will only be used in connection with the purposes for which it is submitted, or as otherwise explained on the Amnesty International Website or as necessary for us to comply with our legal obligations.  For example, personal information submitted for the purposes of making a donation will be used to process that donation and personal information submitted with an expression of interest in joining Amnesty International will be used to action your expression of interest in joining Amnesty International and provide you with information about Amnesty International and where relevant AI Sections and AI Structures.

###  **Sharing of your personal information**

The information you provide will not be sold or rented nor will it be shared with third parties unless we have your permission, or are required to disclose the information by law or in the following circumstances: 

  1. _Sharing with Amnesty International Sections and Structures:_ In addition to Amnesty International Limited, there are several Amnesty International Sections ("AI Sections") and Amnesty International Structures ("AI Structures") located around the world, including within the UK.  An AI Section is a formally constituted body which carries out Amnesty International's work in a given country, state, territory or region.  Similarly, an AI Structure is a national or regional body established by Amnesty International to promote and implement Amnesty International's vision and missions.  Amnesty International may share your personal information with AI Sections and AI Structures located around the world, who may then use your personal information in connection with their activities related to Amnesty International or about Amnesty International's activities in general.  For example, if you have expressed an interest in joining Amnesty International or subscribing to our email updates and you are located outside of the United Kingdom, we may share your contact details with your local AI Section or AI Structure.
  2. _Hosting and processing:_ the Amnesty International Website is hosted by a third party service provider and therefore any personal details you submit through the Amnesty International Website may be processed by that third party service provider. We may also use other third parties to process your personal details.  For example, such third parties may process your personal information to action expressions of interest to join Amnesty International, process donations to Amnesty International on our behalf or process and forward mailing information for users who choose to subscribe to our email updates.  All of these third party services providers will process your personal information only on Amnesty International's behalf and will be bound by strict confidentiality conditions.
  3. _Payment processing and fraud:_ Your card details may be disclosed to banks or relevant financial institutions to arrange payments. In the case of a suspected fraudulent transaction, your details may be further disclosed for the sole purpose of performing further checks (for example, disclosure to a credit checking agency).



The disclosure of your personal information discussed above may involve transfer of that information outside of the UK and European Union.  Countries outside of the European Union, such as the United States, may not have data privacy laws as strong as those in force in the European Union.
