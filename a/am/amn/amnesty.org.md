# Privacy Policy | Amnesty International

Please read this policy carefully to understand how we collect, use and process your personal data.

### Definitions

**Amnesty International Application** means any digital application operated by Amnesty International Limited, which states that this Privacy Policy applies to that application.

**Amnesty International Limited** means Amnesty International Limited, a company limited by guarantee, registered in England (number 01606776).

**Amnesty International Website** means [www.amnesty.org](http://www.amnesty.org/) and any other website operated by Amnesty International Limited, which states that this Privacy Policy applies to that website.

### Introduction

The Amnesty International Websites and Amnesty International Applications, including all information and materials contained on them, are managed by Amnesty International Limited.

For any questions regarding this Privacy Policy please contact us using the details below. 

Amnesty International Limited is committed to ensuring the privacy of all our users. This Privacy Policy governs all pages on the Amnesty International Websites and the operation of the Amnesty International Applications. It does not apply to pages or applications hosted or operated by other organisations, including the websites or applications of Amnesty International sections or related organisations or third party sites. The Amnesty International Websites and Amnesty International Applications may be linked to the websites/applications of such other parties, but those other sites may have their own privacy policies which apply to them.

### Consent

By using any Amnesty International Website and/or Amnesty International Application, you consent to the terms of this Privacy Policy. Amnesty International Limited may change the terms of this Privacy Policy from time to time. Your continued use of the Amnesty International Website and/or Amnesty International Application will be on the terms of this Privacy Policy as amended from time to time.

### What types of information do we collect and store?

The type and amount of information we receive and store depends on how you use the Amnesty International Websites and/or Amnesty International Applications. You can access most of the pages on the Amnesty International Websites without telling us who you are and without revealing any personal information. Our web servers collect anonymous logs during user visits to the Amnesty International Websites which provide valuable information for improving it in the future.

For more information see [Use of Cookies](https://www.amnesty.org/en/about-us/cookie-statement/) page

We do not collect personal information (such as your name, address, phone number or e-mail address) on the Amnesty International Websites or Amnesty International Applications unless you choose to provide it. For example, where you express an interest in joining or donating to Amnesty International, sign a petition or email action or subscribe to our email updates. If you apply for a job or volunteer role at Amnesty International we will collect information so that we can process your application and assess your suitability for the role. On Amnesty International Applications, we automatically collect only randomly generated unique user number to identify your application, and other non personal information.

### How do we use information collected?

Your personal information will be retained by Amnesty International Limited and its service providers in a secure environment, will be kept confidential, and will only be used in connection with the purposes for which it is submitted, or as otherwise explained on the Amnesty International Website or Amnesty International Application, or as necessary for us to comply with our legal obligations. For example, personal information submitted for the purposes of making a donation will be used to process that donation and personal information submitted with an expression of interest in joining Amnesty International will be used to action your expression of interest in joining Amnesty International and provide you with information about Amnesty International.

### Security

We take appropriate security measures to ensure that we keep your information secure, accurate and up to date, and that we only keep it for as long as is reasonable and necessary. However the transmission of information over the Internet is never completely secure, so while we do our best to protect personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of information transmitted to the Amnesty International Websites and/or Amnesty International Applications.

### Sharing of your personal information

The information you provide will not be sold or rented nor will it be shared with third parties unless we have your permission, or are required to disclose the information by law or in the following circumstances:

1\. Sharing with Amnesty International Sections and Structures: In addition to Amnesty International Limited, there are several Amnesty International Sections and Structures located around the world, including within the UK. An Amnesty International Section is a formally constituted body which carries out Amnesty International's work in a given country, state, territory or region. Similarly, an Amnesty International Structure is a national or regional body established by Amnesty International to promote and implement Amnesty International's vision and missions. Amnesty International may share your personal information with Amnesty International Sections and Structures located around the world, who may then use your personal information in connection with their activities related to Amnesty International or about Amnesty International's activities in general. For example, if you have expressed an interest in joining Amnesty International or sign a petition, we may share your contact details with your local Amnesty International Section or Structure.

2\. Hosting and processing: the Amnesty International Websites and Amnesty International Applications are hosted by third party service providers and therefore any personal details you submit through the Amnesty International Website and/or Amnesty International Applications may be processed by that third party service provider. We may also use other third parties to process your personal details. For example, such third parties may process your personal information to action expressions of interest to join Amnesty International, process donations to Amnesty International on our behalf or process and forward mailing information for users sign up to our online actions and/or choose to subscribe to our email updates. All of these third party services providers will process your personal information only on Amnesty International Limited's behalf and will be bound by strict confidentiality conditions.

3\. Payment processing and fraud: Where submitted, your card details may be disclosed to banks or relevant financial institutions to arrange payments. In the case of a suspected fraudulent transaction, your details may be further disclosed for the sole purpose of performing further checks (for example, disclosure to a credit checking agency).

The disclosure of your personal information discussed above may involve transfer of that information outside of the UK and European Union. Countries outside of the European Union, such as the United States, may not have data privacy laws as strong as those in force in the European Union.

### Use of cookies

A cookie is a text-only piece of information that a website transfers to your computer's hard disk so that the website can remember who you are. A cookie will normally contain the name of the Internet domain from which the cookie has come, the "lifetime" of the cookie, and a value, usually a randomly generated unique number.
