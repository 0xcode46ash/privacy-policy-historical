**Normal Website Usage**

You can visit most portions of Amnesty International USA's web site without telling us who you are and without revealing any personal information. The only information we collect from a normal website visit is the name of your Internet service provider, the browser and type of machine you are using, the web site that referred you to us, the pages you request and the date and time of those requests. 

We use this information to generate statistics and measure site activity to improve the usefulness of the site to our visitors. During a normal web site visit, we do not collect or store personally identifiable information such as name, mailing address, email address, phone number or social security of the visitor. 

We collect the IP addresses of visitors, time of access, browser type, and web pages visited. We collect this information on an aggregate basis only. For example, we track which pages are most popular among visitors as a whole. This information is used for internal review only and not shared with third parties. We do not track information on which pages an individual visitor might look at during a visit to our site. We do not collect any other information without the visitor's knowledge and permission.

**Collection of Personally Identifiable Information**

There are instances where Amnesty International USA requests personally identifiable information to provide you with services or correspondence (such as petitions and actions). This information, such as name, mailing address, email address, type of request and possibly additional information, is collected and stored in a manner appropriate to the nature of the data by Amnesty International USA and is used to fulfill your request. Amnesty International USA makes every effort to insure the secure collection and transmission of sensitive user information using industry accepted data collection and encryption methodologies such as SSL (Secure Sockets Layer).

Amnesty International may sell, rent, or exchange limited personally identifiable information (such as name and mailing address) of persons who join or donate with partner organizations unless the user has specified that they do not wish the information to be disclosed (See Opting Out below). Amnesty International does not sell, rent or exchange e-mail addresses to partners. Amnesty International, likewise, does not disclose any financial information to partners.

Our site uses order forms for users to request information, products and services, or to make donations. We collect visitor's contact information (like their email address).

Users may opt out of receiving future mailings.
