13.3 How does we use cookies?

On our websites, cookies record information about your online preferences, remember information about you when you visit our site and compile statistical reports on website activity. Some cookies are used that are essential in order to provide our services to you.

During the course of any visit to amnesty.org.uk, your navigation through the site is recorded by a cookie that is downloaded to your device. The information recorded is retrieved on a repeat visit to the site by checking to see, and finding, the cookie left there on the last visit.

Information supplied by cookies can help us to analyse the profile of our visitors and help us to provide you with a better user experience. Below we have set out the four categories of cookies that AIUK uses on our website.

These cookies are:

  * Strictly necessary cookies - These cookies are essential in order to enable you to move around the website and use its features.. Without these cookies, services you have asked for, such as making payments for donations cannot be provided. These cookies do not gather information about you that could be used for marketing or remembering where you have been on the internet.


  * Performance cookies - These cookies collect information about how our visitors use the website, for instance which pages visitors go to most often, and if they get error messages from any web pages. They also allow us to record and count the number of visitors to the website, all of which enables us to see how visitors use the website in order to improve the way that our website works. These cookies do not collect information that identifies a visitor, as all information these cookies collect is anonymous and is only used to improve how our website works.


  * Functionality cookies - These cookies allow our website to remember choices you make (such as your login details or your choices in relation to our newsletters and subscriptions). Whenever these cookies are used we will notify you before using the cookie, providing more information about the functionality cookie to be used, and how it might improve your user experience. The information these cookies collect is usually anonymised. They do not gather any information about you that could be used for advertising or remember where you have been on the internet. AIUK doesn't currently collect this type of cookies. If we decide to do so in the future we will up date this policy.


  * Targeting cookies - These cookies collect several pieces of information about your browsing habits. They are placed by our third party service provider [although we may also place a cookie that collects this kind of information]. All of the information that these cookies collect is anonymised, although they contain a unique key that is able to distinguish, for example, individual user browsing habits, or log if an individual user has clicked on a one of our suggested recommendations. These cookies can track your visits around the website, but they do not usually know who you are. They remember that you have visited our website and your browsing habits on our website to improve your experience, so that our recommendations are a better fit for you. This information is only shared between us and our third party service provider. Without these cookies, the user experience on our website will be less relevant to you and your interests.



##  14\. Security

14.1 When you submit your Information to us on any of the Sites, we take steps to ensure that your information is treated securely. Unfortunately, it is not possible to guarantee the total security of any data transmitted over the Internet. While we strive to protect your Information, Amnesty International UK cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us, and you therefore do this at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission, we take reasonable steps to ensure its security on our systems, but we take no responsibility for any unauthorised access or loss of personal information that is beyond our control. 

14.2 Please remember that other methods of Internet communication, such as emails and messages sent via a website, are not secure unless they are encrypted.   

##  15\. Changes to this policy

Our Privacy Policy may change from time to time.  In this case, the amended version will be published on the Site.

This policy will be updated if there are any changes in our practice.
