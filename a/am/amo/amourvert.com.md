Personal information is information about you that is personally identifiable like your name, address, email address, or phone number, and that is not otherwise publicly available.

When you register we ask for information such as your name, email address, birth date, gender, zip code, occupation, industry, and personal interests. Once you register with Amour Vert and sign in to our services, you are not anonymous to us.

You can edit your Amour Vert account information at any time. We reserve the right to send you certain communications relating to the Amour Vert service, such as service announcements, administrative messages and the Amour Vert Newsletter, that are considered part of your Amour Vert account, without offering you the opportunity to opt-out of receiving them.

We have physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that comply with federal regulations to protect personal information about you.

Amour Vert does not rent, sell, or share personal information about you with other people or nonaffiliated companies except to provide products or services you've requested, when we have your permission, or under the following circumstances:

We provide the information to trusted partners who work on behalf of or with Amour Vert under confidentiality agreements. These companies may use your personal information to help Amour Vert communicate with you about offers from Amour Vert and our marketing partners.

We respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims;

We believe it is necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of Amour Vert' terms of use, or as otherwise required by law.

We transfer information about you if Amour Vert is acquired by or merged with another company. In this event, Amour Vert will notify you before information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
