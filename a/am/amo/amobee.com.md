**Web Beacons / Gifs**

We do not link this automatically-collected data to Personal Information.   


  * **3rd Party Tracking** \- The use of cookies by our tracking utility is not covered by our privacy statement.  We do not have access or control over these cookies.  Our tracking utility uses session ID cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our site.

The security of your Personal Information is important to us.  We follow generally accepted security standards to protect the Personal Information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.  No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however.  Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security, and Amobee shall have no liability of any type or nature for any breach of security by a third party.
