A.M. Best has technological and operational security functions in place to protect personally identifiable information from loss, misuses, alteration or destruction. Only authorized employees have access to the data you provide and that access is limited by need. In addition, our e-Commerce servers support the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption protocol, which protects credit card transaction information received from our customers. If your browser supports the SSL protocol, our order processing software will ensure your private data is submitted to a secure URL (Uniform Resource Locator - basically a "web site address").

This information is used exclusively for internal purposes and is not disclosed to any third parties. 

Some of A.M. Best's pages do use "cookies" - one or more small text files saved on your computer's hard drive and stored in memory while your browser is running. A.M. Best assigns a random number to each visitor and stores this number as a cookie on the your computer. This allows A.M. Best to monitor your activity throughout the sites and correlate usage patterns.
