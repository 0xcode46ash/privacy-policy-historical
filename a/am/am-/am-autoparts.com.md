# AM Autoparts

Here at AM-Autoparts, we are committed to our customersâ€™ privacy. When purchasing our products, we do need to collect some necessary information to complete your order, such as your name, address, credit card number, email address, etc. All of the information collected on our site is held in a secure location. We are the sole owner of this information, and we do not share, sell, or rent this information to anybody, ever. 

We occasionally send out emails that may include coupons, surveys, or other promotional items. Customers can opt out of these emails at any time. Information collected from these emails is used solely for data analysis by AM-Autoparts. We are always trying to improve customer satisfaction and promotional emails are a great way for us to hear customer feedback. 

Our website traffic and site navigation patterns can be tracked by our customers' IP addresses. AM-Autoparts uses this IP tracking information for our own data analysis and we do not share, sell or rent this information either. 

Future changes to this Privacy Policy may be made at any time. They will always be available right here at the bottom of the AM-Autoparts home page.
