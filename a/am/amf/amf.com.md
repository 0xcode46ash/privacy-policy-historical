# Privacy Policy - AMF Bowling

Any information gathered will be used by AMF. AMF recognizes the importance of protecting the privacy of all information provided by users of our Internet properties. We created the following policy guidelines with a fundamental respect for our users' right to privacy and to guide our relationships with our users. This Privacy Policy is subject to change at AMF's sole discretion. You should check back every time you visit the site to review the current policy.

**Information Collected by AMF**  
AMF collects information about users during their registration, their inquiries, their participation in certain activities on our website, including contests and polls, and through the use of cookies. When users request pages from our server, our web server automatically collects some information about the users, including their IP addresses. These addresses are used by computers on the network to send the requested pages to users.

**Use of Information**  
AMF will not sell or distribute user information to outside third parties. Except as may be required by law or court order, AMF will not reveal to any third party any personal information that users provide to AMF without the permission of the users. AMF utilizes users' IP addresses to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer our website. We also use it to gather broad demographic information about our users in general. This information does not contain anything that can personally identify users.

Using email addresses provided at registration or otherwise, AMF periodically sends out promotional email to our users about services and products offerings. Users can indicate that they do or do not wish to receive email information from AMF. Third parties are not authorized to contact our users through the use of our email lists.

Upon request, AMF will remove users (and their information) from our database or permit them to "opt-out" of any further email communications or contact.

Our site uses cookies to deliver content specific to users' interests and to honor their preferences. This information is used to assist us in creating a site that will serve the needs of our users.

**General**  
AMF is not responsible for the content or the privacy polices of websites to which it may provide links or the websites of its advertisers or clients.

Please review our [Terms and Conditions](https://web.archive.org/corporate/Terms_of_Use.htm) for using this Web Site. 

**Additional Privacy Protection for Children**  
This Site is not aimed at children under 13 years of age. Any Information submitted through the Contact Form and AMF Fun Club pages that we know or reasonably believe originated from a child under 13 years of age will be deleted. Children should never reveal their addresses, phone numbers or other personally identifying information to any strangers on the Internet.

AMF uses reasonable precautions to keep the personal information disclosed to us secure and to disclose such information only to responsible third parties after permission from the user.
