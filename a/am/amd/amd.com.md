### Cookies, Web Beacons & Other Tracking Technologies

A cookie is small file that a website can send to your browser, which may then store it on your system. 

We use cookies to allow Us to understand what areas of the Site are of interest to you so We can better serve and provide you with tailored information from the Ste. We use cookies that We place on the Site to collect data such as information about your web browser and operating system, the frequency of your visits, what you do on the Site and, if you arrived at the Site from another website, the URL of that website. Our third party web analytics provider then collects and analyses the data We obtain from Our cookies to tell Us how you use the Site.

AMD may also use cookies when you register for some parts of the Site such as Our web programs or extranets. In this case, a cookie will store useful information, including your personal information, which enables the Site to remember you when you return to visit. Only We can read the information We gather from the cookies We place on your system.

We also, through third party vendors, use remarketing techniques on the Site. When you visit the Site remarketing allows Our third party vendors to show you adverts for Our products that you browsed for on the Site when you visit other websites on the Internet. To do this Our third party vendors use cookies that they place on the Site to identify the products and topics on the Site that you have browsed for. They then use the information obtained from these cookies to serve you with adverts relevant to these products and topics when you visit other websites on the Internet. Information about your use of the Site which is used for remarketing is deleted after 30 days.

You can set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether to accept it. Please refer to your browser instructions or help screen for information about how to do this. You may also delete cookies whenever you wish. However, this will mean that any information you have entered onto the Site will be lost. For example, the Site will not recognise you on your next visit and you will have to re-enter any personal details you had previously inputted. Please note that if you choose not to accept cookies you may not have may not have access to certain features that make your experience of the Site more efficient and some of the features on the Site may not function properly. You can find out more about cookies, including how to delete them, at <http://www.allaboutcookies.org/>.

The Site may also use “Web beacon” technologies. When you access pages on with a Web beacon, an anonymous notice of that visit is generated which may be processed by Us or by Our analytics vendors. These Web beacons work in conjunction with cookies to let Us know what portions of the Site are of interest to Our visitors, how many of Our newsletters have been read and to help Us provide you with tailored information from the Site.

If you choose not to accept cookies, Web beacon technologies will still detect anonymous visits, but the notices they generate cannot be associated with other information and are disregarded.

We use third party advertising companies for banner placements who in turn use pixels, or transparent GIF files, to help manage online advertising. These GIF files are provided by our ad management partner. These files enable our ad management partner to recognize a unique cookie on your web browser, which in turn enables Us to learn which advertisements bring users to the Site. The cookie is placed by Us and Our ad management partner who works with advertising solutions companies (including DoubleClick). With both cookies and Spotlight technology (the tool used to determine the effectiveness of online advertising), the information that We collect and share is anonymous and not personally identifiable. It does not contain your name, address, telephone number, or email address, for example. For more information about DoubleClick, including information about how to opt out of these technologies, go to [http://www.doubleclick.com/privacy/index.aspx](http://www.doubleclick.net/us/corporate/privacy). You may also opt-out of receiving targeted advertising from some advertising networks.
