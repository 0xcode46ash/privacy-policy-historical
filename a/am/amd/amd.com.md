**Advanced Micro Devices Privacy Overview**

Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) is committed to respecting your privacy. In general, you can visit amd.com without revealing any information about yourself. AMD and its analytic vendors do collect information regarding visitors to our Web site, such as domain name, number of visits,and average time spent to measure use and improve the content of our site. We analyze this data for trends and statistics to help us provide you with better service. Our Web site may provide links to third party sites. Since we do not control those Web sites, we encourage you to review the privacy policies of these third party sites. AMD is not responsible for the privacy practices or content of third party web sites. 

**Personal Information**

There are times when we may request information from you, such as your, name, address and e-mail address. When additional information is requested, we will try to let you know at the time of collection how we intend to use the personal information you provide, such as respond to your inquiry, participate in certain promotions, conduct a survey or allow you to access specific information. If you sign up for an AMD electronic newsletter or e-mail list, each message will include instructions on how to "unsubscribe" from that list. We respect your right to choose whether to give us personal information or "opt out" if you do not wish to disclose personal information. We do our best to maintain the accuracy of any personal information you do supply to us. 

**Disclosure of Information**

We may transfer or otherwise disclose information we collect from site visitors to employees and independent contractors of AMD, analytic vendors, and other service providers and suppliers, if the disclosure will enable that party to perform a business, professional, or technical support function for AMD. We will also transfer or otherwise disclose information we collect from site visitors in response to judicial process, and, as permitted under applicable provisions of law, to provide information to law enforcement agencies or in connection with an investigation on a matter related to public safety. Except as noted above, information we collect from site visitors will not be shared with individuals or other companies unrelated to, or that do not perform a business, professional or technical function for, AMD. 

**Security and Quality**

AMD is committed to taking reasonable steps to protect the individual identifying information that you provide. You can help AMD update and maintain the accuracy of any personal information you supply by notifying AMD of any changes to your address, title, phone number or e-mail address. In some programs, you may do this online by following the instructions on membership profile pages. 

**Cookies, Web Beacons & Other Tracking Technologies **

AMD uses cookies to allow us to understand what areas of our Web site are of interest to you so we can better serve and provide you with tailored information from our Web site. A cookie is an element of data that a Web site can send to your browser, which may then store it on your system. You can set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether to accept it. These cookies do not track individual information, but rather record Web site traffic anonymously. AMD may also use cookies when you register for one of our web programs or extranets. In this case, a cookie will store useful information, including your personal information, which enables our Web site to remember you when you return to visit, but only AMD Web sites can read that information. 

Some AMD Web sites may also use “Web beacon” technologies. When a visitor accesses pages on the AMD Web site with a Web beacon, an anonymous notice of that visit is generated which may be processed by us or by our vendors. These Web beacons work in conjunction with cookies to let us know what portions of our site are of interest to our visitors and to help us provide you with tailored information from our web site. 

If you turn off cookies, Web beacon technologies will still detect anonymous visits, but the notices they generate cannot be associated with other anonymous information or personally-identifiable information and are disregarded. 

**Oversight or Questions**

AMD welcomes comments and questions on this policy. As stated above, we are dedicated to protecting your privacy and will make every reasonable effort to keep your information secure. Due to the rapidly evolving changes on the Internet, we may update this policy. All revisions will be posted to this site. Comments and questions regarding our policy should be directed to [privacy.policy@amd.com](mailto:privacy.policy@amd.com).

We will only provide those companies the information they need to deliver the service, and they are prohibited, by contract, from using that information for any other purpose.

**Web Beacons**

AMD uses HBX and HitBox web analytics services which contain electronic image requests (called a "single-pixel gif" or "web beacon" request). We include web beacons in HTML-formatted newsletters that we send to opt-in subscribers in order to count how many newsletters have been read. Our web beacons do not collect, gather, monitor or share any personal information about our web site visitors, they are just the technique we use to compile our anonymous information about web site usage. 

**Spotlight Tags**

AMD uses third party advertising companies for banner placements who in turn use pixels, or transparent GIF files, to help manage online advertising. These GIF files are provided by our ad management partner. These files enable our ad management partner to recognize a unique cookie on your Web browser, which in turn enables us to learn which advertisements bring users to our website. The cookie is placed by us and our ad management partner who works with DoubleClick. With both cookies and Spotlight technology, the information that we collect and share is anonymous and not personally identifiable. It does not contain your name, address, telephone number, or email address.
