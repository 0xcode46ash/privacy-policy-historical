"Services" means services provided by or on this Site, the Site itself, and any other services as defined in the [Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/career-center-terms-of-use) for this Site, which are incorporated by reference. This Privacy Statement does not apply to information that We may collect by other methods. 

Please read this Privacy Statement carefully, as it will tell you what information We collect about you and your use of Our Services, how We collect, use, share, and protect that information, and the choices you have about how We use and share such information. By using Our Site or Services, you agree that you fully understand and unambiguously consent to this Privacy Statement and to all other relevant terms, including Our [Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/career-center-terms-of-use) for this Site. 

**Consent to Processing in the United States ("U.S.") and elsewhere.** This Site is owned and operated by Amgen Inc. in the U.S. The information that you provide will be accessible to Amgen Inc. in the USA but also to Our subsidiaries in other countries. The information you provide will also be accessible to companies We contract with that are located in countries around the world to assist with the Services such as recruitment process vendors and recruiters. Furthermore, if you are visiting this Site from a country other than the U.S., your communication with Us will necessarily result in the transfer of information across international boundaries.

## Information We Collect

We have access to the following categories of information about you and your use of Our Services. Only some of this information identifies you directly, but some information that does not identify you directly could be used to make inferences about you and, if combined with other information, might be capable of identifying you. 

## Information That You Provide

**Personally Identifiable Information.** "Personally Identifiable Information" is information that could be used to identify or contact you and includes data such as your name, address, telephone number, e-mail address and biographical information. There may be many other kinds of Personally Identifiable Information, the foregoing list is provided by example only. 

**Site Registration**.You may browse jobs on this Site without registering. To apply for a job, make your resume available for future jobs, and/or set up a Search Agent, you must register for a new User Account. The new User Account set up requires an e-mail address, password, and security question. You must then set up a Career Profile where you are required to provide the following Personally Identifiable Information: first name, last name, country, home phone number, e-mail address and source that referred you to Amgen. You may also submit additional information, such as your employment and educational history, to provide a more complete Career Profile. You have the opportunity at any time to update your Personally Identifiable Information contained in your Career Profile. **Within the Career Profile is a button titled Delete Profile. Clicking on this button will delete your User Account – however it will not terminate Amgen's access to your Career Profile. Even if you click on the Delete button, your Career Profile will remain available to Amgen. Further, use of the Delete button will not remove or retract any job applications you previously submitted or remove your Personally Identifiable Information from the system. If you wish to re-enter the system after using this functionality you will be required to set up a new User Account.**

Any Personally Identifiable Information provided by you contained in the Career Profile is kept in our system as allowed by applicable law, unless you send Us an e-mail asking Us to delete it - even then, we will keep your information in our system as required by applicable law and any legal holds. For more information, see the section below entitled Access, Correct, Update, or Delete* Personally Identifiable Information.

You may be given the opportunity to provide information on your gender and race/ethnicity where permitted by applicable law. We may gather this information from job candidates for reporting and record-keeping requirements. You should understand that, if provided, We will only use this information in accordance with applicable law and will not use it in making any employment decisions. Providing this information is strictly voluntary, and you will not be subject to any adverse action or treatment if you choose not to provide it. Such information will be kept in a confidential file separate from your application for employment.

We encourage you to exercise good security practices by memorizing your e-mail address and password or keeping them in a safe place (separate from any Personally Identifiable Information), and logging out of your User Account and closing your Web browser before leaving your computer. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your User Name and password. You may not share your password with anyone else, temporarily or permanently, and you will be responsible for all uses of your User Account, whether or not authorized by you. You agree to immediately notify Us if you become aware of any unauthorized use of your User Account.

**Search Agent.** When you use the Site, you can also create what we call a "Search Agent" so that you can be automatically notified by Us when jobs meeting your search criteria have been posted. When you create a Search Agent, you will specify the search criteria based on your interests, provide your email address, and indicate how frequently you would like to be notified of matching positions. We may use the information you provide to contact or notify you of available positions that meet your criteria, or as otherwise permitted by this Privacy Statement.

**Amgen Recruiters.** Even if you do not complete a Search Agent, and even if you only apply for a single position through the Site, Amgen recruiters (including both Amgen employees and Amgen contractors that act as recruiters for Amgen) may contact you about other jobs for which you have not applied but that may be of interest to you based on information you provide about yourself through this Site.

## Information That Is Routinely Collected By Our Site Technology

**General Use.** Whenever you use Our Site, We collect log information, which your Web browser automatically sends whenever you visit a Web site on the Internet. Our servers automatically record this log information, which may include your Web request, Internet Protocol ("IP") address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request, and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser (see description of cookies below).

**Cookies.** We collect information about your use of Our Site through cookies and similar technology. A "cookie" is a unique numeric code that We transfer to your computer so that We can keep track of your interests and preferences and recognize you as a return visitor to Our Site. Cookie technology allows Us to collect "clickstream" data, which is not Personally Identifiable Information but which reflects your activities on the Site, including the pages you view. Our cookies do not collect or keep your name or other Personally Identifiable Information. We use the information collected by cookies for general statistical purposes, such as to track how many candidates run job searches, how many click to apply for a job or jobs, and how many actually submit an application for a position. 

**Web Beacons.** Web beacons are tiny graphic image files embedded in a Web page or e-mail that send information from your browser back to the beacon's originating server. The information collected by Web beacons allows a Web site to statistically monitor how many people are using the site. A third party service provider used by Amgen places Web beacons on this Site to track a user's activity on this Site or across sites, or to let Us know if a user has opened an e-mail that We sent. The third party service provider uses web beacons to track which job board(s) (e.g., Monster.com), if any, you visited before arriving at this Site; whether you clicked through to this Site from a job board where an Amgen job was advertised, and/or whether you applied for a position and, if so, for which position(s) you applied. The information collected by the Web beacons is not personally identifiable.

## Our Security Measures

We want your personal information to remain as secure as reasonably possible. 

**Data Security.** When you transmit Personally Identifiable Information directly to Our Site (as opposed to sending an e-mail), we use encryption technology to protect the integrity and privacy of the data. As an added security precaution, all Personally Identifiable Information is kept physically behind firewalls that meet or exceed industry standards to prevent intruders from gaining access. Although We will make reasonable efforts to protect Personally Identifiable Information from loss, misuse, or alteration by third parties, you should be aware that there is always some risk that an unauthorized third party could intercept an Internet transmission, or that someone will find a way to thwart Our security systems. 

## Changes in Our Privacy Statement

We will only use your Personally Identifiable Information in the manner described in the Privacy Statement in effect when you provided the information. However, We reserve the right to change the terms of this Privacy Statement, the Terms of Use, and other related terms at any time by posting revisions to this Site. All such changes will be effective when posted, and your use of Our Site or any of Our Services thereafter will constitute acceptance of, and agreement to be bound by, those changes. Accordingly, you should review the Privacy Statement for this Site each time you visit or log in to this Site. In the event We make any material change to this Privacy Statement that alters the use of your Personally Identifiable Information, we will notify you of such change by email, and you will have the opportunity to have that information deleted in accordance with the Deletion Policy set forth above. 

Effective date: March 2014.
