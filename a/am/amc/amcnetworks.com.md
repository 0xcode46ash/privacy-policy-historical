## II. Collection of Personal Information by Rainbow-Media

We provide various informative features as part of this website, including Rainbow Media network programming and media services.  We may also offer opportunities for website interaction, submissions or registrations.  To operate these features, we may request and collect certain personal information provided by our visitors, including, but not limited to, name, home and email addresses, telephone numbers and other identifying information.  We may also obtain additional information from publicly available sources, and we may combine this publicly available information with information that we collect from you.

## **III. Collection of Personal Information by Affiliates or Sponsors**

Certain entities under common ownership or control with Rainbow (“Rainbow Affiliates") or third party website sponsors may join with us to offer website features.  For these features, the Rainbow Affiliate or sponsor may request and collect your personal information.  If you submit personal information for such joint offerings, you are submitting the information to both parties for their own use.  Use and disclosure of your personal information by a Rainbow Affiliate or sponsor is subject to that party’s privacy policy. Personal information collected in conjunction with such features may be used for the marketing of additional services, promotions or events. 

Rainbow, its parents, and Rainbow Affiliates are not responsible for the collection, use and disclosure practices of third parties, including those of third party website sponsors.

## ****IV. Collection of Non-Personal Information

We may collect non-personal information about visitors through use of cookies or gifs.

**Cookies.**   A cookie is a small data file that contains a unique identification number that a website places on your hard drive. The "cookie" is able to store information such as data about your computer, the type of browser you use, and how many times your computer visits a certain site and selections chosen.

**Gifs.**   A clear gif [Graphics Interchange Format] (also known as pixel tags, web beacons or web bugs) is a tiny line of code only 1 by 1 pixel in size that is programmed to collect certain information about a visit to a particular website, such as how many hits a site link receives or to retrieve certain cookies or track visitor preferences.

These devices may automatically collect certain data, including Internet server and browser identification, Internet service provider, clickstream information, the web page from which a visitor enters our site, web pages visited, usage patterns, duration of site visit and domain type.  The information collected through use of cookies or gifs is non-personal information (that is, information that does not, by itself, identify you).

However, the aggregate data collected by these tracking devices may electronically link to some personal information that you voluntarily provide over our website. When combined with your personal information, this data will be protected as personal information in accordance with this policy.

To prevent the automatic recording of information through cookies, you can configure your browser to either reject all cookies or notify you when a cookie is sent.  If you disable cookie tracking, however, you may find that some areas on the website will be slower or may not function at all.

## ****V. Use of Personal Information by Rainbow-Media

We may use collected personal information to respond to visitor inquiries or requests; allow online submissions or registrations; improve our services; protect the security of our visitors, system, service and/or website; for marketing, advertising and/or promotional use; for resume submissions and employment consideration; and to survey visitors about various topics, including their entertainment preferences and service offerings.  We may also use personal information to generate anonymized or aggregated information from which all information that personally identifies you has been removed.

Individuals who may have authorized access to personal information include our employees, agents, and affiliates within our family of affiliated businesses (including but not limited to Madison Square Garden and Cablevision), though we seek to limit access to individuals on a need to know basis.  Sometimes, we may provide access to certain information to select third parties to assist us in providing services or for other legitimate business purposes.  For example, we may provide access to certain information to companies providing services to us, including installation and repair, billing, call center, sales and marketing, market research, fulfillment, mailings, data storage, analysis and processing, bill collection, auditing and accounting, credit reporting, and legal services.  We may also provide access to third parties who assist us in providing targeted advertising and audience analysis initiatives.  The frequency of such access depends on our business needs.

We may use and/or disclose to third parties non-personal information, including anonymized or aggregated information, for any reason, including to gauge the effectiveness of our website and site features; tailor our website to specific interests; estimate our audience site; conduct research or audits; simplify site navigation; or to deliver a more personalized website service.  Our collection, use, and disclosure of non-personal information is not subject to any of the restrictions in this policy and is subject to our sole discretion.

## ****VI. Disclosure of Personal Information

We may disclose your personal information to third parties when you consent to the disclosure.  You acknowledge, consent and agree that we may access, preserve and disclose your Subscriber Information, including your Personally Identifiable Information, your account information and content if required to do so by law or in a good faith belief that such access, preservation or disclosure is reasonably necessary to: (a) comply with legal process; (b) enforce our Terms of Service, Privacy Policy, or other contracts with you; (c) respond to claims that any content violates the rights of third parties; (d) respond to your requests for customer service; or (e) protect the rights, property or personal safety of Cablevision, its agents and affiliates, its users and the public.  We may also disclose information to law enforcement agencies in emergency circumstances, where the disclosure of such information is consistent with the types of emergency disclosures permitted or required by law.

We reserve the right to disclose and transfer all of your information, both personal and non-personal, to a successor company in connection with a merger, acquisition or sale of all, or components, of our business.

We may disclose aggregate, non-personal information to other parties for other purposes.

We use reasonable commercial efforts to protect the security of personal information transmitted to us through our website and stored by us.  We require our employees to protect the privacy of visitors’ personal information and restrict access to databases containing visitor personal information.

Please remember that despite our security measures, the transmission of data over the Internet is not guaranteed to be completely secured.  Parties not under the control of Rainbow, its parents, or Rainbow Affiliates may intercept or access electronic transmissions or other data without authorization.  Thus, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of information you send to or receive from us. Any electronic transmissions that you submit or accept are at your own risk.
