(i) it is impracticable for Sigma to seek the individual’s consent before that particular use; 

(ii) the individual having been offered the opportunity of declining to receive direct marketing communication at no charge has not declined; 

(iii) the individual has not made a request to the organisation not to receive direct marketing communications;

(ii) the use or disclosure is conducted in accordance with guidelines approved by the Commissioner under section 95A of the Commonwealth Privacy Act; and

(i) a serious and imminent threat to an individual’s life, health or safety; or

(ii) a serious threat to public health or public safety; or

(ii) the enforcement of laws relating to the confiscation of the proceeds of crime;

(iii) the protection of the public revenue;

(iv) the prevention, detection, investigation or remedying of seriously improper conduct or prescribed conduct;

(v) the preparation for, or conduct of, proceedings before any court or tribunal, or implementation of the orders of a court or tribunal.

3.2 If Sigma uses or discloses personal information under paragraph 3.1(h), it must make a written note of the use or disclosure.

3.3 Despite subclause 3.1, Sigma may disclose health information about an individual to a person who is responsible for the individual if:

(i) is physically or legally incapable of giving consent to the disclosure; or

(ii) physically cannot communicate consent to the disclosure; 

(b) Sigma is satisfied that either:

(i) the disclosure is necessary to provide appropriate care or treatment of the individual; or

(d) the disclosure is limited to the extent reasonable and necessary for a purpose mentioned in paragraph (b).

4\. Data quality  
Sigma will take reasonable steps to ensure that the personal information it collects, uses or discloses is accurate, complete and up-to-date.

5\. Data security 

5.1 Sigma will take reasonable steps to protect the personal information it holds from misuse and loss and from unauthorised access, modification or disclosure.

5.2 Sigma will take reasonable steps to destroy or permanently de-identify personal information if it is no longer needed.

7\. Access and correction

7.1 Sigma will provide an individual with access to the information on request by the individual, except to the extent that: 

(a) in the case of personal information other than health information providing access would pose a serious and imminent threat to the life or health of any individual; 

(b) in the case of health information providing access would pose a serious threat to the life or health of any individual; 

(c) providing access would have an unreasonable impact upon the privacy of other individuals;

(e) the information relates to existing or anticipated legal proceedings between Sigma and the individual, and the information would not be accessible by the process of discovery in those proceedings; 

(f) providing access would reveal the intentions of Sigma in relation to negotiations with the individual in such a way as to prejudice those negotiations;

(j) providing access would be likely to prejudice:

(i) the prevention, detection, investigation, prosecution or punishment of criminal offences, breaches of a law imposing a penalty sanction or breaches of a prescribed law; 

(ii) the enforcement of laws relating to the confiscation of the proceeds of crime; 

(iii) the protection of the public revenue; 

(iv) the prevention, detection, investigation or remedying of seriously improper conduct or prescribed conduct;

by or on behalf of an enforcement body; or

(k) an enforcement body performing a lawful security function asks Sigma not to provide access to the information.

7.2 However, where providing access would reveal evaluative information generated within Sigma in connection with a commercially sensitive decision making process Sigma may give the individual an explanation for the commercially sensitive decision rather than direct access to the information.

7.3 If Sigma is not required to provide the individual with access to the information because of one or more of paragraphs 7.1(a) to (k) (inclusive), Sigma will, if reasonable, consider whether the use of mutually agreed intermediaries would allow sufficient access to meet the needs of both parties.

7.4 Sigma may charge a fee reasonable for providing access to personal information, (but not for lodging a request for access):

7.5 If Sigma holds personal information about an individual and the

individual is able to establish that the information is not accurate, complete and up to date, Sigma will take reasonable steps to correct the information so that it is accurate, complete and up to date.

7.6 If the individual and Sigma disagree about whether the information is accurate, complete and up to date, and the individual asks Sigma to include with the information a statement claiming that the information is not accurate, complete or up to date, Sigma will take reasonable steps to do so. 

7.7 Sigma will provide reasons for denial of access or a refusal to correct personal information.

(d) the use or disclosure is necessary for Sigma to fulfil its obligations to the agency; or

10\. Transborder data flows  
Sigma will only transfer personal information about an individual to someone (other than the organisation or the individual) who is in a foreign country if:

(a) the individual has consented; 

(b) the collection is required by law; 

(c) the collection is necessary to prevent or lessen a serious and imminent threat to the life or health of any individual, where the individual whom the information concerns:

(i) is physically or legally incapable of giving consent to the collection; or

(ii) physically cannot communicate consent to the collection; or

(d) the collection is necessary for the establishment, exercise or defence of a legal or equitable claim.

11.2 Despite subclause 11.1, Sigma may collect health information about an individual if:

(a) the information is necessary to provide a health service to the individual; and

(b) the information is collected:

(i) as required by law (other than this Act); or

(ii) in accordance with rules established by competent health or medical bodies that deal with obligations of professional confidentiality which bind the organisation.

collection; and

11.4 If Sigma collects health information about an individual in accordance with subclause 11.3, it will take reasonable steps to permanently de-identify the information before it discloses it.

12\. Requests for information

12.1 Sigma will provide an individual with access to information which is held about them. The nature and timing of access will be agreed between Sigma and the individual.

12.2 A request for access to personal information must be in writing, specify the information sought and may be made to an individual’s usual contact at Sigma or the Privacy Officer.
