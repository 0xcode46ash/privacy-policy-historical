II. Membership and Participation Eligibility

You must be thirteen years of age or older to be a member of our website and receive membership benefits, such as our newsletter. We will not accept membership registrations from visitors under the age of thirteen. To participate in contests, sweepstakes and/or special events, you must meet the designated minimum age requirements (for example, eighteen years of age or older) that will be required for the specific contest, sweepstakes and/or event. You do not have to be a member to participate in certain website activities such as contests, sweepstakes and/or special events. We will establish specific rules and terms for participation in each contest, sweepstakes and/or special event and will prominently post this information on our website. We will not knowingly collect personal information from children under thirteen years of age for activities on our website that require the submission of such information. Upon discovery of the participation of a person under thirteen years of age in such activities, his/her registration or participation will be canceled immediately and all personal information will be deleted from our files.

For website activities that request personal information, you agree to provide accurate and current information about yourself. Your membership and/or participation in our website activities will be canceled without notice if at any time we discover that you provide false information, or violate any term of this Privacy Policy or our Terms of Usage Agreement. If necessary, and in accordance with applicable law, AMCC will cooperate with local, state and/or federal authorities to protect its website visitors, parents, partners, affiliates, subsidiaries and operational providers or to prevent unauthorized use of the site.

We will also cancel your membership and delete your membership profile, to the extent allowed by law, if your e-mail address is canceled or becomes inactive or inaccessible for an extended period of time. Certain information fields are required and cannot be deleted for security purposes or in accordance with various laws. We encourage you to keep us informed about any changes in your membership, personal contact and e-mail information. You may change, update or delete certain information in your membership file by contacting us via [e-mail](mailto:info@amctv.com) or through the My AMC webpage.

III. Collection of Personal Information

We provide various informative, educational, and entertaining features as part of this website. In providing, operating, and maintaining these features, we collect non-personal and personal information for specific purposes. We retain personal information for an indefinite amount of time to preserve our membership database and to comply with various federal and state laws. For example, we are required by various state laws to keep certain information on contest or sweepstakes entries for an extended period of time following the event.

IV. Registration for Participation in Website Activities and Services

Use and Collection of Information by AMCC

To participate as a member of our website, you may be required to provide personal information such as your name, home and e-mail addresses, telephone number, birth date and gender. To participate in contests, sweepstakes, and/or special events, visitors are required to provide the same types of personal information, depending on the specific activity. We may also survey visitors about various topics, including their television viewing preferences and comments about how we can improve our programming, website, and services to you. Response to our surveys is entirely voluntary.

We collect personal information for several important purposes, including to protect the security of our visitors and the site, and to make our program service and website a better experience for our visitors. We will use personal information to distribute our newsletter and notify the winners of our contests and sweepstakes. Information provided by our visitors may also be used for future marketing and/or promotional use about our program service or website.

The only personal information this website obtains about you is information voluntarily provided by you. We do not collect additional personal information about individual visitors or members from other sources. This means that a person can visit our website and navigate through the site without giving us personal information. To gauge the effectiveness of our website, we do collect non-personal information about our members and visitors such as Internet server and browser identification. Our webservers automatically recognize the Internet service provider, the webpage from which a person enters our site, and how much time the visitor spends on each page. This information does not reveal a visitor's personal identity. We collect and review this information and use it to evaluate and improve the content and functionality of our website.

Our contests, sweepstakes, and special events are often produced with the generous support of non-affiliated sponsors and/or promotional partners. The personal information collected by our website in conjunction with such events may also be used for the marketing of additional services and events by AMCC, and/or its promotional partners and sponsors beyond the contest, sweepstakes and/or special event. Depending on the occasion, visitors will be able to either grant their approval on how their personal information will be used before it is collected ("opt-in"), or choose to deny use of their information for additional purposes ("opt-out"). Prior to the commencement of each contest, sweepstakes, and/or special event, we will prominently post on the website applicable rules, terms and conditions, and if necessary, any supplemental privacy provisions that will inform our visitors about how their personal information will be collected, used and disclosed.

Use and Collection of Information by Contract Service and Operational Providers

For the convenience of our visitors, we will provide the opportunity to purchase AMC-related goods, merchandise and services through this website. Companies not affiliated, owned or operated by AMCC, its parents, affiliates or subsidiaries will handle some of these transactions. For example, MediaBay.com ("MediaBay") and Publisher's Creative Systems ("PCS") are currently our operational providers and/or order fulfillment companies. We require PCS to adhere to the provisions in AMCC's privacy policy. We prohibit PCS from sharing our visitors' personal information with parties other than AMCC and require that PCS only use the personal information for the purpose of conducting the sale of AMC-related merchandise.

In contrast, MediaBay, as an independent company selling its own goods and merchandise sporting the AMC logo, has its own privacy policy and may share visitors' personal information with companies other than AMCC, unless you request otherwise. Please be advised that when you visit MediaBay's website you will be subject to [the privacy policy and terms of usage agreement of MediaBay](http://www.mediabay.com/company/privacy.asp) and you must inform it whether you want it to use or share your personal information for purposes other than the processing and fulfillment of your order.

We may conduct online auctions in conjunction with the American Movie Classics program service. The online auction will be managed and produced by ibidlive.com ("ibidlive"), which is not affiliated, owned or operated by AMCC, its parents, affiliates or subsidiaries. We prohibit ibidlive from sharing our visitors' personal information with parties outside of AMCC and require that ibidlive only use the personal information for the purpose of conducting the auction and fulfillment.

Use and Collection of Information by Advertisers and Sponsors

Our website will post banner and other forms of advertisements, and/or links to the websites of advertisers, which are companies that are not owned or operated by AMCC, its parents, affiliates or subsidiaries. Our website will also post advertisements and/or links to the website of sponsors, which are companies that are not owned or operated by AMCC, its parents, affiliates or subsidiaries. These advertisers and sponsors may independently solicit and collect personal information, or send their own cookies to our visitors. Please be advised that when you visit an advertiser's or sponsor's website you will be subject to the privacy policy and terms of usage agreement of that website. Visitors must consider whether or not to provide personal information given that website's collection, use and disclosure practices. AMCC, its parents, partners, affiliates or subsidiaries, will not be responsible for the content, activities, information collection, use and disclosure practices of the websites of advertisers and sponsors.

V. Our Policy on Disclosing Your Information to Parties

Other than AMCC We will not sell, rent, exchange or share your personal information with companies other than AMCC unless we receive your permission first, it is required by law, or disclosure is necessary to operate the website and protect the safety of our visitors, employees or property. When visitors send an e-mail to us, we will protect your e-mail address and other personal contact information. However, we may disclose the content of your e-mail to other persons. Please see our Terms of Usage Agreement. We will share your personal information with those persons or companies who provide support for the internal operations of the website and our agents, such as contest fulfillment services, maintenance and technical services, and e-commerce and auction contractors ("contract service and operational providers"). If you are purchasing goods, merchandise or services on this website and use a credit card to complete the transaction, our operational providers may share your personal information and credit card number with a ticket agent, a credit card processing and/or a shipping/fulfillment company in order to complete your order.

AMCC is majority-owned by Cablevision Systems Corporation ("Cablevision") and we may in the future share information with Cablevision and its affiliates. If and when we have made such sharing arrangements, we will disclose who those affiliates are in our Privacy Policy that will notify our visitors of their options at that time. The American Movie Classics program service or website may conduct joint activities with other Cablevision affiliates, but we will not share personal information about individual visitors without providing notice though changes in our Privacy Policy.

We may provide aggregate information about our visitors to our advertisers, sponsors, promotional partners, and affiliates, such as how many persons visited a particular page or activity, the average age of our visitors on site or page, or the likes and dislikes of our visitors, but this information does not include personal information about any individual visitor. We may obtain geographic information such as zip code clustering from other sources, but this aggregate information will not reveal any personal information about a specific visitor.

VI. How To Add, Change, or Delete Personal Information

You will have access to your membership profile collected and maintained by our website. We strive to ensure that the information we obtain and use about our members and visitors is accurate. Therefore, you may add, change or delete personal information on your profile or registration for other activities. Certain information fields are required and cannot be deleted for security purposes or in accordance with various laws. We encourage you to keep us informed about any changes in your membership information and e-mail address. You may change, update or delete certain information in your membership file by contacting us via [e-mail](mailto:info@amctv.com) or through the My AMC webpage.

VII. Use of Cookies and Tracking Devices

This site will use cookies or other tracking devices. A cookie is a small data file that contains a unique identification number that a website places on your hard drive when you visit a site. The "cookie" is able to store information such as data about your computer, the type of browser you use, and how many times your computer visits a certain site. Cookies do not allow the website to access personal information that you haven't already provided. Cookies enable us to track the number of contest and promotion entries, how often visitors are visiting our website and specific pages, estimate the audience size for sponsors and advertisers, and to track user preferences. You can refuse to use cookies by turning them off in your browser. Please contact your software manufacturer for questions on how to disable your cookies. You do not need to have cookies turned on to use most of this site. However, you may find that some areas on the website will be slower, or may not function at all, and you may not be able to participate in certain activities such as contests or sweepstakes if the cookies are disabled.

VIII. Our Security Procedures

We are committed to safeguarding the privacy of all visitors. We require our employees to protect the privacy of all information collected over our website. Only employees and supervisors with specific authorization have access to databases containing visitors' personal information. The databases are protected in a secure facility. Credit card information is transmitted via encrypted technology.

We also require our contract service and operational providers that process subscriptions, orders for goods, merchandise and services, and conduct auctions to maintain the security and integrity of personal information collected over our website or from our visitors. These providers may not use the collected information for any purpose other than designated in this Privacy Policy or share personal information with parties other than AMCC, unless we have designated otherwise in Section IV. Further, if we decide to share visitor information with Cablevision and its affiliates, the receiving entity will also maintain the security and integrity of personal information collected over our website and follow the same privacy practices established in this Privacy Policy.

Please be advised that once you leave our website, your use of the Internet will be governed by the privacy policies, if any, of the particular website that you are accessing. AMCC is not responsible for the content, activities or privacy practices on the other sites.

IX. Notification of Changes in the Privacy Policy

We will review our security measures and Privacy Policy on a periodic basis and will modify, as AMCC deems appropriate. We may also change or update our Privacy Policy if we add new services or features. However, we will notify our visitors if there are material changes in our use or disclosure practices for personal information by modifying and posting this policy. We also encourage you to check our Privacy Policy on a regular basis.
