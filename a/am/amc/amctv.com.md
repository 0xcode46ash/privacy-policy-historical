##### Use and Collection of Information by Contract Service and Operational Providers

For the convenience of our visitors, we will provide the opportunity to purchase AMC-related goods, merchandise and services through this website. Companies not affiliated, owned or operated by AMCC, its parents, or subsidiaries will handle some of these transactions. We call these companies that conduct our e-commerce operations and/or order fulfillment "Operational Providers." If you choose to use these optional services, our Operational Providers will request your personal information to fulfill your order or request. The voluntary submission of your personal information to these Operational Providers, including your order or request, will be governed by the specific provider's terms of usage and privacy policies. To facilitate an order or request, we may share your personal information with the provider. The Operational Provider may also share your personal information with us.

In most instances, we request that our Operational Providers adhere to the provisions in this Privacy Policy and that such providers only share visitors' personal information with AMCC, unless necessary to complete a visitor's request or order. We also request that these providers only use the personal information for the purpose of conducting the sale or fulfilling the requested order. However, you must read an Operational Provider's privacy policy to determine the extent of use and disclosure of your personal information collected online. AMCC, its parents, partners, members affiliates and subsidiaries are not responsible for the collection, use and disclosure practices of Operational Providers, nor are they responsible or liable for the products or services offered and/or provided by Operational Providers.

V. Use of Cookies and Tracking Devices
    

This website uses cookies or other tracking devices. A cookie is a small data file that contains a unique identification number that a website places on your hard drive when you visit a website. The "cookie" is able to store information such as data about your computer, the type of browser you use, and how many times your computer visits a certain website. Cookies do not allow the website to access personal information that you have not already provided. Cookies enable us to track the number of contest and promotion entries, how often visitors are visiting our website and specific website pages, estimate the audience size for sponsors and advertisers, and to track user preferences. You can refuse to use cookies by turning them off in your browser. Please contact your software manufacturer for questions on how to disable your cookies. You do not need to have cookies turned on to use most of this website. However, you may find that some areas on the website will be slower, may not function at all, or you may not be able to participate in certain activities such as contests or sweepstakes if the cookies are disabled.

This website may use clear Graphic Interchange Formats "("GIFs" (also known as pixel tags, web beacons or web bugs). A clear GIF is a tiny line of code that is programmed to collect certain information about a visit to a particular website or website page. We may use GIFs to gather non-personal, aggregate information on visits to our website and track usage of website links. Although we do not intend to use GIFs to collect personal information, some personal information you provide over our website may be linked to non-personal information collected through GIFs. We do not disclose this combined information to third parties. (However, please note that personal information not combined with GIF or other tracking data may be disclosed in accordance with this policy.) Other websites may also use clear GIFs.

AMCC, its parents and subsidiaries are not responsible for the use of clear GIFs by other website operators. Visitors must review other website operators' privacy policies to determine the type and extent of tracking device use.

VI. Use and Collection of Information by Advertisers and Sponsors
    

Our website will post banner ads and other forms of advertisements, and/or links to the websites of advertisers or sponsors which are companies that are not owned or operated by AMCC, its parents or subsidiaries. These advertisers and sponsors may independently solicit and collect personal information, or send their own cookies to our visitors. Please be advised that when you visit an advertiser's or sponsor's website you will be subject to the privacy policy and terms of usage agreement of that website operator. AMCC, its parents, partners, members, affiliates or subsidiaries, will not be responsible for advertiser or sponsor ads and/or links or the content, activities, information collection, use and disclosure practices of the websites of advertisers and sponsors.

VII. Our Policy on Disclosing Your Information to Parties
    

Other than AMCC, we only share or disclose your personal information with third parties when you consent to the disclosure, when disclosure is required or authorized by law, when it is necessary to operate the website or our website services, to provide or enhance our website features, complete requested transactions, protect the safety of our visitors, employees or property, when disclosure is consistent with AMCC practices for services that are similarly provided offline, or as otherwise provided in this Privacy Policy. For example, AMCC currently combines personal information from online magazine subscriptions with the information from offline magazine subscriptions. We may share or rent this information with other entities for various purposes. Visitors placing online magazine subscriptions who do not want their personal information shared with other entities may be able to either grant their approval on how their personal information will be used before it is collected ("opt-in"), or choose to deny use of their information for additional purposes ("opt-out").

AMCC is majority-owned by Cablevision Systems Corporation ("Cablevision") and we may in the future share personal information with Cablevision, its affiliates or other entities for other purposes. If we decide in the future to enter into such sharing arrangements, we will disclose in this Privacy Policy the type of personal information that will be shared, the reason we are sharing the information, and how to contact us if you do not want us to share your personal information ("opt-out"). We currently conduct joint activities with members of the Cablevision family; however, we will not share individual visitor's personal information with these entities unless we provide notice in this Privacy Policy. In the event of a sale or transfer of AMCC and/or its assets, including database information, personal information may be transferred to other third parties. The recipient of this information may have privacy policies that differ from those in this policy.

When visitors send an e-mail to us, we will protect the e-mail address and other personal contact information. However, we may disclose the content of your e-mail to other persons. Please see our [Terms of Usage Agreement](https://web.archive.org/terms.html). We may share your personal information with our Operational Providers or those persons, companies or agents who provide support for the internal operations of the website, such as contest fulfillment services, maintenance and technical services, and e-commerce and auction contractors. If you are purchasing goods, merchandise or services on this website and use a credit card to complete the transaction, our Operational Providers may share your personal information and credit card number with a ticket agent, a credit card processing and/or a shipping/fulfillment company in order to complete your order.

We may provide aggregate information about our visitors to our advertisers, sponsors, promotional partners, and affiliates, such as how many persons visited a particular page or activity, the average age of our visitors on the website or page, or the likes and dislikes of our visitors, but this information does not include personal information about any individual visitor. We may obtain geographic information such as zip code clustering from other sources, but this aggregate information will not reveal any personal information about a specific visitor.

CHILDREN'S PRIVACY POLICY
    

AMCC respects the privacy of your child and we want to share with you our policies regarding children under the age of thirteen. We also offer parents and guardians additional guidelines to help keep your child's personal information safe and your family's Internet participation enjoyable.

We have developed this website to appeal to visitors over the age of thirteen. Although visitors of all ages may navigate through our website, we do not knowingly collect personal information from persons under the age of thirteen. If upon notification by a parent or guardian, or discovery by other means, that we have improperly collected personal information from a child under thirteen or that such child has improperly registered n this website by using false information, we will immediately cancel the child's membership and/or participation, and delete the child's personal information, user name and password from our records.

If we decide to request information from children, we will require verifiable parental consent before we collect any personal information from children under thirteen years of age, except in the following circumstances allowed by law:

  * To provide notice and get consent from a parent or guardian;
  * To respond to a one-time request from a child, after which we will immediately delete the child's information;
  * To fulfill a child's request for a subscription to a online newspaper, magazine or specific information on a regular basis and we will notify the parent or guardian before we contact the child again;
  * To protect the safety of a child who is participating on this website; and
  * To protect the security or integrity of the website, to take precautions against liability, to respond to a validly executed subpoena or warrant from law enforcement, or if permitted under other provisions of law.
