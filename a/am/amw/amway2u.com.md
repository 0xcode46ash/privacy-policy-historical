**1.     ****General**

******How WE COLLECT PERSONAL DatA**

We collect Personal Data from you in various ways and at several different points. We may collect your Personal Data on one of our web sites, by telephone, facsimile, when you complete and submit an application form to become a Distributor.  
Wherever possible we collect Personal Data directly from you. There may, however, be occasions where we collect your Personal Data from someone else. For example, where you make an application in joint names. 

If you provide Personal Data to us about another person, we rely on you to have made, or make them aware that you will, or may, provide their information to us and the kinds of third parties we may provide it to and the relevant purposes we and the third parties will use it for and how they can access it. If you have not done, or will not do these things, you must tell us before you provide the relevant Personal Data. 

We may share the Personal Data you provide through the various means above with other Amway- related entities and/or trusted business partners with whom we collaborate, as well as those that provide services to our Site. Where we engage non-affiliated third-party agents or contractors, we require them also to observe the intent of this Privacy Policy.

From time to time, we may provide Personal Data in response to court order, subpoena, or government investigation. We also reserve the right to report to law enforcement agencies any activities that we in good faith believe to be unlawful. We may release Personal Data when we believe that such release is reasonably necessary to enforce or apply our Terms of Use or to protect the rights, property, and safety of others and ourselves.

Should Amway (Malaysia) Sdn Bhd or its related entities merge with or be acquired by another business entity, or its respective assets be acquired, you should expect that we would share some or all of your Personal Data to companies assuming the role of serving you and other users of our Site.

**2.     ****Distributors**

If you are a Distributor, you will receive advice and information from your own personal business advisory team and support network consisting of your sponsoring Distributor and upline organisation. To allow such communication, we may share your contact information with your sponsoring Distributor  and upline organisation. They have agreed not to share your information with any non-affiliated third parties, and are obligated to observe the intent of this Privacy Policy. In the ordinary course of supporting your business, information about you and your orders might be shared with your sponsoring Distributor  and immediate upline Distributor. You have the opportunity to let us know, however, if you do not want any Personally Identifiable Information shared beyond your immediate upline Distributor.

**3.     ****Your Choices**

      Your permission is always secured first. We will not use or share the Personal Data collected in ways unrelated to the purpose for which you provided the information, including those described above, without providing you a choice whether to permit any such unrelated uses.

**4.    Accessing and Correcting Your Information**

We take reasonable measures to ensure that any Personal Data we collect is accurate, current, complete, and reliable for its intended use. If you wish to update or otherwise correct Personal Data you have provided to us, you may edit your information online after completing registration, or contact us as described in the "Contact Us" section, below, and we will assist you. ****
