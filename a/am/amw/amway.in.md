**_What Information We Collect and How We Use It_** __

  
Any information we collect on our Site generally falls into the following two categories: Personally Identifiable Information and Aggregate Information. 

**Personally Identifiable Information:**

This refers to information that lets us know specifically who you are. In general, you can visit our Site without telling us who you are or revealing any Personally Identifiable Information. You may however, voluntarily provide Personally Identifiable Information (such as name, e-mail address, and country of origin) for us to contact you, including via e-mail, to respond to your comments or inquiries. In such event, we might maintain a record or your contact, including such Personally Identifiable Information, in a file specific to you. We use this information to provide better service incase you contact us again.

**Aggregate Information:**

This refers to information that does not by itself identify you as a specific individual. Such information would include the Uniform Resource Locator ("URL") or the Web site that referred you to our Site, your Internet Protocol ("IP") address (a number automatically assigned to your computer whenever you surf the Web), your operating system and browser type, and any search terms that you enter on our Site. Our Web server aggregates this information in order to monitor the level of activity on our Site, evaluate its effectiveness, and improve the content of our Site in order to make your visit an easy and enjoyable experience.
