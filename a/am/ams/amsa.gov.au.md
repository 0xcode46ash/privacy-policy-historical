This privacy statement generally applies to the whole of AMSA’s website. However, please note that some pages have their own privacy statements (for example our [social media](https://web.archive.org/web/20131223071317id_/http%3A//media/social-media/index.asp#privacy) pages) because of their specific purpose and when accessing those pages the privacy provisions provided there will apply.
