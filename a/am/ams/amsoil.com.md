# AMSOIL Corporate Website - Online Privacy Policy

**AMSOIL Online Privacy Policy**

AMSOIL INC. is sensitive to privacy issues on the Internet. We believe it is important for you to know how we treat the information that we receive about you while you're visiting our site.

In general, you can visit AMSOIL INC. on the World Wide Web without telling us who you are or revealing any personal information about yourself. Our web servers collect the IP addresses, not the e-mail addresses, of visitors. This information is used to measure the number of visits, average time spent on the site, pages viewed, etc. AMSOIL INC. uses this information to measure the use of our site and to improve the content presented within.

There are times, however, when we may need information from you, such as your name and address. When information is needed, we will try to let you know at the time of collection how we will use the personal information. Usually, the personal information we collect is used only by us to respond to your inquiry, process an order or allow you to access specific account information. We also ask for your name and address information when you inquire about becoming an AMSOIL Dealer or Commercial or Retail Account.  We **do not** provide any of this information to outside sources for any reason.

If you ever receive an e-mail from AMSOIL INC. asking for your name, username or password for any secured areas of the AMSOIL INC. website, only respond if you already submitted information to AMSOIL INC. and make sure that the e-mail that you receive is from an AMSOIL INC. Corporate Staff Member. In general, this applies to anyone who has contacted you with an e-mail address that corresponds to the "@amsoil.com" domain. Some of these addresses include:

If anyone asks you for usernames or passwords, and they don't seem to originate from AMSOIL INC., do not reply.  Check first with [webmaster@amsoil.com](mailto:webmaster@amsoil.com) to verify that the person or persons are from AMSOIL INC. and that they are asking for legitimate information. This policy ensures that confidential information is not given out that may compromise privacy for you or other AMSOIL Dealers.

If you arrived at the AMSOIL Corporate Website via an Authorized AMSOIL Dealer website, a special tag called a "cookie" may have been used to provide AMSOIL with the account number of that Dealer (a cookie is a tiny element of data that a Web site can send to your browser). You may set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie. This cookie expires as soon as you close your browser.

When you use and submit a credit card for an AMSOIL Online Store transaction, your credit card information is **not** saved.  AMSOIL INC. does not maintain permanent or temporary credit card information on our Internet server.  All AMSOIL Online Store transactions are encrypted using [ Verisign](http://www.verisign.com/) encryption technology and travel over a Secure Socket Layer (SSL) server.

AMSOIL INC.'s Corporate Website may contain links to other sites such as corporate racing sponsorships and AMSOIL racing partnerships and racing organizations. While we try to link only to sites that share our high standards and respect for privacy, we are **not** responsible for the content or the privacy practices employed by other sites.

As always, if you have any questions regarding your privacy while visiting our site, please direct your inquiries to [webmaster@amsoil.com](mailto:webmaster@amsoil.com).
