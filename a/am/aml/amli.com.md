Thank you for visiting the AMLI Residential (“ **AMLI** ”) website (including any AMLI-branded and affiliated websites that are both directly linked from this website and display a link to this Privacy Policy, the “ **Websites** ”). Your privacy is important to us. To help you better understand our privacy practices, we provide this Privacy Policy, which explains our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used. 

We may change this Privacy Policy at any time without prior notice to you or any other person (via email or otherwise), by posting changes on the Websites. We encourage you to check back and review this Privacy Policy from time to time to remain fully informed of our commitments. The amended Privacy Policy will be effective upon posting on the Websites, so when you use the Websites or provide us with Personal Information (as defined below), you indicate your consent to this Privacy Policy as modified from time to time, including your consent to our (and third parties on our behalf) collection and use of Personal Information. This Privacy Policy describes our privacy practices regarding information collected from you, or that you provide to us or third parties on our behalf, including, but not limited to, through the Websites. If you do not agree to the revised Privacy Policy, you are not authorized to access or use the Websites and you must disconnect from and not use the Websites.

We automatically track and collect general log information when you visit the Websites, including your: (i) IP address; (ii) domain server; (iii) operating system; and (iv) type of web browser as well as the pages you visit on the Websites (collectively, “Traffic Data”). Traffic Data may not personally identify you, but is helpful for marketing purposes and for improving your experience on the Websites.

  * to learn of any possible performance problems on the Websites.



We may collect Traffic Data through various methods including, but not limited to, cookies (which are text files sent to your web browser and stored on your hard disk, to enable us to provide you with a more individualized experience on the Websites and delivery of information), IP addresses, and transparent GIFs or pixel tags (which are small graphic files that allow us to monitor the use of the Websites and our email communications).
