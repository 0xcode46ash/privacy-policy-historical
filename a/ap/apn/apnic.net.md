# APNIC - APNIC Privacy Statement

## How your personal information is collected and used

APNIC collects personal information for the following main purposes:

  * To support Internet resource requests
  * For account and billing purposes
  * To administer conferences, meetings, training events, and other communication activities (such as mailing lists)
  * To monitor network performance
  * For recruitment



Each of these purposes is described below.

2.1. **Data used to support resource requests**

Internet addresses are public resources. To ensure that these resources are managed responsibly, the APNIC Secretariat must collect a range of information including:

  * Documentation of network infrastructure, plans, and customer details, which demonstrate the need for addresses requested; and
  * Personal information and proof of identity for people authorized by an organization to request resources and maintain database entries.



The APNIC Secretariat collects such information via web forms, on either the main APNIC web site or the MyAPNIC web site; from general correspondence by phone, email, post, and fax; and from face-to-face meetings.

The APNIC Secretariat uses this information to evaluate resource requests and administer accounts. It also may store some or all of this information for archival purposes, for the purposes of validating or auditing resource allocations in future.

Some of the personal information you provide may be publicly registered in the APNIC Whois Database. This is limited to contact details relating to the allocation of specific public Internet resources.

Please note that in relation to these network contact details, the APNIC Whois Database allows organizations to register "role objects" in place of personal details.

Also, APNIC policies allow for resource holders to choose whether their assignment details should be publicly visible.

2.2. **Data used for account and billing purposes**

The APNIC Secretariat collects organizational and personal information, including banking details, for billing and account administration purposes.

All APNIC Members are required to provide an email address that will be included on a mailing list for membership-related announcements. This does not need to be a personal email address.

The APNIC Secretariat does publish the names and URLs of APNIC Member organizations on the APNIC website, but does not publish personal details relating to those Members.

2.3. **Data used for conferences, meetings, training, and communication activities**

In order to administer conferences, meetings, training sessions, and public discussion lists, it is necessary for the APNIC Secretariat to use registration forms and voluntary subscription procedures to collect the required information.

The information gathered by registration forms is used to help plan and conduct public conferences, meetings, and training sessions. The APNIC Secretariat archives registration details to help plan future events and develop services.

The information gathered by subscription procedures is used only in the mailing lists you specify and may be visible to other list members. The APNIC Secretariat provides simple online tools to allow you to manage your own subscription status on mailing lists.

Certain events such as APNIC Conferences require photography and videography and such media may be used in APNIC publications, on the APNIC website, or on social media platforms. APNIC takes all care to inform event attendees that photography and videography make take place.

2.4. **Data used to monitor network performance**

The APNIC Secretariat logs certain technical data from visits to APNIC web sites in order to analyse how the online services are used and how they perform. This is needed to maintain and develop services.

No attempt is made to personally identify people who browse these web sites, or build profiles of their browsing patterns.

In cases where APNIC's online services are abused or attacked, the APNIC Secretariat may use the logged information to investigate the incidents or to deny further access to those responsible.

APNIC does use "cookies". A cookie is a small file that asks permission to be placed on your computer's hard drive. If you agree, the file is added and the cookie helps analyse Web traffic or assist with the provision of services.

You can choose to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser settings to decline cookies if you prefer. If you set your browser to warn you before accepting cookies, you will receive a warning message with each cookie. If you set your browser to reject cookies you may not be able to use some APNIC services.

2.5. **Data used for recruitment**

You can update your personal information, or gain access to it at a mutually convenient time, by sending a written request to [hr@apnic.net](mailto:hr@apnic.net).

2.6. **Disclosure required by law or by enforcement bodies**

APNIC may also disclose personal information about you if such disclosure is:

  * Reasonably necessary for one or more enforcement activities conducted by, or on behalf of, an enforcement body; or
  * Specifically permitted under the circumstances described in the Privacy Act 1988.
