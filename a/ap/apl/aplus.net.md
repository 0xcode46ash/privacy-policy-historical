The AAA Rules are available on the AAA’s website www.adr.org, or by calling the AAA at (800) 778-7879. You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in the county where you live or at another mutually agreed location. 
  6. _Arbitration Fees and Payments._   Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA’s applicable rules, however Deluxe will reimburse those fees to you in an amount up to $25,000 (though, in no event will Deluxe pay any attorneys’ fees and/or costs you may incur). Deluxe also waives its own right to seek attorneys’ fees and costs in arbitration.
  7. _Right to Opt-out._ You may opt out of this arbitration agreement by notifying Deluxe in writing no later than 30 days after first becoming subject to this arbitration agreement. Your notice must include your name and address, any additional customer information, and an unequivocal statement that you want to opt out of this arbitration agreement. You must either mail your opt-out notice to this address: Deluxe Small Business Sales, Inc., ATTN: Arbitration Opt-out/Privacy Program Office, 3680 Victoria Street N., Shoreview, MN 55126 United States of America, or email the opt-out notice privacyprogramoffice@deluxe.com. You also may reject any changes we make to this arbitration agreement in later versions of these Terms by sending Deluxe notice within 30 days of your notice of the change. If you do, the most recent version of the arbitration agreement to which you agreed before the change you rejected will apply.
  8. _Small Claims Court._ Notwithstanding the foregoing, either you or Deluxe may bring an individual action in small claims court in your county of residence or in Shoreview, Minnesota, if you meet the court’s requirements.
  9. _Severability._ If the class action waiver is found to be illegal or unenforceable as to all or some parts of a dispute, then those parts will not be arbitrated but will proceed in court, with the rest of the dispute proceeding in arbitration.
  10. _Arbitration Agreement Survival._ This arbitration agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with Deluxe.

We reserve the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time. If we decide to change our Privacy Policy, we will prominently post those changes here and any other place we deem appropriate, so you are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If we make any material changes, we will notify you by way of an email (sent to the email address associated with your account) or by means of a notice on this site prior to the change becoming effective. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected.

We use a self-assessment approach to address compliance with this Privacy Policy, verifying periodically that the policy is accurate, comprehensive, and addresses the privacy requirements applicable to the markets we serve. Periodically, our operations and business practices are reviewed for compliance with corporate policies and procedures governing the confidentiality of information. These reviews are conducted by internal staff who report directly to the Deluxe Board of Directors, external auditing and accounting firms, and government regulators.

We maintain self-assessment procedures to verify our commitment to adhere to Privacy Shield Principles, including ensuring appropriate contract obligations with third parties and service providers acting on our behalf to deliver the requested services.
