# Privacy Policy

  
APL Limited and its affiliates ("APL" or "we" or "our") are committed to maintaining the privacy of users who access our Web site (the "Site"). This Privacy Policy Statement (the "Privacy Policy") explains the types of information we gather and what we do with it. By using the Site, you agree to the terms and policies described in this Privacy Policy.

**1\. Information Collected on the Site**   
APL does not request or require any information from anonymous visitors to the Site. APL collects information only from those users who wish to conduct business transactions (i.e. buy or sell products or services) on the Site and who have registered on the Site ("Registered Users"). When you become a Registered User of HomePort, you provide your name, address, telephone and fax number, e-mail address and a unique User id. 

APL needs the information Registered Users supply for (a) personal identification, (b) to allow us to contact you for customer service, if necessary, (c) to make improvements to HomePort and to the Site, and (d) to enable Registered Users to track shipments, view outstanding charges payable to APL and obtain other user-specific information. Your e-mail address is collected to send you an e-mail message confirming your new member registration as well as confirmations for other services you transact with APL on-line. In addition, APL may use such information (i) for demographic profiling, ad targeting, statistical analysis, to conduct surveys and similar marketing activities; (ii) to notify Registered Users about important changes to the Site or promotions or opportunities; and (iii) to investigate violations of either its Privacy Policy or its "Terms of Use." You may always decline to receive these messages by following the process to Opt Out as described below.

APL will deactivate accounts of Registered Users that have been inactive for an extended period of time. 

Registered Users may access and change their information at any time via the Site.

**2\. Use of Cookies and Log Files**  
The Site does not use persistent or stored cookies; however, it does use temporary or per-session cookies. Temporary or per-session cookies act as a randomly generated session ID; they last only while the Registered User is logged onto the Web site, and are cancelled at the end of the session (i.e., the Registered User logs out of the Site or closes their Web browser program). The Site uses temporary cookies for security purposes. Each time a Registered User logs onto the Site, the Site server generates a temporary session ID, which it associates with the user's login name, password and computer during that particular session. This allows the Registered User to move from page to page in the Site during a specific session, without having to re-enter the user login name and/or password. The temporary cookie allows the Site server to continuously verify that the user is a permitted user as the user moves from page to page during a specific session. When the Registered User logs out of the Site the temporary session ID is cancelled, and is removed from the temporary memory of the user's computer; and the association in the Site server between the temporary session ID and the specific user login name and password is also terminated.

APL also uses log files for anonymous site usage analysis. A "log file" is a data file that records a Registered User's activity while using the Site.

**3\. Security**  
APL stores information received from Registered Users on secure computers. Only a small number of APL employees and/or contractors of APL have physical access to these computers. APL uses firewalls and other security technology to prevent APL computers from being accessed by unauthorized persons.

While APL has taken measures to protect Registered Users' information, please know that (i) no computer system is immune from intrusion; and (ii) information transmitted to the Site may need to pass through many systems in order to process such information. Therefore, APL cannot guarantee the absolute security or confidentiality of information transmitted to the Site.

**4\. Provision of Information to Others**  
APL does not provide information supplied by users to any third parties, except where law, court order, or governmental authority requires or based upon the good faith belief that disclosure is necessary including, without limitation, to protect the rights of APL when we have reason to believe that disclosing the information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing interference with our rights or causing harm to third parties. Occasionally, APL will retain a third party to act on our behalf for the purpose of performing certain services and will provide information to these third parties specifically for use in connection with these services. The information we provide to such third parties is protected by confidentiality agreements and is to be used solely for the performance of the services.

**5\. Links to Other Sites**  
The Site may contain links to Web sites other than our own and for which we are not responsible. These Web sites may send their own cookies to you, and may collect information and use it in a way inconsistent with our Privacy Policy. Unless APL explicitly states otherwise, such references in no way indicate our endorsement, recommendation or preference of any such products, services or information contained on any other site.

**6\. Additional Information**  
APL may alter, update or otherwise change this Privacy Policy at any time to reflect material changes in the way APL uses your information. Any such changes will be posted on this page. Your continued use of the Site following the posting of such changes will indicate your full acceptance of those changes.

**7\. Opt Out Policy**   
At anytime, you can unsubscribe to HomePort or as a Registered User of the Site by sending an e-mail to [homeport@apl.com](mailto:homeport@apl.com). As a Registered User, you will occasionally receive e-mail messages from us as described in Section 1 above. If you would prefer not to receive these messages you may opt out by following the instructions within the e-mail message or by contacting us at [homeport@apl.com](mailto:homeport@apl.com). APL reserves the right to limit certain services to Registered Users who will accept e-mail messages.
