Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy, we provide this notice explaining our current online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used. To make this notice easy to find, we make it available on our homepage.

What We Will NOT Do With Your Personal Information  
Aplia will NOT do the following with your personal information:

  * We will NOT sell your personal information, such as your name, email address or street address, to third parties.
  * We will NOT use your email address to send you marketing materials.

When We Collect Your Personal Information  
You are required to register with us before you can gain access to the course sections of our website. During registration you are required to give your name and email address. It is only necessary for you to register once.

When you purchase a product or service, we collect your contact information (such as your address) and financial information (such as your credit/debit card information). We use the information you provide only to complete that product order or fulfill the service. We do not share this information with unaffiliated parties except to the extent necessary to complete that transaction. If we have trouble processing an order, we use the information to contact you.

When you enroll in a course, we may ask you to provide your student identification number for that course. We only ask for your student ID when your teacher has instructed us to do so. You have the option to not provide your student ID; however, not providing it may affect your teacher's ability to determine your grades.

* * *

Why We Need Your Personal Information  
Your personal information is used **only** for the following purposes:

  * Your email address and password will be used to identify you as an authorized user of our services.
  * Your name may be used to identify you when you participate in an Aplia multi-user interactive experiment, simulation, chat session, email exchange or bulletin board.
  * Your email address may be used to send you your password if you forget it.
  * Your email address may be used to contact you about site and service announcement updates. You are not able to unsubscribe from service announcements, which contain important information about the service.
  * The contact and financial information you provide when you purchase a product or service will be used to complete that product order or fulfill the service.
  * All of your personal information will be provided to your Educator for his/her administrative purposes. Generally he/she will use the information for grading and may use your email address to notify you of course issues. Please contact your Educator directly for any further questions relating to his/her use of your personal information.
  * We may also use or disclose information to resolve disputes, investigate problems, or enforce our Terms and Conditions of Use. At times, we may review status and activity of multiple users to do so. We may disclose or access information whenever we believe in good faith that the law so requires or if we otherwise consider it necessary to do so to maintain service and improve our products and services.



* * *

Anonymous Information  
We use non-identifying and aggregate information to better design our service and to share with third parties for the purposes of product development, research or statistical analysis. This is information which does not personally and specifically identify you but is derived from your use of our site. For example, we may tell a researcher that X number of individuals completed an experiment, but we would not disclose any personal information that could be used to identify those individuals.

* * *

Log Files  
We use IP addresses (an identifier for computers on the Internet) to analyze trends, administer the site, gather broad demographic information for aggregate use, and comply with applicable laws. IP addresses are not linked directly to personally identifiable information.
