# Privacy Policy | A Place in the Sun

This site is owned and operated by APITS Ltd. Your privacy on the Internet is of the utmost importance to us and we want to make your experience online satisfying and safe. We gather certain types of information about our users and this privacy policy discloses what information we gather and how we use it. 

### PERSONAL DATA ABOUT YOU (SUPPLIED VOLUNTARILY)

We collect information about our users through e-newsletter subscription. We do not share this information with third parties unless you have specifically requested that we do so, in order that advertisers and/or third parties can offer you information, goods and services that may be of interest to you. 

We may contact you by email with electronic newsletters. The newsletters are sent out to the email address you have supplied. All our email correspondence includes an unsubscribe option at the bottom so you can easily choose to opt out of all further email correspondence. 

#### USAGE TRACKING DATA

We sometimes track user traffic patters throughout our site to determine which parts of the website are being used/not used. This tracking is never associated with individual users. It helps us continue to build a better service for you.

We reserve the right to disclose information about demographics to advertisers, but in anonymous aggregate form only. We will not reveal your personal identity in connection with the disclosure of such information. 

This information is stored by our data processors and us. We may employ external companies to act on our behalf as data processors for internal business purposes. Data processors will abide by the Privacy Policy detailed here and will not disclose personal details to any other organisations or use data other than for purposes required by us.

We may place a text file called a "cookie" in the browser files of your computer. The cookie itself does not contain Personal Information although it will enable us to relate your use of this site to information that you have specifically and knowingly provided. The only personal information a cookie can contain is information you supply yourself. A cookie can't read data off your hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites. We may use cookies to track user traffic patterns (as described above).

You can refuse cookies by turning them off in your browser. You do not need to have cookies turned on to use this site.  
We reserve the right to access and disclose individually identifiable information to comply with applicable laws and lawful government requests, to operate our systems properly and to protect our customers and ourselves. We are not responsible for the content or the privacy policies of publications/other websites other than our own that may be mentioned. 

#### SECURITY

We operate secure data networks protected by industry standard firewall and password protection systems. Our security and privacy policies are periodically reviewed and enhanced as necessary and only authorized individuals have access to the information provided by our customers. 

#### YOUR CONSENT

By using this site, you consent to the collection and use of this information by APITS Ltd. If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on this page so that you are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances we disclose it.
