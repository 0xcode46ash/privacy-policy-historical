Any reference to “you” or “your”, means you as user of the Website.

Galaxy New Media Limited is a joint venture between 4 Ventures Limited (a subsidiary of Channel Four Television Corporation) and Brooklands Group Limited (together, including their holding companies and subsidiaries, "Associates"). We may share information about you with our Associates and will ensure that they adhere to the same level of data protection standards as set out in this Privacy Policy with regards to the data we share with them.

**Our use of your personal information**

Where you make an enquiry about a property listing, personal information (including your contact details and your enquiry) will be sent to the agent or developer who is marketing the property you have enquired about, so they can contact you directly to respond to your enquiry.

**Cookies and other such devices**

Cookies are small pieces of information stored by your browser on your computer's hard drive. We use cookies and other such devices to allow us to understand who has seen which web pages, property listings and advertisements and to determine how frequently particular pages are visited and which are the most popular areas of the Website. We may also compile anonymous and aggregated usage statistics, from which you cannot be identified.

We may also use cookies and other such devices to:

• allow you to carry information across pages of the Website and avoid having to re-enter information;  
• within registration to allow you to access stored information;  
• help us recognise you as a unique visitor when you return to the Website and to allow us to tailor content or advertisements to match your preferred interests or to avoid showing you the same adverts repeatedly; and/or

**Passing on your personal information to third parties**

As mentioned previously, where you have requested us to do so, we will pass your personal information to the agents or developers who are marketing the properties you enquire about.

We may also pass your information to other parties as follows:

• to our employees and agents and those of our Associates, in order to administer the Services provided to you by us now or in the future;   
• some general statistical information about the Website user base, sales patterns, traffic volumes and related matters may be passed on to reputable third parties but these details will not include information personally identifying you; and  
• we may disclose your personal information to the police, regulatory bodies or legal advisers in connection with any alleged criminal offence or suspected breach of the **[Website Terms](https://web.archive.org/terms-and-conditions)** and or the breach of other terms and conditions otherwise relating to you or otherwise where required by law and we will co-operate with any law enforcement authorities or court order requesting or directing us to disclose the identity of or locate anyone breaching the **[Website Terms](https://web.archive.org/terms-and-conditions) **or otherwise for the prevention or detection of crime or the apprehension or prosecution of offenders. 

We do not pass or sell your personal information to third persons for any other purpose than those set out above. Any marketing referred to in the section entitled "How do we use information about you?" is conducted by us on behalf of third parties and they do not have any access to your data unless you yourself choose to contact them.

Where you have registered with us, we will publish your user name on areas of the Website such as discussion boards. You may voluntarily decide to include additional personal information in your public profile which may be viewed by other users of the Website. Always think carefully before deciding what personal information to include in your public profile or post on the Website discussion boards.

**Transfers overseas**

Where you enquire about a property we may need to pass your enquiry and personal information to an estate agent or developer who is located in a country outside the European Economic Area (EEA). Individuals and organisations outside the EEA may not be required to adhere to the same data protection standards as those within the EEA. We will only transfer your enquiry and personal information outside the EEA in these circumstances and only where requested by you.

**Security/how do we protect your information?**

We endeavour to take all reasonable steps to protect you personal information. All personal information collected by us is stored on a secure server. Where possible we use industry-standard technology to allow for the encryption of your personal information.
