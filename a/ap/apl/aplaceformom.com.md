# Privacy Policy | A Place for Mom

## A Place for Mom Privacy Policy

(Effective Date: September 2008)

We have created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our commitment to privacy and so that you may understand the disclosure and collection practices of our Web sites (the "Sites"). We may occasionally update this statement and encourage you to check the date of our privacy statement whenever you visit the Sites to see if it has been modified since your last visit. 

### Collection of Personal Information

For some services provided on our Sites, we may ask you to provide personal information such as name, email address, phone number and zip code. In addition, we may use website analytics tools, or other technologies, like cookies and web beacons, to collect information about your visit to the Sites, including the pages you view, the links you click and other actions taken in connection with the Sites and services. We may also collect certain standard information that your browser sends to every web site you visit, such as your IP address, browser type and language, access times and referring Web site addresses. 

### Use of Personal Information

We use personal information to provide you with the services you have requested from us and our partners. In addition, we use personal information to send you periodic email communications about products and services offered by us or our partners, to operate and improve our Sites and services, to respond to customer inquiries, and to send you survey or other communications. 

### Disclosure of Personal Information

We do not rent, sell or share personal information about you with other people except to provide products or services you’ve specifically requested from us or our partners, and under the following circumstances: 

  * **Third Party Service Providers.** We may disclose personal information to one or more third parties to provide you with the services you’ve specifically requested. For example, if you request our help in locating a senior care provider, we may disclose your personal information to one or more senior care providers who will contact you directly. If you request information from our third party providers, including those providing help with relocation or other elder care services, we may disclose your personal information to one or more of such providers who will contact you directly. Service providers may contact you by email, telephone, regular mail, in person visits or other means. We do not regulate how these third party service providers use or disclose your personal information. 
  * **Internal Analysis and Operations.** We may disclose information about you for our own internal statistical, design or operational purposes, such as to estimate our audience size, measure aggregate traffic patterns, and understand demographic trends among our users. We may outsource these tasks and disclose personal information about you to third parties, provided the use and disclosure of your personal information by these third parties is restricted to performance of such tasks. 
  * **Legal and Other Compliance.** We may disclose personal information when we believe it is appropriate to comply with the law; to enforce or apply this privacy statement or our other policies or agreements; to protect our or our users' rights, property or safety; or to protect our users from fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful use of, our Sites; or if we reasonably believe that an emergency involving immediate danger of death or serious physical injury to any person requires disclosure of communications or justifies disclosure of records without delay. 
  * **Business Transfers.** We may disclose personal information as part of any merger, acquisition, debt financing, sale of company assets, or other business transaction.
