# Apex Learning About Us > Privacy Policy

Apex Learning Inc.'s ("Apex") policy is to respect and protect the privacy of our Users. This policy statement tells you how we collect information from you, what we disclose, and how we use that information. 

There is a separate section of this policy for parents or guardians of children under the age of 13 who want to register to participate in demonstrations or activities on our Web sites or who want to register and enroll in our courses.

By using any of the Apex Web sites or allowing your children to use these sites, including apexlearning.com or any online courses, workshops, or products you access through these sites, you signify your assent to the Apex Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to this policy, please do not use our sites. In addition, your continued use of the Apex sites following the posting of changes to these terms will mean you accept those changes.

Type of Personal Information Collected

When you register at any of the Apex Web sites either to view a demo or begin the enrollment process, Apex will request information that may include, but is not limited to, your name and email address. When you enroll in an Apex online course or workshop we may request additional information. We request different information if you are a student or a teacher or school administrator, but our requests can include your home contact information, school contact information, age, gender, parents' names, year of graduation, educational degrees, job title, years of teaching experience, grade level you teach, teaching certifications, and other Apex courses or workshops previously taken.

Please see the separate section below on steps we take before collecting information from children under the age of 13 who want to register to participate in activities on our Web sites or who want to enroll in a course.  


How Information Is Collected and Updated

We collect personal information directly from you by asking you to complete online registration and enrollment forms. We also collect non-personal information indirectly by using cookies and collecting IP addresses.

To inform Apex of changes to your personal information contact our Student Services department via phone 1-800-453-6227 or email.  
Mail to: [services@apexlearning.com](mailto:services@apexlearning.com).

Continue reading to understand our policy on disclosure and use of personal and non-personal information, and to learn more about indirect collection methods.

What Information Is Disclosed and What You Can Opt to Withhold

If you are registered to gain access to a segment of a Web site such as a demonstration, your name may be disclosed to others who are using that demonstration. For example, if the demonstration of a course or workshop includes a threaded discussion and you choose to post a message, your name will be disclosed to other visitors to this portion of the site.

If you register and then enroll in a course or workshop, your name, state of residence, and email address will be disclosed to your online instructor. That information will also be disclosed to other students in your course or workshop, however, you can opt to have certain information withheld from students: If you are an adult student (aged 18 or older), you may request that we not disclose your email address and state of residence to other students.  
Mail to: [services@apexlearning.com](mailto:services@apexlearning.com).

  * If you are a student aged 13 to 18, your parent or guardian can decide whether to withhold your email address or state of residence from other students and may contact us if that information should be withheld.   
Mail to: [services@apexlearning.com](mailto:services@apexlearning.com).
  * If you are a student under the age of 13, or the parent or guardian of that student, please see the section below about students under 13. 



All requests to withhold information should be made by calling 1-800-453-6227, or sending email to Student Services.  
Mail to: [services@apexlearning.com](mailto:services@apexlearning.com).

Apex cooperates with law enforcement and other third parties to enforce laws, intellectual property, and other rights, and we reserve the right to report any illegal activity to law enforcement for prosecution. We also reserve the right to release personal information about a User who we believe is in violation of our Terms of Use or Privacy Policy even without a subpoena warrant or other court order.

How Information Is Used

Except as described above, Apex assumes, unless you specifically tell us otherwise, that you do NOT want: 1) your personal information shared with third parties, 2) to receive communications from Apex about new offerings or services, or 3) to have your personal information used for Apex marketing purposes.

Apex may, however, use aggregate information for its own purposes or share aggregate information about our Users with advertisers, business partners, sponsors, and other third parties. For example, we may tell a business partner that x percent of Apex's students are from the West Coast and y percent from the South.

Special Notice to Parents/Guardians of Children Under 13

Apex encourages parents and guardians to spend time online with their children and to participate in the activities offered on sites. If your child wants to register and enroll with us, once you've notified Apex as described below, we recommend you and your child complete the online forms together.

No information may be submitted to or posted at Apex by Users under 13 years of age without the written consent of their parent or guardian. That means that before a User under 13 registers, he or she is required to have his or her parent/guardian contact Apex so that we can inform the parent/guardian about information we collect, any information we disclose, and what can be withheld from disclosure.

When you contact us, we'll ask you to read this privacy policy and provide you with a copy, and send to you in writing (by regular mail or email) a statement of what information we collect, what we must disclose for your student to participate, and what can be withheld from disclosure. Before your child can register or enroll, we'll need a confirmation in writing from you (either by email or regular mail) consenting to collection and to the required disclosure, and opting to disclose or withhold additional collected information. See the information in the paragraph **"What Information Is Disclosed or You Can Opt to Withhold."**

Apex won't require a child to disclose any more than the minimum needed to participate. No individually identifiable information collected from Users under 13 years of age is used for any marketing or promotional purposes whatsoever, either inside or outside Apex unless otherwise disclosed during collection or explicitly stated during registration.

Parents can review information collected, have information deleted, or refuse to allow further collection or disclosure. To review information or withdraw or modify your consent, please contact us by phone or by email.   
Mail to: [services@apexlearning.com](mailto:services@apexlearning.com).

Please note that your decision to have all information deleted or your decision to refuse disclosure of certain information required for a student's participation in a course may result in your student being withdrawn from course. Our standard withdrawal and refund policy will apply.

IP Addresses and HTTP Headers

An IP address is a number that's automatically assigned to your computer whenever you're surfing the Web. Web servers—the big computers that "serve up" Web pages—automatically identify your computer by its IP address.

Apex collects IP addresses for the sole purpose of identifying which service provider our Users are utilizing, whether AOL, MSN, etc. This allows us to better develop our products for end User use. When Users request pages from Apex sites, our servers log the Users' IP address. We do not normally link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable. We can and will use IP addresses to identify a User when we feel it is necessary to enforce compliance with our house rules or terms of service or to protect our service, site, customers, or others.

Cookies

Apex uses cookies. Cookies are pieces of information that a Web site transfers to an individual's hard drive for record-keeping purposes. Cookies collect non-personal information including the URL you came from, browser you use, what URL you go to next, etc. We do not save passwords or credit card information in cookies. Apex has three primary uses for cookies. First, we use them for session variables, to facilitate Users' movement through the learning environment and Apex courses. Second, we use them to check a User's browser type so that we can ensure that our courses run optimally on the User's computer. Finally, we use cookies to authenticate a User's access to content. For example, if a User is a student in a Calculus course, we use cookies to ensure that the User sees only Calculus course content.

Links to Other Web sites

Users should be aware that when they are on the Apex site, they could be directed to other sites that are beyond our control. For example, if you "click" a link to a partner or affiliate of ours or to a site we have listed in one of our courses, the "click" takes you off the Apex site. Apex explicitly disclaims any responsibility for the accuracy, content, or availability of information found on sites that link to or from Apex. Apex cannot be held responsible for the accuracy, copyright compliance, legality, or decency of material contained in third-party sites, and you hereby irrevocably waive any claim against us with respect to such sites.

Third-party sites may send their own cookies to Users, collect data, or solicit personal information. Apex does not make any representations or warranties as to the security of any information (including, without limitation, credit card and other personal information) you might be requested to give any third party, and you hereby irrevocably waive any claim against us with respect to such sites. We strongly encourage you to make whatever investigation you feel necessary or appropriate before proceeding with any online or offline transaction with any of these third parties.

Chats, Forums, Message Boards, and Email

Apex Learning provides educational products and builds educational communities. Our online instructors, and instructor services and student services staff, monitor and respond to users' email and monitor and participate with users in threaded discussions and other online forum. Apex may also monitor, edit, or disclose the contents of a User's email or of threaded discussions or other online forum as required for normal maintenance of any of our Web sites or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to: (1) comply with the law or comply with legal process served on Apex; (2) protect and defend the rights or property of Apex; or (3) act in an emergency to protect the personal safety of our guests or the public.

Please keep in mind that whenever you give out personal information online—for example, via message boards, forums, or chats—that information can be collected and used by people you don't know even if they're also students that are enrolled online. While Apex strives to protect our Users' personal information and privacy, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you disclose online, and you do so at your own risk. Users shall remain solely responsible for the content of their messages.

Ownership of Submissions

Except to the extent Apex must obtain your permission under this privacy policy or under the Family Educational Records Privacy Act, by uploading or posting materials to chats, message boards or other forms of public communication or by submitting any assignments, emails or materials to Apex, you automatically grant (or warrant that the owner of such rights has expressly granted) us, so long as Apex does not personally identify you as the author, a perpetual, royalty free, irrevocable, nonexclusive right and license to use, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, translate, create derivative works from, and distribute such materials or incorporate such materials into any form, medium, or technology now known or later developed throughout the universe. In addition, you warrant that all so-called moral rights in those materials have been waived.

Security

The importance of security for all personally identifiable information associated with our Users is of utmost concern to us. We exercise great care in providing secure transmission of your information from your computer to our servers. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, Apex can't ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or from our online products or services, and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission, we make our best effort to ensure its security on our systems. When credit card information is transmitted we use industry standard, 128-bit SSL (secure socket layer) encryption. Your Apex access to an Apex course or workshop is password-protected so that only you can access it and view the information relevant to the account. We strongly recommend that you do not divulge your password to anyone. Apex will never ask you for your password in an unsolicited phone call or email. Ultimately, you are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your passwords and any account information.

Remember to sign off from Apex and close your browser window when you have finished your work. This is to ensure that others cannot access your personal information and correspondence if your computer is accessible to others or if you share a computer with someone else or are using a computer in a public place, such as a school or library.
