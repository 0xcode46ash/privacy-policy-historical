# Apex Learning About Us > Privacy Policy

Â  | 

Apex Learning Inc.'s ("Apex") policy is to respect and protect the privacy of the people who use our site ("Users"). This policy statement tells you what information we collect from you, how we use that information, and with whom we may share it. Please take a few moments to read this policy before using our site.

By using any of the Apex Web sites, including apexlearning.com or any online courses, workshops, or products you access through these sites, you are consenting to the Apex Privacy Policy and any changes made in it from time to time by Apex. If Apex decides to change this Privacy Policy, Apex will post a new policy on the site and change the date at the top of the new policy. Apex encourages you to check the date of the Privacy Policy whenever you visit the sites for any updates or changes.

How Personal Information Is Collected and Updated

We collect personal information (information that individually identifies you) directly from you when you complete online registration and enrollment forms, and when you participate in our online courses. In some cases, the institution funding your participation in the course ("Sponsoring Institution") may provide information about you to us.

To inform Apex of changes to your personal information contact our Support Team via phone, 1-800-453-6227, or email, [support@apexlearning.com](mailto:support@apexlearning.com).

If you do not want to receive these communications you can opt out by sending an email to support@apexlearning.com. If you are a teacher or an administrator, Apex may send you communications about Apex or information from other members of our strategic alliance. If you do not want to receive these communications you can opt out with an email to [support@apexlearning.com](mailto:support@apexlearning.com). When you participate in an Apex course, we may share information you provide to us with your Sponsoring Institution. Information that may be shared includes, but is not limited to, assignments, grades, discussions, and end-of-the-year performance.
  *  **Registration** : If you register and then enroll in a course or workshop, your name, email address, school, phone number and state of residence will be shared with your online instructor.

  *  **Discussion Boards, Forums and Email** : Apex Learning provides educational products and builds educational communities. Our online instructors, instructor services, and student services staff monitor and respond to Users' email and monitor and participate with Users in threaded discussions and other online forums. Apex may monitor or edit the contents of a User's email or of threaded discussions or other online forums as required for normal maintenance of any of our Web sites or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to: (1) comply with the law or comply with legal process served on Apex; (2) protect and defend the rights or property of Apex; or (3) act to protect the personal safety of our guests or the public.

Apex cooperates with law enforcement and other third parties to enforce laws, intellectual property, and other rights, and we reserve the right to report any information related to suspicion of illegal activity to law enforcement for prosecution. We also reserve the right to release personal information about a User who we believe is in violation of our Code of Conduct, Terms of Use, or Privacy Policy even without a subpoena, warrant or other court order.

  *  **Business Transfers** : Information about our Users, including personal information, may be disclosed as part of any merger, acquisition, debt financing, sale of company assets, as well as in the unlikely event of an insolvency, bankruptcy or receivership in which personal information could be transferred to third parties as one of the business assets of the company.



Except as described in this policy, Apex will not disclose your personal information to third parties.

Apex may, however, use aggregate information that does not identify you personally for its own purposes, or share aggregate information about our Users with advertisers, business partners, sponsors, and other third parties. For example, we may tell a business partner that x percent of Apex's students are from the West Coast and y percent from the South.

Children

Our site is a general audience site that is not designed nor intended to collect personal information from children under the age of 13.

IP Addresses and HTTP Headers

An IP address is a number that's automatically assigned to your computer whenever you're surfing the Web. Web servers-the big computers that "serve up" Web pages-automatically identify your computer by its IP address. When you request pages from Apex sites, our servers log your IP address. Apex collects these IP addresses for the sole purpose of identifying our Users' service providers -- whether AOL, MSN, etc. -- so we can better develop our products. We do not normally link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable. We can and will use IP addresses to identify a User when we feel it is necessary to enforce compliance with our Code of Conduct and Terms of Use or to protect our service, site, customers, or others.

Cookies

Apex uses cookies. Cookies are small text files that are stored on a user's computer by a Web server. A cookie itself is not designed or intended to read any information from a user's computer (other than the contents of the cookie); rather, it is an identifier used by the Web site that originally placed it on your hard drive. The actual contents of the cookie information can be retrieved by the same server to identify the computer and subsequently to customize, monitor, or regulate the use of a site based on information stored on the host server. Therefore, cookies only identify the user's computer to the Web site, which then may correlate other information, including personal information, with the cookie.

Apex has three primary uses for cookies. First, we use them for session variables, to facilitate your movement through the learning environment and Apex courses. Second, we use them to determine if cookies are enabled in your browser so that we may ensure that our courses run optimally on your computer. Finally, we use cookies to authenticate your access to content. For example, if you are a student in a Calculus course, we use cookies to ensure that you see only Calculus course content. We do not store passwords or credit card information in cookies.

Links to Other Web sites

You should be aware that when you are on the Apex site, you could be directed to other sites that are beyond our control. For example, if you "click" a link to a partner or affiliate of ours or to a site we have listed in one of our courses, the "click" takes you off the Apex site. Apex is not responsible for the content or information collection practices of these Web sites. Please note that these Web sites' privacy policies may differ from Apex's privacy policy. We encourage you to review and understand their privacy practices before providing them with information.

Discussion Boards, Forums, and Email

Please keep in mind that whenever you give out personal information online-for example, via message boards, forums, or chats-that information can be collected and used by people you don't know, even if they're also students who are enrolled online. While Apex strives to protect your personal information and privacy, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you disclose online, and you do so at your own risk. You shall remain solely responsible for the content of your messages.

Security

No data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, Apex can't ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or from our online products or services, and you do so at your own risk. When credit card information is transmitted we use industry-standard security measures.

Your access to an Apex course or workshop is password-protected so that only you can access it and view the information relevant to the account. We strongly recommend that you do not divulge your password to anyone. Apex will never ask you for your password in an unsolicited phone call or email. Ultimately, you are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your passwords and any account information. Remember to sign off from Apex and close your browser window when you have finished your work.
