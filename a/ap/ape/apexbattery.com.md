We are committed to protect all customer information collected on our site. We DO NOT sell, share or rent this information to others. Your contact information is used for billing purposes and to process your order. We use it, also, to contact you if we have any questions on your order.

Our secure server software (SSL) is the industry standard and among the finest software available today for ensuring secure commerce transactions. This secure software ENCRYPTS ALL of your personal information, including credit card number, name, and address, so that it cannot be read as the information is sent to us. The encryption process takes the characters you enter and converts them into bits of "scrambled" code before they are securely transmitted via the Internet. Furthermore, you can be assured that the information you give us is private. We do not sell, share or rent this information to others.
