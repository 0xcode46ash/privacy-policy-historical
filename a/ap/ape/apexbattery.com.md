# Privacy Policy - Information

[](https://www.scanalert.com/RatingVerify?ref=www.apexbattery.com) [](http://smallbusiness.yahoo.com/merchant/)

Your privacy is protected. Apex Battery does NOT sell or rent your name, address or e-mail to anyone.

We are committed to protect all customer information collected on our site. We DO NOT sell, share or rent this information to others. Your contact information is used for billing purposes and to process your order. We use it, also, to contact you if we have any questions on your order.

Apex Battery uses SSL (Secure Socket Layer) encryption when transmitting certain kinds of information, such as financial services information or payment information. An icon resembling a padlock is displayed on the bottom of most browsers window during SSL transactions that involve credit cards and other forms of payment. Any time Apex Battery asks you for a credit card number on Apex Battery for payment or for verification purposes, it will be SSL encrypted. The information you provide will be stored securely on our servers. Once you choose to store or enter your credit card number on Apex Battery, it will not be displayed back to you in its entirety when you retrieve or edit it in the future. Instead of the entire number, you will only see asterisks and either the first four digits or the last four digits of your number. 

Our secure server software (SSL) is the industry standard and among the finest software available today for ensuring secure commerce transactions. This secure software ENCRYPTS ALL of your personal information, including credit card number, name, and address, so that it cannot be read as the information is sent to us. The encryption process takes the characters you enter and converts them into bits of "scrambled" code before they are securely transmitted via the Internet. Furthermore, you can be assured that the information you give us is private. We do not sell, share or rent this information to others. 

HACKER SAFE certification is achieved by passing rigorous daily network security audits. The certification process is completed in six steps. The first three steps are the vulnerability audit itself; comprised of Dynamic Port Scanning, Port-level Network Services Vulnerability Testing, and Web Application Vulnerability Testing. The fourth and fifth steps receiving alerts whenever vulnerabilities are detected and quick remediation management using our extensive vulnerability management portal and comprehensive technical support. 

The result is highly effective, pro-active security.
