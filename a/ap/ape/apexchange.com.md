With regard to non-personally identifiable information, AP is currently using and has contracted with third party vendors to track and analyze usage and volume statistical information from our users to administer our content in order to improve our services. We may also perform statistical analysis of user behavior in order to measure interest in our online products and services for product development purposes and to inform advertisers as to how many consumers have seen or clicked their advertisement. We also use demographic and preference information to allow advertisements on our sites to be targeted to the users for whom they are most pertinent, so users see advertising that is most likely to interest them, and advertisers send their messages to people who are most likely to be receptive. 

This information may also be used as part of our demographic research. In this event, the research is compiled and analyzed on an aggregated basis. The Associated Press reserves the right and may grant to third parties such right to publish non-personally identifiable, aggregate information regarding our users for promotional purposes and as a representative audience for advertisers. 

AP will not disclose any personally identifiable information about our current or former users to anyone, except as permitted or required by law, or as described herein. AP will endeavor to maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect the confidentiality of the information that we collect online.
