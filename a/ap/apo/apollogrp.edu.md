## Definitions

### Cookies

Data created by a Web server that is stored on a user's computer. It provides a way for the Web site to keep track of a user's patterns and preferences and, with the cooperation of the Web browser, to store them on the user's own hard disk.

The cookies contain a range of [URL](https://web.archive.org/web/20050307224028id_/http://www.apollogrp.edu/Privacy/Default.aspx#url)s (Web addresses) for which they are valid. When the browser encounters those URLs again, it sends those specific cookies to the Web server. For example, if a user's ID were stored as a cookie, it would save that person from typing in the same information all over again when accessing that service for the second and subsequent time during the same browser session. 

You can opt out of the use of cookies by having your browser disable cookies or warn you before accepting a cookie. Look for the cookie options in your browser in the Options or Preferences menu.

**NOTE:   If you disable cookies in your browser, you will not be able to access any of Apollo Group's secured Web sites.**
