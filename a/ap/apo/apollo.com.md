# Privacy Policy

**Privacy Policy**

This Privacy Policy sets forth guidelines concerning how Apollo Global Management, LLC (together with its subsidiaries and affiliates “Apollo”, “us”, “we” or “our”) gathers and uses information about your interaction with this website (the “Site”). This Privacy Policy concerns only this Site, and does not concern any website to which this Site may link. 

This Privacy Policy seeks to help you understand whether and how we collect information about you when you visit the Site, and how we use such information. Please read this Privacy Policy carefully, and consult our Terms of Use for more information about the general terms and conditions regarding your use of this Site. 

In the event that you have any questions or concerns about the guidelines set forth in this Privacy Policy please contact us at InvestorRelations@agm.com or Webmaster, Apollo Global Management, LLC, 9 West 57th Street, New York, NY 10019. 

A. The Types of Information We Collect About You 

When you visit and browse the Site, we may collect two different types of information about you: information you provide to us, and information we collect through technology. 

1\. Information You Provide to Us 

In order to obtain access to certain services provided via the Site and request certain information regarding Apollo directly from the company via the Site, you may be required to provide personally identifiable information such as your name, postal address, e-mail address, telephone number, facsimile number and investor status. You can choose not to provide this information, but then you might not be able to gain access to such information and services. 

2\. Information We Collect Through Technology 

We may collect information about you through technology. For example, when you visit the Site, we may collect your IP address. (An IP address is often associated with the portal through which you enter the Internet, like your ISP (Internet service provider), your company, or your university.) Standing alone, your IP address is not personally identifiable. At times, we may also use IP addresses to collect information regarding the frequency with which visitors browse various parts of the Site. We may combine this information with personally identifiable information. 

The Site may also use cookies. (Cookies are pieces of information that a website sends to your computer while you are viewing the website.) We and other companies use cookies for a variety of purposes. For instance, when you return to our Site after logging in, cookies provide information to the Site so that the Site will remember who you are. You can choose to have your computer warn you each time a cookie is being sent, or you can choose to turn off all cookies. You do this through your web browser settings. Each browser is a little different, so look at your browser Help menu to learn the correct way to modify your cookies. If you turn cookies off, you won't have access to many features that may make your browsing of the Site smoother, like the features mentioned above, and some of our services may not function properly. 

The Site may also use other technical methods to track visitor usage, including web beacons. (“Web beacons” are small pieces of data that are embedded in images on the pages of a website.) We may also use these technical methods to analyze the traffic patterns on the Site, such as the frequency with which our users visit various parts of the Site. These technical methods may involve the transmission of information either directly to us or to another party authorized by us to collect information on our behalf. We may also use these technical methods in HTML e-mails that we send visitors to the Site to determine whether such visitors have opened those e-mails and/or clicked on links in those e-mails. We may collect the information from use of these technical methods in a form that is personally identifiable. To the extent we are able to do so, we may link your non-personally identifiable information with your personally identifiable information.  We may also link information collected online with information we collect offline or that is collected online by third parties. ****

Also, our third-party service providers may ask you voluntarily to provide personal information on their websites and may share such personal information with us, as governed by their respective privacy policies.  Our use of information received from a service provider will be dictated by the service provider's privacy policies and not this Privacy Policy. 

We may provide links on the Site to third parties. In addition, third parties may also provide links to the Site. Should you choose to visit these third party sites, you should review their privacy policies to ensure you understand and are comfortable with their practices concerning your personal information. We do not accept, and do disclaim, any responsibility for the privacy policies and information protection practices of any third party website (whether or not such site is linked on or to the Site). These links are provided to you for convenience purposes only, and you access them at your own risk. 

B. How Personally Identifiable Information We Collect About You is Used 

We may use personally identifiable information we collect about you when you visit and browse the Site in many ways. Representative examples of the ways in which we may use personally identifiable information we collect about you when you visit and browse the Site are set forth below. 

1\. Use in Connection with Normal Business Operations 

Although, we do not sell your personal information to third parties, we may use or share certain personally identifiable information we collect about you when you visit and browse the Site as part of our normal business operations (such as processing your requests for forms or other literature or information, transactions, service, or to prepare investor disclosure materials), or to send you administrative communications either about your interactions with us or about features of our website, including any future changes to this Privacy Policy. 

2\. Use in Connection with Third Party Offers 

We may also share your information with third parties when you engage in certain activities on the Site that are sponsored by third parties, such as purchasing products or services offered by a third party, or electing to receive information or communications from a third party. When you participate in such, you will either be required or requested to agree that the sponsor or business associate may use your personal information (including, in some cases, your e-mail address) in accordance with the sponsor or business associate’s privacy practices. 

3\. Other Uses 

Sometimes we hire companies to help deliver products or services, like a shipping company that delivers a package. In that instance, there is a need to share your information with that company. Sometimes we also work with other companies who help either gather your information or communicate with you. Except as separately permitted by the guidelines of this Privacy Policy, these companies are allowed to gather, receive, and use your information only for the purposes described in this paragraph or as required by law. 

Finally, we may take any personally identifiable information that we collect from you when you visit and browse the Site and make it non-personally identifiable, either by combining it with information about other individuals (aggregating your information with information about other individuals), or by removing characteristics (such as your name) that make the information personally identifiable to you (de-personalizing your information). Given the nature of this information, there are no restrictions under the guidelines set forth in this Privacy Policy upon our right to aggregate or de-personalize your personal information, and we reserve the right to use and/or share with third parties the resulting non-personally identifiable information in any way. 

C. Additional Ways Personally Identifiable Information May be Disclosed 

We may share your personal information with our affiliates.  From time to time, we may partner with other organizations or companies to provide co-sponsored or co-branded promotions, services or events and may share your personal information with our co-sponsor(s) and partners.  We will also disclose personal information when we believe in good faith that such disclosures (a) are required by law, including, for example, to comply with a court order or subpoena, or in response to a law enforcement agency's request, or (b) will help to: enforce our Terms of Use; protect your safety or security, including the safety and security of property that belongs to you; and/or, protect the safety and security of the Sites, databases, and/or third parties, including the safety and security of tangible and/or intangible property that belongs to us or to third parties. We may also transfer your information to any other entity that acquires all or a portion of our organization by merger, reorganization, operation of law, or a sale of some or all of our assets. 

D. The Security Measures We Take to Safeguard Your Personally Identifiable Information 

The security and confidentiality of your information is extremely important to us. We have implemented commercially reasonable technical, administrative, and physical security measures to protect personal information from reasonably foreseeable intrusions by unauthorized third parties. From time to time, we review our security procedures in order to consider appropriate new technology and methods. Please be aware though that, despite our best efforts, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable. 

E. Updating Your Contact Information 

We will provide you an opportunity to update your contact information and/or modify your communication choices by sending you an e-mail or other communication that invites your response, or by providing a means to update that information via the Site. 

F.  Children’s Information

The Site is intended for use by those over 18 and minors under the age of 13 may not use the Site.  We do not knowingly solicit or collect personal information on the Site from children under the age of 13 without prior verifiable parental consent. If we learn that, despite these measures, a child under the age of 13 has submitted personally identifiable information to us through the Site, we will take reasonable measures to delete such information from our records and to not use such information for any purpose (except where necessary to protect the safety of the child or others as required by law).

G.  Do Not Track

Your browser and other mechanisms may permit you to send do-not-track signals or other similar signals to express your preferences regarding online tracking.  As we do not track users across time or over multiple websites, we do not receive, or respond to, browser do-not-track signals or other similar mechanisms.  As noted above, third parties, such as our advertising partners, may collect data that relates to you.  We cannot control third parties’ responses to do-not-track signals or other such mechanisms.  Third parties’ use of data relating to you and responsiveness to do-not-track signals is governed by their respective privacy policies.

H.  California Privacy Rights

If you are a California resident, you have the right to request information from us regarding the manner in which Company shares certain categories of personal information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes, in addition to the rights set forth above.  Under California law, you have the right to send us a request at the designated address listed below to receive the following information:

1\. The categories of information we disclosed to third parties for their direct marketing purposes during the preceding calendar year;

2\. the names and addresses of the third parties that received the information; and

3\. if the nature of the third party's business cannot be determined from their name, examples of the products or services marketed.

This information may be provided in a standardized format that is not specific to you.  The designated email address for these requests is: [privacy@apollolp.com](mailto:privacy@apollolp.com).

  
I.  European Subject Access Requests

If you believe that personal data relating to you is held by an entity within Apollo's group which is subject to European data protection legislation, you have the right to know what information that entity holds about you. In these circumstances, Apollo will, within a reasonable timeframe, provide you with a complete list of all the personal data which is held about you by the relevant entity. Apollo reserves the right to charge an administration fee of £10 (or an equivalent in any other currency) for this service.

I.  Amendments to this Privacy Policy 

These guidelines were adopted with the realization that both the Internet and the Site are still evolving. Accordingly, this Privacy Policy is subject to change. Should this Privacy Policy be amended in any way, changes will be posted to this webpage.  As we may make changes from time to time without notifying you, we suggest that you periodically consult this Privacy Policy.  Your continued use of the Site after the effective date of any modification to the Privacy Policy will be deemed to be your agreement to the changed terms.
