# Privacy Policy - Apollo Motorhome Holidays

_Last updated November 2014_

Apollo Motorhome Holidays Pty Ltd ACN 051 584 153 in Australia and its related entities including Apollo Motorhome Holidays Ltd in New Zealand and Apollo Motorhome Holidays LLC in the United States (referred to in this policy as **we, us, our** ) recognise the importance of protecting the privacy of personal information we collect about you. 

The Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) ( **Privacy Act** ), Australian Privacy Principles and registered privacy codes in Australia in addition to the Privacy Act of 1993 in New Zealand and the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) of 1967 in the USA govern the way in which we must manage your personal information. This Privacy Policy sets out how we collect, use, disclose and otherwise manage your personal information. 

This Privacy Policy should be reviewed periodically so that you are updated on any changes. 

## Your Personal Information

Personal Information is any information or opinion about an identified individual or an individual who is reasonably identifiable, whether the information or opinion is true or not, and whether the information or opinion is stored in a material form or not. 

We only collect personal information that is directly related to, or reasonably necessary for, our functions and activities. The types of personal information we usually collect include your name, address, phone number, email address and certain internet-related details (see below) and other information relevant to providing you with the information or services you are, or someone else you know is, seeking. 

Wherever practicable, we will enable you to deal with us anonymously or pseudonymously, however, in many cases it is not practicable to interact in this way. 

If you choose not to provide some of your personal details, this may prevent us from providing our services to you or limit our ability to provide the level of service you would normally expect from us. 

## How we collect Personal Information

Personal information will generally be collected directly from you when you rent a vehicle from us and through the use of any of our standard forms, our dealings with you over the internet, via email, or through a telephone conversation. The service that you use will determine exactly what information we collect. The information may include your: 

  * name;
  * address;
  * contact telephone number(s);
  * contact facsimile number(s);
  * date of birth;
  * country of Residence;
  * driver's licence number and state/country of origin;
  * frequent traveller program number;
  * vehicle preference;
  * credit card number(s) and expiry date(s);
  * email address;
  * company name and employee number;
  * contact details of individuals who can provide professional references and other information required in the Cash Qualification process;
  * reservations and rental details including dates, times and places of vehicle hire; and
  * preferences such as baby seat requirements, GPS requests, table and chair orders, etc.
  * vehicle damage circumstances and details.



There may, however, be some instances where personal information about you will be collected indirectly because it is unreasonable or impracticable to collect personal information directly from you. For example we may collect personal information through a travel agent, a corporate program or through one of our partner programs. We will usually notify you about these instances in advance, or where that is not possible, as soon as reasonably practicable after the information has been collected. 

If you access our website, we may collect additional personal information about you in the form of your IP address and domain name. Our website uses cookies. The main purpose of cookies is to identify users and to prepare customised web pages for them. Cookies do not identify you personally, but they may link back to a database record about you. We use cookies to monitor usage of our website and to create a personal record of when you visit our website and what pages you view so that we may serve you more effectively. You can disable cookies using your browser internet settings. 

If the personal information you provide us is incomplete or inaccurate, we may be unable to provide you, or someone else you know, with the services or information you or they are seeking.

## How we use the information we collect

We use your personal information for the purposes of collection as set out above. 

We may sometimes use the personal information we collect for a secondary purpose, that is, for use in a way different from the original reasons for collection set out above. We will only do this in the following circumstances:

## Security

We store your personal information in different ways, including in paper and in electronic form. The security of your personal information is important to us. We take all reasonable measures to ensure that your personal information is stored safely to protect it from misuse, loss, interference, unauthorised access, modification or disclosure, including electronic and physical security measures. We use industry standard safeguards to ensure the security of personal information through physical, electronic and managerial procedures. In addition, our employees and the contractors who provide services related to our information systems are obliged to respect the confidentiality of any personal information held by us.

If, upon receiving access to your personal information or at any other time, you believe the personal information we hold about you is inaccurate, incomplete or out of date, please notify us immediately. We will take reasonable steps to correct the information so that it is accurate, complete and up to date.
