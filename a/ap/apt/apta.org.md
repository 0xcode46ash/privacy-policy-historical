## Data Collection

APTA does not collect via the website names, email addresses, or any other personal information unless it is voluntarily provided by site visitors. Visitors will be informed when the website requires personal information (name, address, email address, telephone number, credit card number and/or other identifying information). APTA will not distribute this information to third-parties without your prior consent. 

Data submitted by a user will be used for the express purpose described at the point of collection in APTA's database and for statistical purposes to analyze user behavior. APTA will protect the information provided. APTA does not disclose, give, sell, or transfer personal information with third parties without the site visitor's express permission. If demographic information is given to third parties, only aggregate information will be provided. 

APTA may disclose your personal information if required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with any legal requirements or with a legal process, or to protect and defend the rights or property of APTA or the personal safety of APTA employees or members of the public. 

## Email

APTA will make every attempt to protect any personal information submitted to us electronically. However, electronic email is not secure against interception. Any sensitive information submitted to the website is provided at the risk of the sender. If you are concerned that the content of your communication is especially sensitive, you may consider sending it by postal mail instead. 

## Cookies

Cookies are small files used to send information from our website to your web browser. The website uses session cookies, which are destroyed when a user closes the Internet browser, and permanent cookies, which remain on the user's hard drive until manually deleted by clearing the cache. Cookies are used for many purposes, including allowing users to access member-protected content without logging in before loading each page. Permanent cookies allow users to utilize the "remember me" feature to avoid having to log in to the website after closing the previous Internet browser session. Cookies are also used in user analytics and the user's personal identity is not tracked. 

## External Links

The website contains links to other external websites. APTA is not responsible for the privacy policies, sites that may contain cookies, or the content of these external links. Please direct any questions or comments that you have to these external websites. 

## Public Access

Please note that the website contains discussion forums, message boards and other public or member based forums. Please note that any information that you provide in these forums may become public and/or available to all members and you must exercise caution when deciding to provide any information, including personal information. Although we try to protect personally identifiable information, APTA cannot guarantee the privacy of any information that you provide on these forums; accordingly, any information you provide is at your own risk. APTA is not responsible for maintaining the privacy or secrecy of any passwords or account information that you may have disclosed. 

## Security

Your privacy is of the utmost importance to us, but due to legal and security matters that are beyond our control, we cannot guarantee that the information that you may provide to us, including personally identifiable information, is not disclosed to a third party. APTA incorporates reasonable safeguards to protect the security, integrity, completeness, accuracy, and privacy of the personal information that we collect. To assist in making the website secure, we use the latest industry standards to safeguard the confidentiality of your personally identifiable information, such as firewalls and Secure Socket Layers (SSL), where appropriate. APTA has also put in place precautions to protect information from loss, misuse, and alteration. Only those APTA employees who need access to your information in order to do their job are allowed access. We have also put procedures in place to safeguard any credit card data we collect from you when making an order. Please note, however, that we cannot absolutely guarantee the security of any information you provide online; you provide it at your own risk.
