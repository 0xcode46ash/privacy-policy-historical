APS sets high standards and has a strong commitment to protect customers' privacy. When a user enters the APS Web site, our web server automatically recognizes the consumer's domain name, but not the e-mail address. This enables us to collect aggregate information on what pages consumers visit, information volunteered by the consumer, such as survey information and/or site registrations, and the e-mail address of those who communicate with us via e-mail. 

The information we collect is used to ensure quality customer service, to improve the content of our Web site, to notify consumers about updates to our Web site and to contact consumers for marketing purposes, and for other internal business purposes. 

The APS Web site does use cookies. "Cookies" are small pieces of information that are stored by your browser on your computer's hard drive. Our cookies do not contain any personally identifying information, but they do enable us to facilitate access to different aspects of your account across our website. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually change your browser to prevent that.

If you do not want to receive e-mail from us in the future, please let us know by e-mailing us at [aps@aps.com](mailto:aps@aps.com). We will remove your name from our list. 

If you supply us with your postal address on-line you will only receive the information for which you provided us your address. Persons who supply us with their telephone numbers on-line will only receive telephone contact from us with information regarding orders they have placed on-line. 

From time to time, we may use customer information for new, unanticipated uses not previously disclosed in our privacy notice. If our information practices change at some time in the future we will post the policy changes to our Web site to notify you of these changes and provide you with the ability to opt out of these new uses. If you are concerned about how your information is used, you should check back at our Web site periodically. 

Upon request, we offer visitors the ability to have inaccuracies corrected in contact information. Consumers can have this information corrected by calling us at the above telephone number or writing to us at the above address. 

With respect to security, we use industry-standard encryption technologies when transferring and receiving consumer data exchanged with our site. We have appropriate security measures in place in our physical facilities to protect against the loss, misuse or alteration of information that we have collected from you at our site. 

If you feel that this site is not following its stated information policy, you may contact us at the above address or phone number.
