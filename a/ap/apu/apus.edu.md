# APUS Privacy Policy

**Updated: July 2013**

####  **  
** **Online Privacy**

Online privacy is important to us. As such, it is the policy of American Public University System, its members, American Public University (“APU”) and American Military University (“AMU”), and American Public Education, Inc. (collectively, “APUS,” “we,” “our” or “us”), to collect and retain personal information only as appropriate in the course of providing information and services to our website visitors. This privacy policy describes our online collection and use of personal information about you at our websites. You are visiting one of our websites if they link to this Privacy Policy. 

Consistent with this policy, we collect information in the following ways:

  *  **Voluntarily Provided Information**



We may collect the following user provided personal information to include: full name, email address, postal address, social security number, date of birth, sex, phone number, and course assignments. In some cases, students who are enrolling in a course or program or buying books, or other visitors utilizing online commerce functions to purchase goods or services, may be required to provide credit card information for billing purposes. If making a request for Admissions or Transfer Credit, students may also be required to provide information related to prior academic history, employment, or military service. If a student chooses not to provide this personal information, he/she may be unable to receive some of the services we offer.

We also collect personal information when you voluntarily provide it or make it available to us by (1) logging into, or creating an account on one of our websites; (2) providing feedback to us through a feedback tool; (3) posting a review or making other comments on any public forums (“interactive features”) available on our websites; or (4) logging-in to our websites through a social media or similar tool, if available. Each manner in which we collect personal information about you identified above occurs only when you voluntarily provide information to us.

Note regarding interactive features: Regarding any public forums we may offer on our websites such as newsfeeds, blogs, message boards, social media features or similar tools (“interactive features”), the posts or comments you make may be public and viewed by others so you should use care before posting information about yourself, including personal information, online. You acknowledge and understand that you have no expectation of privacy or confidentiality in the content you submit to interactive features over our websites.  We assume no obligation to remove personal information from postings through interactive features on our websites and you disclose any personal information in your postings at your own risk.
