# Applebee's - See You Tomorrow

### Applebee's Services, Inc.

Effective Date: April 6, 2007

Applebee's International, Inc. (Applebee's) is committed to safeguarding your privacy; we take your privacy seriously. We will not sell, rent or otherwise distribute your personally identifiable information, which we receive through our website or from any other source, to third parties except as explained below. Please read the following policy to understand the care with which Applebee's will treat your information. This policy may change from time to time so please check back periodically.

If you have concerns, comments or questions concerning this policy, please contact:

[privacydesk@applebees.com](mailto:privacydesk@applebees.com)

Please note that this Privacy Policy does not apply to (a) employment applications submitted through the Web site, which may be shared with independently-owned franchises which are seeking employees in their market area and (b) information from international franchising prospects which is covered by a separate privacy policy, accessible from the International Franchising portion of the Web site.

#### What information does Applebee's collect from me?

Applebee's may collect information about you, such as your name, postal address, email address, zip code, phone number and dining preferences through any of the following: online email address submissions, in-restaurant surveys, research surveys, dining frequency cards, online gift card purchases, guest relations communications and online restaurant location searches or other voluntary activities. Additionally, use of the Applebee’s mobile application may also result in the collection of additional information such as your user name and password, your birthday, and information related to an Applebee’s GPS location.

#### Can I remain anonymous when I provide information to Applebee's?

You can visit our Web site without identifying yourself or giving us any personal information. If you give us your email address, purchase gift cards online, voluntarily provide feedback to Guest Relations or complete a survey, you will no longer be anonymous to Applebee's. We may ask you for additional information from time to time, which you may decide to provide to us or not. If you contact Applebee's through the Web site or otherwise, we may keep a record of that correspondence.

#### How does Applebee's use the information?

Applebee's primary goal in collecting information is to improve customer service by understanding your preferences, communicating Applebee's promotions and services and providing you with the best possible experience. For example, if you visit our Web site and give us your zip code, we are able to provide the location of the Applebee's restaurant closest to you. We may also use your information to notify you of special offers and services available from Applebee's, its affiliated companies and franchisees.

On a blinded, aggregated basis, we may do research on our guests' and Web site users' demographics and behavior based on the information you, other guests and users provide to us. Personally identifiable information would not be used for this type of research. We may disclose such blinded and aggregated data and user statistics to third parties and for other lawful purposes.

#### Does Applebee's share my information?

We will not sell, rent or otherwise distribute your personally identifiable information to third parties, except when we have your permission or under the following circumstances:

  * **As required by law:** We may disclose or access your information when we believe in good faith that the law requires it.
  * **Gift cards:** We use a third party service provider to facilitate the gift card service. That third party is required to maintain the confidentiality of your gift card information and may only use your information for the purposes of fulfilling and tracking your order, customer service and reporting to us.
  * **To provide service:** We may share aggregated, non-identifiable information as well as personally identifiable information with our franchisees, affiliated companies and service providers, such as those who provide gift card service or email marketing. All such service providers are under contract with Applebee's to help provide specific services. If you do not want your information to be shared, you can choose not to provide the information.
  * **Other:** We may disclose user information in special cases when we have reason to believe that disclosing such information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be violating [Applebee's Web Site Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/legal/terms-of-use), or may otherwise be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) Applebee's rights or property, other Applebee's Web site users or customers, or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities. We may also need to disclose user information to service providers when necessary to maintain, service or improve our Web site, products and services. As we continue to develop our business, we may buy or sell business assets. In such transactions, confidential customer information generally is one of the transferred business assets. In the event of a sale of some or all of Applebee's business, customer and site visitor information may be one of the transferred assets.



#### How can I control access to my personal information and its use?

You may contact us at the email address above if you wish to view, edit or delete your personal information from our database and we will use commercially reasonable efforts to accommodate your request.

#### How does Applebee's protect financial-related information?

Keeping your personal financial information private is vitally important to us. You may provide such information to us when you purchase gift cards online. We do not store credit card numbers or bank account numbers. This information will be kept secure and we will transfer your credit card number, bank account number or other personal information only to the third party gift card service provider, which is bound to keep your information confidential, and to the appropriate credit card company or bank only in order to process any online payments.

#### What security precautions are in place to protect the loss, misuse or alteration of my information?

We closely guard your personally identifiable information. We use encryption technology for credit card numbers and bank account numbers. Remember to close your browser window when you have finished your gift card order. This is to ensure that others cannot access your information by using your computer when you are away from it. Because of the global nature of the Internet, when you give us information, that information may be sent electronically to servers outside of the country where you originally entered the information. Though no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, Applebee's employs security techniques that are designed to protect the privacy of any information you share with us.

#### What are cookies and how does Applebee's use them?

As part of offering personalized service, we sometimes use cookies and beacon tags or web bugs to store and understand more information about you, such as your nearest Applebee's restaurant. A cookie is a small amount of data that is sent to your browser from a Web server and stored on your computer's hard drive. Beacon tags and web bugs allow us to understand what users have viewed a page. We may use cookies, tags or bugs to allow faster and easier access to your information and to monitor traffic on the site and measure traffic patterns to improve functionality.

#### How do I opt out?

If you no longer wish to receive ongoing marketing communications from us, we will provide you with simple instructions on each marketing email from Applebee's to enable you to unsubscribe from future emails from Applebee's. You may also contact the Privacy Desk as explained above or opt out here.

#### What else should I know about my privacy?

Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily disclose information online, that information may be accessible to other online users. Ultimately, you are solely responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your passwords and/or any other personal information. Please be careful and responsible whenever you are online.

#### How is information from children treated?

Applebee's does not intend to collect any personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13 without verifiable parental consent. In fact, when we request personal information from users of this Web site, we also ask for their birthdate in order to comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) which prohibits the collecting of personal information of anyone under the age of 13. If we learn that such a child has provided us with personally identifiable information, we will immediately delete it. If you learn that such a child has provided us with personally identifiable information, the parent or guardian should contact us at the Privacy Desk above and we will immediately delete it.
