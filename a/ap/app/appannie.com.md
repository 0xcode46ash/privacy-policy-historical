# Privacy Policy | App Annie

App Annie (the “Service”) is a product/service of Exoweb (Cayman) Limited (“We”). We are committed to protecting and respecting your privacy. We understand that the use of the Service requires sensitive statistical and financial data to be stored on our servers, and that steps must be taken to ensure this data stays private. Understand that your privacy and the security of your data is our primary concern.

### WHAT INFORMATION WE COLLECT

Aside from the data collected via the iTunes Connect account of the user, we collect the e-mail addresses of those who communicate with us via e-mail, aggregate information on what pages users access or visit, and information volunteered by the user (such as survey information and/or site registrations). This information is used to improve the content of our website and the quality of our service, and is not shared with or sold to other organizations for commercial purposes. We don’t collect or store any information that is not required and necessary for providing our Service.

We use cookies to track your session information in order to improve your experience of the site and the quality of our service. Sensitive information is never stored in cookies.

### INFORMATION SECURITY

Your iTunes Connect account login and password are used solely for the purpose of obtaining sales reports from iTunes Connect. To further protect your iTunes Connect account, you can limit access by AppAnnie using a separated account with limited roles. See our FAQ on how to set this up.

All data that is transferred between your computer and our Service is encrypted with Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology.

### OWNERSHIP AND PRIVACY OF DATA

You have full ownership and are in full control of your data, and may choose to delete it, in part or in whole, at any time. Deleted data is removed fully and permanently from our servers. 

Your data will never be sold or shared with a third party. Only you may access your data and other users of our service cannot view your reports.

### AGGREGATE DATA ANALYSIS AND REPORTS

Because our Service provides iTunes App Store trend analysis in addition to individual app tracking, we provide analysis and reports based off of blinded aggregate data from all of our users. Blinded aggregate data is composite data from multiple members used to provide top-level analysis of the app store. This data will never be displayed or presented in such a manner that your part of the aggregate data is identifiable or can be linked back to you.

You may have your data excluded from any aggregate analysis or report by choosing to opt out of aggregate data analysis. You can do this in your settings page.

### POLICY UPDATES

We may periodically update this policy. We will notify you about significant changes in the way we treat personal information by sending a notice to your email or by placing a prominent notice on our site.

The date of the last update is included at the top of this policy.
