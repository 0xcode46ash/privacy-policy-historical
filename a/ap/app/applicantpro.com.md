# Privacy Policy - ApplicantPro

We understand that your company data and your applicant data is very personal and that every precaution should be taken to ensure it is safe and secure. We understand that challenge and accept it!

#### Privacy and Security Standards

ApplicantPro is committed to privacy of personal information gathered during the application process and stored by the ApplicantPro Applicant Tracking System. It is our policy to respect applicants’ privacy and the privacy of corporate records concerning personal information. If you have any questions regarding our privacy or security standards, please direct your questions to privacy@applicantpro.com. 

ApplicantPro partners with the award winning Rackspace to host and store our data. Here are some of the features that are most important to keeping your data safe and secure:

#### Collecting Information

Personally identifiable information is collected in a number of sections throughout the ApplicantPro application process. Applicants have the choice to enter information by completing an online application via our Applicant Tracking System used by our clients. Applicants are not required to give any personal information during the job searching stage of the application process. All information requested directly relates to the job application process. Applicant data is then stored to allow company managers to use during their hiring process and to allow for future position consideration and placement. ApplicantPro does not collect any Social Security Numbers during any of its processes to protect the financial identity of its applicants. 

#### Protecting Personal Information

Personally identifiable information is stored on a separate server as a security precaution and our site is SSL encrypted. Since, however, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information our users transmit to our site. Having said that, we do everything in our power to protect your company and your applicant’s information.

All applicant information is restricted by administrative login to the ApplicantPRO Applicant Tracking System and controlled by the corporate office. Only administrators who have permission are granted access to personally identifiable information. All ApplicantPro employees are kept up-to-date on security and privacy practices. Additionally, the servers that store personally identifiable information are kept in a secure environment that can only be accessed with a secure login and badge access to the facility. 

#### Data Centers

Your company and your applicants’ information entered into ApplicantPro is maintained and monitored 24 hours a day by Rackspace staff. Proactive network management methodology monitors network route efficiency and maintains network uptime backed by Service Level Agreements. Onsite staff provides additional protection against unauthorized entry as well as security camera monitoring at all data center locations with video surveillance log retention. Data center access is limited to only authorized personnel, badges and biometric scanning are used for controlled data center access

Environmental Controls are in place to help mitigate the risk of service interruption caused by fires, floods, and other forms of natural disasters such as: Flood detection, VESDA / fire suppression, uninterruptable power supplies (minimum N+1) and Diesel generators. Some of the other levels of protection provided by Rackspace are: High-performance bandwidth provided by multiple network providers. Elimination of single points of failure throughout shared network infrastructure. Real-time topology and configuration improvements to adjust for anomalies.

As well as Background screening performed on employees with access to customer accounts.

Rackspace maintains various certifications in security policies and processes for the environment of the hosted infrastructure. The following have been assessed and hold a current validation for compliance frameworks: 

ISO 27001  
SSAE 16 and ISAE 3402 (Previously SAS 70 Type II)  
PCI DSS  
Safe Harbor (export.gov)

Keeping your data and your applicants’ data safe is our number one priority. We take this responsibility very seriously and work hard to keep it secure at every level possible.
