# Privacy Policy | Appodeal Intelligent Ad Mediation

Appodeal, Inc., a Delaware corporation has developed this Privacy Policy (“Policy”) to demonstrate our commitment to protecting our users’ privacy. This Policy describes the information we collect, how that information may be used, with whom it may be shared, and your choices about such uses and disclosures. By using our Website or Services, you agree to the practices described in this Policy. This Policy is an integral part our Terms, which are incorporated by reference. Any capitalized terms used but not defined in this Policy will have the meaning defined in the Terms.

The last update to our Privacy Policy was posted on October 7, 2016.

### COLLECTION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION

Our Website collects both Personal Information and Non-Personal Information.

For the purposes of this Policy, “Personal Information” means information about you, including, your name, address, telephone number, email address, social security number, and, if you transact business with us, financial information such as your payment method (credit card number, expiration date or other financial information). We will only collect, use or disclose Personal Information in accordance with this Policy, or in accordance with laws applicable to the collection, use and disclosure of Personal Information.

“Non-Personal Information” is information that is not personally identifiable to you and that we automatically collect when you access our Service through the Website. Examples of Non-Personal Information are the type of browser you are using or non-personal statistical data.

 _Personal Information_

We collect and store Personal Information that you provide directly to us through the Website during the registration process or otherwise in connection with your use of our Website. When you choose to provide us with your Personal Information you consent to the use of your Personal Information as identified in this Policy and as may be further identified at the time of collection. You can choose not to provide us with your Personal Information, but in that event we may not be able to provide you with full use of the Website or Services.

We may also obtain Personal Information about you through third party websites. By accessing our Website through a third party website, you are allowing us access to your Personal Information made available through that website and/or service in accordance with its own privacy policy to enhance your user account.

 _Non-Personal Information_

We may also automatically collect Non-Personal Information from you when you visit our Website. This information includes your IP address, browser type, language, location data, and access times. Non-Personal Information is collection through various tracking technologies, which may include “cookies,” “web bugs” or “web beacons,” and “mobile device identifiers.”

Cookies are bits of data stored on your device through your browser or mobile application that allows the mobile application to remember you the next time you visit. Cookies enable smoother, more efficient use of the Website by storing your specific information and preferences such as theme, language setting, privacy preferences, and even user ID and password, so you do not need to reenter those each time you visit the Website. Cookies do not link to or store your Personal Information. You may choose to decline cookies if your browser permits, but doing so may affect your use of the Website and your ability to access certain features of the Website. 

We may also use mobile device identifiers (a unique identifier assigned to your device by the manufacturer), instead of cookies, to recognize you. Again, this is done so that we can store your preferences and track your use of the Website.

We may also use web bugs (also called web beacons) help us understand the behavior of our users by allowing us to track user demographics and traffic patterns.

We may also utilize Google Analytics in the collection, compilation and analysis of this information.

We may choose to share reports generated from our use of tracking technologies with advertisers and other third parties in order to better meet the needs of our users and enhance the user experience. None of the information in such reports contains Personal Information of our users. 

We may also combine the Non-Personal Information we collect through tracking technologies with other Person Information we have collected from and about you, however all such Personal Information will be handled strictly in accordance with the terms of this Policy.

### USE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION

We may use your Personal Information for a number of purposes, such as:

  * Surveying our users to measure and improve the effectiveness of the Website and our products;
  * Notification of changes to the Website or products;
  * Collecting other publically available data about our users to enhance user experiences;
  * Tracking and analyzing user preferences;
  * Ensure you have a personalized and consistent experience in using the Website and Services;
  * Protecting the security of our Website;
  * Other legitimate business purposes described in this Policy.



### USER OPTIONS

We limit the collection and use of Personal Information to information that is necessary to fulfill the purposes listed above. We will never collect, sell, distribute or use Personal Information for any other purposes not otherwise set forth herein without your further consent, except as authorized or required by law.

You may be asked to give your express consent to our collection, use or disclosure of Personal Information such as asking you to check a box to indicate your consent to receive marketing communications. Other times, we may infer your implied consent to our collection, use or disclosure of Personal Information by an action you have taken or an action you have decided not to take, such as your implied consent to publish Personal Information after you have provided us with such Personal Information in order to create your account.

You may notify us at any time that you wish to withdraw or change your consent to our use and disclosure of your information. We will accommodate your request subject to legal and contractual restrictions.

### DISCLOSURE AND SHARING OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION

We do not sell or license your Personal Information to any other party. However, in the normal course of business, we may share Personal Information we collect with our corporate subsidiaries, affiliates or divisions for internal business purposes in accordance with this Policy. In that case, we will ensure that your Personal Information is handled in strict accordance with this Policy.

We may use third party service providers (for example, web hosting providers, data management providers and/or payment processers) to manage one of more aspects of our business operations, including the processing or handing of Personal Information. When we do use an outside company, we use contractual or other appropriate means to ensure that your Personal Information is used in a manner that is consistent with this Policy.

By registering and providing your payment information, including but not limited to credit card details, we will use the payment information you provide to bill you for the Service. By providing your payment information details to us, you consent to and authorize us to provide your payment information to payment processors and financial institutions necessary to process your payment.

We may disclose your Personal Information as permitted or required by applicable law. For example, we may be compelled to release information by a court of law or other person or entity with jurisdiction to compel production of such information. If we have reasonable grounds to believe information could be useful in the investigation of improper or unlawful activity, we may disclose information to law enforcement agencies or other appropriate investigative bodies.

### SECURITY OF PERSONAL INFORMATION

The security of your Personal Information is important to us. We maintain appropriate safeguards and current security standards to protect your Personal Information from unauthorized access, disclosure, or misuse, such as using SSL encryption. However, no system can be completely secure. While we take meaningful steps to secure your information, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your Personal Information will always remain secure.

### REQUESTS FOR ACCESS TO AND CORRECTION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION

You can review and change certain Personal Information related to your use of our Website (such as your name and contact information). To access your information, simply sign in to your account and you will be able to edit your Personal Information.
