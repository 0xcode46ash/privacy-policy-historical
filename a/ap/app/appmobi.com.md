### appMobi lets you painlessly develop open source cross platform apps

Open source apps can be developed using appMobi’s free open source pricing model. We offer a type of app account that is designed for pure open source and there are only a few rules – first, your source code is available to anyone in a public section of the appMobi site, second, neither appMobi nor the developer can make any money from the app. That means no advertising, no in-app charges, nothing. It’s that simple. Open Source Mobile Apps are easy to make using appMobi’s open source pricing plan. 

  


### appMobi loves PhoneGap

appMobi is the only PhoneGap hosted solution in the world. PhoneGap developers can use appMobi’s SAAS PAAS software as a service platform as a service to build, debug and deploy their PhoneGap apps, whether those apps are for the Apple iPhone, the Apple iPad, the Apple iPod Touch, or Android devices like the Google G1, the Google Nexus 1, or Droid, Droid X, Droid Incredible, or any Android-based tablet devices.

  


### Mobile app development, in the cloud

appMobi is the only cloud-based app development environment in the world. We leverage the rock solid 24-7-365 dependability of Amazon’s AWS, Amazon DevPay, and Amazon EC2 services to deliver an amazingly agile and hassle-free development environment. Because appMobi moves the SDK into the “Cloud”, you are free to develop on whatever PC you wish to use (Windows PC, Apple Mac, Linux based) and you are free to develop using whatever text editing tools you like (eMacs, Notepad ++, Crimson, Bluefish, VIM, Komodo, Visual Studio, EditPlus, TextMate, Aptana, Eclipse, Aptana, Netbean). 

  


### Develop your apps rapidly using web technologies like HTML5 and CSS

Rapid app development means developing your app without the need to install, configure and learn Apple’s Tool set, which includes a Macintosh, XCode, Interface Builder. Objective C is known to be one of the more difficult variants of C to learn, and it’s further complicated by the need to learn Apple’s 1200 plus API libraries. Rapid app development means bypassing all of that for the ease of HTML, HTML5, CSS, CSS3, and JavaScript coding. That’s Rapid native app development. 

### appMobi’s development platform is extensible with PlugIns 

appMobi offers the web developer the ability to rapidly create native mobile apps using the skills and tools they already possess. appMobi’s recent 3.0 version enables device manufacturers and third party software vendors to create “plugins” that extend the appMobi functionality to use their hardware or software tools. For example, a mobile ad network has created a plugin that allows appMobi developers to instantly access their ad inventory and traffic system using just one line of JavaScript. 

  


### New! Develop cross-platform augmented reality apps quickly and easily

Now you can develop apps using augmented reality using appMobi. AppMobi’s new augmented reality features allow you to create cutting edge apps that use the device’s camera to bring the real world into the app, where your app overlays information onto the video for gaming, direction finding, shopping, or whatever. Augmented reality is certain to be a driver of mobile commerce in the coming years and appMobi gives you high performance augmented reality capability now.
