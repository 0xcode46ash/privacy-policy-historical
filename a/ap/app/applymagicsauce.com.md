Cookies provide information regarding the computer used by a visitor. We use cookies on this site to gather information about your computer in order to enhance your experience and enable certain features.

We use self-expiring session cookies for the purpose of maintaining the test session for a given user.

We also use cookies for Google Analytics, Facebook Social Plugins and Twitter Social Plugins.
