**Questions & Answers:**

**Who is Inside Network?**

Inside Network, based in Palo Alto, California, delivers data and research that helps leading analysts understand the state and future of the Facebook Platform and social gaming ecosystem. Thousands of developers, investors, marketers, brands, and analysts use Inside Network to help them make decisions daily. Our data is drawn from multiple sources and comprises the most in-depth resource in the industry. Our proprietary technology aggregates and normalizes the data to ensure it is as comprehensive and accurate as possible.

Inside Network processes personal information only for the purposes for which it was collected and in accordance with this Policy. We take reasonable steps to ensure that the personal information we process is accurate, complete, and current, but we depend on our users to update or correct their personal information whenever necessary.

**What information do we collect at this website?**

At Inside Network, we offer a number of services that do not require you to register for an account or provide any personal information to us, such as AppData, Inside Facebook, and Inside Social Games. However, some of our Services will require the provision of certain personal information. In order to provide our full range of services, we may collect the following types of information:

**Information you provide**

When you sign up for a AppData Pro account or other Inside Network services or promotions that requires registration, we sometimes ask you for personal information (such as your e-mail address and an account password). For certain services, such as our premium offerings, we also request credit card or other payment account information which will be maintained by third party merchant(s) or payment processor(s) in encrypted form on secure servers. We may combine the information you submit under your account with information from other Inside Network services or third parties in order to provide you with a better experience and to improve the quality of our services. For certain services, we may give you the opportunity to opt out of combining such information.

AppData Pro member e-mail addresses are used to contact members regarding service updates, confirmations, opt-in surveys and select partner offers. If you would like to opt-out of these e-mails, please see the Opt-out section within e-mails you receive from us. You may also contact us using the contact information listed below. If you elect to opt-out of further communications, such opt-out will apply only to marketing messages and not to communications regarding service updates and similar matters.

Some Inside Network e-mail updates are administered by a 3rd party service provider. E-mail addresses provided to them via the automated form on the blog are used solely for the purpose of sending you blog alerts.

When you contact us via our Contact form, send e-mail or other communication to Inside Network, we may retain those communications in order to process your inquiries, respond to your requests and improve our services.

**Cookies, Beacons and Site Logging**

To serve you faster and with better quality, we use "cookies" technology. Cookies are small bits of code, usually stored on a user's computer hard drive, which enable a website to "personalize" itself for each user. We generally use cookies to reduce the time it takes for pages to load on your computer and to assist with customer tracking. Cookies are not tied to your personal information.

When you use Inside Network services, our servers automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website. These server logs may include information such as your web request, Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser.

**Are there any other third parties with whom we share your information?**

Inside Network only shares personal information with individuals outside of Inside Network as disclosed in this Privacy Policy and in the following limited circumstances: we have a good faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of information is reasonably necessary to (a) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request, (b) enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations thereof, (c) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues, (d) protect against imminent harm to the rights, property or safety of Inside Network, its users or the public as required or permitted by law, (e) allow service providers and/or vendors to fulfill Services for you on behalf of Inside Network or (f) pursuant to an acquisition, merger, sale of assets or other business transfer.

**What is our policy regarding children's privacy?**

You must be at least 13 years old to use the Inside Network services. We do not knowingly collect or use personal information about visitors under 13 years of age. If you are under 13 years of age, you can use the services offered on our website only in conjunction with your parents or guardians.

**What security measures do we have in place to ensure that your data is kept securely?**

We take reasonable security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of personal information. These measures include internal reviews of our data collection, storage and processing practices and security practices.

We restrict access to personal information to Inside Network employees, contractors and agents who need to know that information in order to operate, develop or improve our services. We take reasonable efforts to ensure all parties comply with confidentiality obligations.

We store all personal information on our servers in the United States of America.

**How would we inform you if our privacy practices change?**

Please note that this policy may change from time to time. We will post any policy changes on this page and, if the changes are significant, we will provide a more prominent notice (including, for certain services, e-mail notification of policy changes). By using our services, you signify your assent to the Inside Network Privacy Statement. Our Privacy Statement will indicate the date it was last updated. Your continued use of our site will signify your acceptance of the changes to our policy.
