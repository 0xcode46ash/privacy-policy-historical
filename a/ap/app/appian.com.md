# Privacy Information | Appian BPM

## Information collected:

Appian Corporation and its subsidiaries (together, “Appian”) respect the privacy of visitors to its websites, as a result, we have developed this Internet Privacy Policy. This Internet Privacy Policy applies only to the operation of websites that directly link to this Policy when you click on “Privacy Policy” in the website footer. Through this website Appian will collect information that can identify you, such as your name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, job title, and other similar information (“Your Information”) when it is voluntarily submitted to us. Any other information transferred by you in connection with your visit to this site (“Other Information” – that is, information that cannot be used to identify you) may be included in databases owned and maintained by Appian or its agents. Appian retains all rights to these databases and the information contained in them. Other Information we collect may include your IP Address and other information gathered through our weblogs and cookies (see below).  You should be aware that our websites are not intended for, or designed to attract, individuals under the age of 18. We do not collect personally identifiable information from any person we actually know is an individual under the age of 18.

## Use of information:

We will use Your Information to respond to requests you may make of us.  We may also use Your Information to contact you and/or provide you with general information about our products, services, partners, promotions and events. We may use the information collected to better improve our websites, products and services. We may also enhance or merge Your Information with data obtained from third parties for the same purposes.

Appian does not share, sell, rent, or trade personally identifiable information with third parties for their promotional purposes.  Appian may share information with other companies that work on Appian’s behalf or that partner with Appian.

Appian’s policy is to restrict these affiliates, subsidiaries, agents, contractors or partners from using shared information in any way other than to provide services for Appian, or services for the collaboration in which they and Appian are engaged.

## Our Website Technology:

Cookies:  Our websites may use a technology called a “cookie”. A cookie is a piece of information that our webserver sends to your computer (actually to your browser file) when you access a website. Then when you come back our site will detect whether you have one of our cookies on your computer. Our cookies help provide additional functionality to the site and help us analyze site usage more accurately. For instance, our site may set a cookie on your browser that keeps you from needing to remember and then enter a password more than once during a visit to the site. We allow carefully selected third parties to place cookies via our website. These cookies track your use of our website by collecting anonymous statistics. We do not have access to or control over these cookies or other means of passive data collection. If you are based in the European Union you can learn more about how third parties use these types of cookies by visiting [www.youronlinechoices.eu](http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/). If you are based in the United States, please visit [www.aboutads.info](http://www.aboutads.info/). You do not have to accept all cookies used by our website; however, depending on the particular cookie you reject, you may not be able to use some of the features of the website. Depending on the type of browser you are using, your browser’s default settings may allow all cookies to be set. Your browser may also be configured to alert you to any cookies it comes across and/or it may allow all cookies to be set. To change your web browser settings for cookies, follow the instructions in the help section of your web browser (or please visit [www.allaboutcookies.org](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/)).

IP Addresses:  Our websites use Internet Protocol (IP) Addresses. An IP Address is a number assigned to your computer by your Internet service provider so you can access the Internet. Generally, an IP address changes each time you connect to the Internet (it is a “dynamic” address). Note, however, that if you have a broadband connection, depending on your individual circumstance, it is possible that your IP Address that we collect, or even perhaps a cookie we use, may contain information that could be deemed identifiable. This is because with some broadband connections your IP Address doesn’t change (it is “static”) and could be associated with your personal computer. We use your IP address to report aggregate information on use and to help improve our websites.

Web Beacons:  Our websites may use a technology known as web beacons – sometimes called single-pixel gifs – that allow this site to collect web log information. A web beacon is a graphic on a web page or in an e-mail message designed to track pages viewed or messages opened. Web log information is gathered when you visit one of our websites by the computer that hosts our website (called a “webserver”). The webserver automatically recognizes some non-personal information, such as the date and time you visited our site, the pages you visited, the website you came from, the type of browser you are using (e.g., Internet Explorer), the type of operating system you are using (e.g., Windows 7), and the domain name and address of your Internet service provider. We may also include web beacons in promotional e-mail messages in order to determine whether messages have been opened.

Encryption:  Areas of our websites that collect Your Information use industry standard secure socket layer encryption (SSL); however, to take advantage of this your browser must support encryption protection (found in Internet Explorer release 3.0 and above).

Security:  We use reasonable physical, electronic, and administrative safeguards to protect your personal information from loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction.

## Communication Preferences:

Every marketing email from Appian includes information on how to opt out of receiving future marketing emails and an “unsubscribe” link located at the bottom of the email.  Another way to be removed from our contact lists is to contact Appian using the Contact Information displayed below.  You may also remove yourself from our distribution list by sending a request [info@appian.com](mailto:info@appian.com). Please note that you may continue to receive materials while we are updating our lists.

## International Transfers:

Appian exchanges information, including personal information, between various subsidiary companies and their operations, worldwide, all as necessary to provide the services requested from Appian by its customers or for general administrative purposes.  Appian may also use facilities or contractors worldwide to process or back-up information or to provide certain services to Appian.

Appian and all of its affiliated entities comply with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information transferred from the European Union to the United States.  Appian has certified to the Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles.  If there is any conflict between the terms in this privacy policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern.  To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view our certification, please visit <https://www.privacyshield.gov/>.

Additionally, Appian can also offer customers and partners a data processing addendum containing the E.U. model clauses upon request.

Appian’s policy is to require our third party providers to either subscribe to the Privacy Shield Principals, be subject to the EU Privacy Directive or another adequacy finding, or enter into a written agreement that requires them to provide at least the same level of privacy protection as is required by the EU Privacy Directive, including the so-called “Model Clauses”.

In compliance with the Privacy Shield Principles, Appian commits to resolve complaints about our collection or use of your personal information.  European Union individuals with inquiries or complaints regarding our Privacy Shield policy should first contact Appian at:

Cathy Lazarus

[cathy.lazarus@appian.com](mailto:cathy.lazarus@appian.com)

Appian commits to cooperate with the panel established by the EU data protection authorities (DPAs) and comply with the advice given by the panel with regard to both personal data and human resources data transferred from the EU.  Additionally, the Federal Trade Commission has jurisdiction over Appian’s compliance with the Privacy Shield.  Finally, each individual has the possibility, under certain conditions, to invoke binding arbitration for complaints regarding Privacy Shield compliance not resolved by any of the other Privacy Shield mechanisms.  This link to Annex I contains additional information about this: <https://www.privacyshield.gov/article?id=ANNEX-I-introduction>.
