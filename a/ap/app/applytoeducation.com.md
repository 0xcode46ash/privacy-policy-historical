We do not disclose your personal information, combined personal and demographic information or information about your use of **_apply_** to **education** (such as the areas you visit or the services you access) to third parties, except as set forth in the following three subparagraphs. 

  1. We may disclose such information only as is necessary to third parties who are employed by us or retained by us by contract to perform functions on our behalf, including the hosting of web servers, processing credit card transactions and providing customer service. The employees and independent contractors employed by us are governed by the privacy laws of Canada and by **_apply_** to **education** ’s privacy policy. 
  2. We may disclose such information if legally required to do so, if requested to do so by a governmental entity or if we believe in good faith that such action is necessary to: conform to legal requirements or comply with legal process; protect the rights or property of **_apply_** to **education** ; prevent a crime or protect national security; or protect the personal safety of applicants or the public. 
  3. We may disclose and transfer such information to a third party who acquires all or a substantial portion of **_apply_** to **education** 's business, whether such acquisition is by way of merger, consolidation or purchase of all or a substantial portion of our assets. In addition, in the event **_apply_** to **education** becomes the subject of a bankruptcy proceeding, whether voluntary or involuntary, **_apply_** to **education** or its trustee in bankruptcy may sell, license or otherwise dispose of such information in a transaction approved by the bankruptcy court. 



**_apply_** to **education** may also share collected anonymous information about visitors to our site (for example, the number of visitors per month) with its clients, partners and other third parties so they understand the kinds of visitors to **_apply_** to **education** and the use of the site. 

**_apply_** to **education** supplies technology, hosting, and related services to employers to help them manage applications on-line. Personal and/or general information supplied by an applicant becomes part of the **_apply_** to **education** database, but it is not accessible by anyone other than the applicant, **_apply_** to **education** , and the employer(s) selected by the applicant to view his/her application or by the employers whose jobs the applicant applies to. 

**Applications**

**_apply_** to **education** is a web-based software that enables applicants to search job postings free of charge, e-file one comprehensive application portfolio and e-courier their application portfolio to multiple jobs posted by multiple employers on **_apply_** to **education** . In addition to the provisions of this Privacy Policy, the collection, use and distribution of the application is governed by the [Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/Common/AttTermsOfUse.aspx). There are two options available to applicants once their application is submitted into our on-line database and has an ‘Active’ credit: 

  1. The application can be stored in our database and set to ‘not visible’ by the applicant so it is not searchable by School Boards and/or Private Employers. Not allowing the application to be searchable means it can be used to apply for a job online, but School Boards and Private Employers will not have access to search it through our application database. 
  2. The application can be stored in our database and set to ‘visible’ by the applicant so it can be viewed by employers the applicant has selected and by employers whose job postings the applicant has applied to.



We limit access to our searchable application database (or copies thereof) to School Boards and Private Employers. Once an applicant has made his/her application available to employers through **_apply_** to **education** , **_apply_** to **education** cannot control how those employers use the information. Applicants should check with specific employer’s privacy policies to ensure the use of information is limited to the purpose of obtaining employment. An applicant can remove his/her application from our searchable database at any time. However, School Boards and Private Employers who have access to our database may have retained a copy of their application in their own files or databases. We are not responsible for the retention, use or privacy of applications in these instances.
