Conversely, the service provider may provide Apptivo with personal program information about the products you qualify for. 

We also may enter into strategic marketing alliances with third parties, such as strategic partners and affiliates, who may be given access to personal information, including your name, address, and email, for the purpose of providing you with information about products and services that may be of interest to you. We evaluate such partners to identify products and services that serve the needs of our members well.

We also may disclose your personal information in order to investigate network abuse or a violation of any of our Terms and Conditions of Use or other published guidelines, or if you engage in (or are reasonably suspected of engaging in) any illegal activities. We reserve the right to report any suspected illegal activity to law enforcement for investigation or prosecution.

We may share aggregated demographic and statistical information with our partners. This is not linked to any personal information that can identify any individual person. 

**Aggregate Information ******

Aggregate information refers to information your computer automatically provides to us and that is not tied back to you as a specific individual. Examples include referral data (the web sites you visited just before and just after our site), the pages viewed, time spent at our Apptivo SaaSand IP (Internet Protocol) addresses. An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you surf the Internet. When you request a page from our Apptivo SaaS, our servers log your IP address to create aggregate reports on user demographics and traffic patterns for advertisers and partners, and for purposes of system administration. We use this aggregated information to determine consumer trends and needs, which allows both Apptivo and our partners to advertise more effectively, and allows you to receive advertisements that are less duplicative and more relevant to your interests. 

**Log Files**

Apptivo uses IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track users’ movements, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. We do not link your IP address to other personally identifiable information about you.
