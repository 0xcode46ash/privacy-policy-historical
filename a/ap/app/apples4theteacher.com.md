**INFORMATION WE COLLECT**

**Non-Personally Identifiable Information.**  
As part of our on-going efforts to ensure the best possible experience for all recipients of ValueClick Media advertising, we may use log files, web beacons and cookies to collect data from browsers, advertiser and third party sites (“Sites”) to aggregate Information. The Information collected is used for marketing purposes, enables us to determine which advertisements perform well, allows us to more effectively match advertisements and website content to your interests, assists us in improving the operation of our services, helps us to maintain the quality of our services, enhances our services to our business partners and clients and enables us to provide general statistics to our business partners and clients regarding use of ValueClick Media’s services.

“Log files” track actions occurring on Sites and collect data including your IP address, browser type, Internet service provider, referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, click data and types of advertisements viewed.

"Web beacons" are electronic files used to track your navigation of a website or collection of sites, the completion of transactions, submittal of applications and browsing behavior.

"Cookies" are files (e.g. HTTP cookies) that are stored on your Internet enabled device (which includes your computer, BlackBerry or other PDA). Cookies are used to improve the experience web users have when they see web advertisements and ensure that when a web user clicks on an advertisement, they are sent to the correct click-through destination. We may use Cookies to estimate the total reach of an advertising campaign, as well as frequency of display. This allows advertisers to determine with greater accuracy the composition of the audience they reach. Cookies are also used to control the delivery of a series of advertisements to a web browser, and to limit the number of times a web browser receives any one advertisement.

There are two classes of Cookies based on how long they remain on your system: (i) “Session Cookies” are used only during your visit to the Sites and are erased once you close your browser, and (ii) “Persistent Cookies” remain on your browser for 2 years from your last visit to the Sites and enable us to remember you on subsequent visits to the Sites and provide more relevant content to you on such Sites.

There are many misconceptions about Cookies, some of which we will try to address in this policy. Cookies cannot erase your hard drive or otherwise damage your computer and do not tell us an e-mail address or any other PII. ValueClick Media does not and cannot use Cookies or web beacons to retrieve PII from your computer.

A useful resource on understanding Cookies may be found at [http://www.allaboutcookies.org](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/).

**Cox Digital Solutions Corporation, as a Third Party Vendor**

**Cox Digital Solutions Corporation: Privacy Policy for Consumers & Opt-Out Program**  
January 2011

Cox Digital Solutions is committed to privacy and to giving you choice in the advertising that you view. This privacy policy explains the types of data we collect, how we use it, and how long we keep it. We also provide you with the ability to opt out from receiving targeted advertising from advertisers and publishers (i.e., website owners) using our services. 

**What we DON’T Collect:** Cox Digital Solutions does not collect any personally identifiable information. This is information that would allow someone to know both your name and contact or financial information such as a telephone number, email address, complete street address, or credit card number. 

**About Children:** Children are people too. We don’t collect children’s (or anyone else’s) personal information. 

**What do we Collect?** To deliver the most relevant advertising to you, Cox Digital Solutions collects anonymous data when you visit a site that uses our services. That data may include the URL of the site or page you visited, your IP address (which provides some level of geographic detail more general than zip codes), the time of day, and the category of ads that were presented to you or that you interacted with. We may collect information regarding the interaction (for example, pausing or rewinding a video advertisement). We may collect information that tells us what led you to the site within Cox Digital Solutions (referring URL or search query). This information is stored on our servers with a random numeric id – and we store that numeric ID, encrypted, in your browser as a cookie. Collectively, we refer to all of this information as “cookie targeting data”. None of this information can be used to personally identify you. 

**What we do with the data we collect:** Using the cookie targeting data, we can specify characteristics shared by groups of users that may be desired for an advertising campaign (we only target ads against aggregated information). We can also use cookie targeting data to affect the number of times you are presented with a particular ad or set of ads within a period of time (so-called “frequency-capping”). For example, a pet food producer would like to present its product to consumers who live in the San Francisco Bay Area and are possibly interested, based on browsing history, in pets. If we determine that the Cox Digital Solutions cookie on your browser may be associated with viewing pet-related website and with an IP address in the San Francisco Bay Area, you may be more likely to be presented with an advertisement from that producer. And we determine otherwise, you may be less likely to be presented with an advertisement from that producer. Cox Digital Solutions does not have a mechanism for advertisers to know the personal identity of the person receiving the targeted advertisements. We may share with third parties aggregated, non-personally identifiable information, such as the number of users who visit a publisher site or the number of users who clicked on a particular advertisement. This information does not identify you individually. The examples of our use of cookie targeting information are not comprehensive. In general, we will use cookie targeted data to facilitate the requirements of advertisers so long as such use does not personally identify you. Website Privacy Policies. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of the websites that you visit. You should contact website publishers directly should you have questions concerning their use of your information such as, for example, communications you may or may not wish to receive. 

**How long do we keep the Data?** Cox Digital Solutions stores cookie targeting data is for 60 days. Certain data, such as the category of ads on specific sites and pages are retained, in aggregate, to inform our decision engine for serving the most relevant ads to any consumer on a non-targeted basis. Frequency-capping cookie data is retained on the consumer’s browser for as long as specified in specific campaign requirements. Cox Digital Solutions’s servers do not store frequency-capping cookie data. 

**Opt Out Program.** As part of our commitment to giving you control and transparency, we provide you with a way to determine if your browser has an Cox Digital Solutions cookie and a way to opt-out of receiving cookie-targeted online ads from networks hosted on Cox Digital Solutions’s platform.
