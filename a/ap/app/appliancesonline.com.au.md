# Privacy Policy - Appliances Online

At Appliances Online, we take your privacy seriously. It’s pretty simple. We won’t do anything with the personal information you give us that we wouldn’t want done with our own personal information. 

## We do store some information - but not your credit card number

To allow us to process your order we will collect and store your delivery and contact information. 

We don’t store any credit card information on our web site. We pass it onto our bank for processing. We do however keep hold of the last 4 digits for verification of your card on delivery. 

## If we need to get in contact with you?

If you give us your email address or phone number when you send us a message through the contact-us form, or you send in a question, or you report a lower price, then we will hang onto it so we can get in contact with you in response. 

If we use your contribution on our site we make sure to remove any personally identifiable information. 

If you send us an email or give us a call we will keep a record so we know who you talked to. 

##  3rd parties? 

We don’t share your information with everyone. 

However, if you subscribe to our newsletter we will store your email address on our mailing list on a 3rd party service. 

To help other customers we also ask for feedback from you about your purchase. To do this, we give your name, email address and product ordered to Feefo, an independent customer feedback forum. If you don’t want us to do that, give us a call within 14 days of your order.
