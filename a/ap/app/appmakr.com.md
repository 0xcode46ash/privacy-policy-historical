Last updated on October 24th, 2011.

AppMakr is an online platform (the “Service”) provided by Socialize, Inc., f.k.a. PointAbout, Inc. (the “Company,” “we”), on AppMakr.com that acts as a portal through which developers (the “Developers,” “you”) can create mobile applications (the “Apps”) with various types of media for their end users (the “End-Users”). This Privacy Policy (the "Privacy Policy") describes the privacy practices that the Company employs with regard to information, including personal information, that it collects and receives from Developers and End-Users who use or access the Service.

**Third-Party Websites and Links** ****

You may be directed to other sites that are developed and administered by people or companies not affiliated with the Company. Such third party sites may place their own cookies on your computer, collect data or solicit personal information. This Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of such third parties. You are responsible for reviewing any third-party site's privacy policy, as it may be different from this Privacy Policy. The Company is not responsible for the actions of such third parties, the content of their sites, the use of information you provide to such third parties, or any products or services they may offer. Any link to such third party sites on the Service does not constitute the Company’s sponsorship of, or affiliation with, such third parties.Additionally, this Privacy Policy does not govern the privacy practices of the Developers and Developer Apps created using the Service, as the Developers and Developer Apps are not controlled by the Company. However, Developers are bound by the Company’s Terms of Service in order to use the Service. It is expected that Developers respect the privacy of their End-users, but the Company cannot be held responsible for the actions and practices of the Developers. 

**Consent** ****

By registering with or submitting information through our Service, Developers and their End-Users agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy and they expressly consent to the collection, use and disclosure of their information, including personal information made available in use of the Service, in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

**Information Collection and Use** ****

The Company collects information as described below. The Company uses information that we collect to create accounts; fulfill requests for the Service; improve our website, products and Service; contact Developers; conduct research; create reports for internal use and to fulfill the actions described below. Some specific types of information that the Company may collect and use (directly or through our third party service providers) include but are not limited to the following:

1.              From Developers. If you are an Developer, we may collect the following:

a.              Your name or your company name, your email, App name and App platform(s), and other information as required to access the Service. We use this information to facilitate the relationship between the Service and you as a Developer using the Service.

b.              Cookies. The Company uses "cookies" to keep and track your information. A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user's computer for record-keeping purposes. We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. We use session cookies to make it easier for you to navigate the Website. A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. We set a persistent cookie to store your password if you choose "auto login" so that you don't have to enter it more than once. We also store your display resolution and whether JavaScript is enabled in your browser to enhance your user experience. You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser's help file. However, removing cookies may result in you not being able to take full advantage of the features of the Service.

c.              Web Beacons. The Company uses web beacons to keep and track your information. A "web beacon" is an electronic image placed in the code of a web page. We use web beacons to monitor the traffic patterns of users from one page to another and to improve overall site performance.

2.              From End-Users. If you are using an App created using the Service, the Company may collect the following:

a.              Device-Specific Information. Device-specific information includes the following information about an End-User’s device: a hashed version of the unique device ID assigned to your iOS device, a hashed version of the device identifier associated with your Android or Windows Phone device, platform type and version (e.g. iOS v4, Android, etc.), hardware and processor type, screen resolution and human-readable description. The Company may use a one-way algorithm to hash IDs—the hashed versions of device IDs that the Company stores may not be converted back to recognizable device ID.

b.              App-Specific Information. App-specific information is information about each End-User and the App they are using. This information may include App name, user ID, data related to downloading the app, data related to authorization within the app, device-specific information as defined in the preceding section, total sessions and duration, and geo-location data. The Company may share App-specific information with the Developer who owns the App.

c.              Analytics Data. When you click on or look at certain items, we may store the data and use it for our internal analytics to improve our Service. This information includes but is not limited to the session ID, user ID or username, and session length. We may share all or some of this analytics data with Developers. Additional data may be collected in the future with or without notice.

a.              Information You Provide. If you provide us feedback or contact us via e-mail, we will collect your name and e-mail address, as well as any other content included in the e-mail, in order to send you a reply. When you participate in one of our surveys, we may collect additional profile information.

b.              Third Party Tools. The Service may also contain third party tracking tools from our service providers (e.g. Google Analytics). Such third parties may use cookies, APIs and SDKs in our services to enable them to collect and analyze End-User information on our behalf. While a third party may have access to your personal information in connection with the performance of the Service, it may not use such information for any purpose other than providing its services.

c.              Anonymous Information. We may create anonymous information records from personal information by excluding information (such as your name) that make the data personally identifiable to you. We use this anonymous information to analyze request and usage patterns so that we may enhance the content of our website, products and services. The Company reserves the right to use anonymous information for any purpose and disclose anonymous information to third parties in its sole discretion.
