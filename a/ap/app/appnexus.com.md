## Privacy Practices for Our Platform

### Overview of the AdNexus Platform

AdNexus offers an advertising technology platform (“Platform”) that enables our Clients to buy and sell online advertising. Some of our Clients may collect Non-PII about an Internet user’s web surfing habits, and use that Non-PII to deliver more relevant advertising via the Platform. Similarly, we sometimes obtain Non-PII from our data partners and enable our Clients to use that Non-PII via the Platform. And we collect Non-PII via the Platform for ad delivery and reporting purposes. Generally, an Internet user's computer comes into contact with the Platform when he or she visits a website, or views an ad that is delivered by the Platform. The ads delivered by the Platform are sent from the domain adnxs.com. 

We contractually require Clients to adhere to online privacy and security laws in their use of the Platform. We also prohibit Clients from importing PII into the Platform, or otherwise using PII on the Platform. And we take reasonable steps to avoid receiving PII from Clients via the Platform. However, as a technology Platform, we are unable to be in complete control of the type of information that our Clients import into the Platform. 

## Types of Information We Collect Via the Platform

### Personally Identifiable Information

We don't collect Personally Identifiable Information (“PII”) via the Platform, and take reasonable measures to avoid receiving PII from Clients via the Platform.

### Cookies and Web beacons

Our Clients use cookies in conjunction with Web beacons when they use the Platform in order to help make the online advertisements you see more relevant to you. We also use cookies and Web beacons (under the domain adnxs.com) to help our clients make advertising more relevant. We also use cookies and web beacons for ad delivery and reporting purposes, to measure the success of our Clients’ online advertising campaigns.

This includes, but is not limited to the use of encryption. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. If you have any questions about our security practices, please send an email to us at [adnxs-privacy@adnexus.com](mailto:adnxs-privacy@adnexus.com).

## Disclosure of Information to Third Parties

We do not collect PII via the Platform, and we do not sell, rent or share PII collected on the Website with non-affiliated third parties without your consent. We may, however, share your PII with trusted third party contractors who provide services for us. These third party contractors are prohibited from using the information we provide for purposes other than performing services for us. 

We may share Non-PII collected via the Platform with Clients. Similarly, we may enhance the Non-PII collected via the Platform with Non-PII collected from Clients. 

We may disclose your information to third parties when we reasonably believe we are obligated to do so by law, and in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding suspected or actual prohibited activities, including but not limited to, fraud and situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person. 

Finally, we may transfer information, including any PII, to a successor entity in connection with a corporate merger, consolidation, sale of assets, bankruptcy, or other corporate change.
