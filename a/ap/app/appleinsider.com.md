# Apple News and rumors since 1997 | AppleInsider

Internet user privacy is of paramount importance to AppleInsider.com and its related sites. The success of our business depends upon our ability to maintain the trust of our users. Below is information regarding AppleInsider's commitment to protect the privacy of users and to ensure the integrity of the Internet. 

**User Information**

During your visit to the site, AppleInsider does not collect any personally-identifiable information about you beyond what you specifically volunteer. This information may be volunteered when you create an account through the AppleInsider discussion forums or article comment system. However, even then, AppleInsider does not use that stored information for any purpose other than to allow you to log in and post messages. 

AppleInsider does, however, automatically collect certain non-personally-identifiable information about you, such as your browser type and the IP address that your ISP designates to your machine (which, usually changes periodically depending of your type of Internet connection). This is standard practice for web sites, and is not used for any purpose other than to statistically evaluate how we can design the site to best serve your needs. This information is not sold to any third parties or available to anybody outside of the AppleInsider staff. 

**Cookies**

Along with countless other Web sites, AppleInsider uses cookies to enhance your experience. Cookies are used in the AppleInsider discussion forums to keep track of which messages have been posted since your last visit, easing the navigation of the forums. Cookies can also store your user name and password so that you do not have to log in each time you want to post a message or article comment, though you must specifically request that this feature be turned on. Other user settings such as preferred site display options are also managed by cookies. 

Cookie data is not stored on the server, and therefore, not available for viewing by AppleInsider staff or any third parties. However, it is possible that security flaws exist in some browsers that would allow other site administrators to write malicious scripts that would collect this data without AppleInsider's knowledge, though this is quite unlikely. 

If you would like to opt-out of Non Personally Identifiable Information (PII) cookie tracking, please visit the NAI opt-out page here: <http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/>. 

**Third-party Ad Server**

A portion of the advertisements displayed on the AppleInsider Network are served by third-party advertisement providers, including Advertising.com, TribalFusion, Google, and Federated Media. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements on this site and other sites about goods and services that may be of interest to you. 

Please visit the National Advertising Initiative's [opt-out management page](http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp) for further information or to opt-out of behavioral advertising from many providers. 

We are committed to continuing to protect the privacy of our readers. If you have any additional questions, please contact us at Privacy@AppleInsider.com. 

We recommend that you review this Privacy Statement periodically, as AppleInsider may update it from time to time without notice to its users.
