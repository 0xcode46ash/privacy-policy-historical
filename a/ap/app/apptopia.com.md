## The Information We Collect

We may collect the following personal information during the registration process (e.g. name, email address, and company name) (“Personally Indentifiable Information” or “PII”). We also collect a variety of non-identifying visitor data, much of it automatically, such as IP addresses, browser settings and history, ISP information, referring/exit pages, operating systems, date/time stamps, search inquiries, and clickstream data (collectively “Non-Personal Information”). We use Non-Personal Information to analyze trends, to administer the site, to measure users’ activity on the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We do link this automatically collected data to PII. When referring to both PII and Non-Personal Information collectively, we will refer to it as “User Information”.

## Cookies, Web Beacons, and Other Technologies

We may use the standard cookie feature of major browser applications and third-party provides, or employ internally developed cookies and tracking codes, that allows Apptopia to store a small piece of data on a User’s computer (or any other device used to access the Services, including a mobile device) about the User’s use of the Site. It’s a text-only string of information that allows us to distinguish you from other Users, but not in a personally identifiable way. We do capture PII in cookies or use cookies to mine PII.
