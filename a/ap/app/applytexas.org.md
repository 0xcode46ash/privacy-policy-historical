# ApplyTexas Web Privacy Statement

The administrators of ApplyTexas are committed to ensuring the privacy and accuracy of your confidential information. We do not actively share personal information gathered from our Web servers. However, because [www.applytexas.org](https://www.applytexas.org/) is administered by a state agency, some information collected from the ApplyTexas Web site, including the summary server log information, e-mails sent to the Web site, and information collected from Web-based forms, may be subject to the Texas Public Information Act. This means that while we do not actively share information, in some cases we may be compelled by law to release information gathered from our Web servers.

As part of our commitment to maintain the privacy of our Web users, the [Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board](http://www.thecb.state.tx.us/index.cfm?objectid=A705EC74-EE7C-E0CD-53EEE0BBCF66B602) has developed this privacy statement. The statement has two purposes:

  1. To educate users about privacy issues
  2. To inform users about specific privacy policies and guidelines employed by the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board



Texas public universities also comply with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), which prohibits the release of education records without student permission. For more details on FERPA, currently enrolled students should see the University's General Information Catalog. 

ApplyTexas contains links to several external Web sites. The administrators of ApplyTexas are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of the external Web sites to which we link.

### Information We Gather

Our Web servers generate temporary logs that contain the following information:

  * Internet address of computer being used
  * Web pages requested
  * Referring Web page
  * Browser used
  * Date and Time



The data are used in aggregate by system administrators and Web content managers to tune the Web site for its efficiency and is not ordinarily associated with specific individuals. Raw data from the Web server logs is only shared with the content manager of the Web site. Summary reports produced from the logs help Web publishers determine what Web browsers and pages are most popular. For example, if the aggregate reports show a particular Web page is very popular or used more by freshmen than by seniors, we use this information to customize the content of that page and make it easier to find.

### Cookies

Cookies are small pieces of data stored by the Web browser. Cookies are often used to remember information about preferences and pages you have visited. For example, when you visit some sites on the Web you might see a "Welcome Back" message. The first time you visited the site a cookie was probably set on your computer; when you return, the cookie is read again. You can refuse to accept cookies, can disable cookies, and remove cookies from your hard drive. In Netscape Navigator, choose Edit and Preferences to manage your cookie settings, in Internet Explorer select Tools and Internet Options.

It is against Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board policy to share cookie information with external third parties.

Certified independent security specialists audit these security measures and respective systems.

The Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board does not, unless upon explicit request of institutional users, share information with other parties or gather information from other private data providers. Unless specifically required under public information requests filed under the Texas Public Information Act, it is against Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board policy to release confidential information gathered through the Web, such as pages visited, or personalized preferences.
