##  Personal Privacy Policy

| **Personal information** |  We intend to give you as much control as possible over your personal information. In general, you can visit ApplicationStation.com on the Web without telling us who you are or revealing any information about yourself. There are times, however, when we may need information from you, such as your name and address. It is our intent to let you know before we collect personal information from you on the Internet. If you choose to give us personal information via the Internet that we or our business partners may need -- to correspond with you, process an order or provide you with a subscription, for example -- it is our intent to let you know how we will use such information. If you tell us that you do not wish to have this information used as a basis for further contact with you, we will respect your wishes. We do keep track of the domains from which people visit us. We analyze this data for trends and statistics, and then we discard it. We have implemented these practices for the ApplicationStation Home Page (www.applicationstation.com). Each area that may collect user information will contain a privacy statement tailored to what that portion of the site does and reflecting the practices outlined here.

**Information security  
and quality** |  We intend to protect the quality and integrity of your personally identifiable information. We have implemented appropriate technical and managerial procedures to maintain information that is accurate, current, and complete. We will make a sincere effort to respond to your requests to correct personal information inaccuracies in a timely manner.   
**Business relationships** |  The ApplicationStation site contains links to other Web sites. ApplicationStation is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites.   
**Cookies** |  There are various technologies, including one called "cookies", which can be used to provide you with tailored information from a Web site.
