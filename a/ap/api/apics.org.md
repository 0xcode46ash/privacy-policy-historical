APICS Online Privacy Policy

  
APICS respects the privacy of visitors to its Web site and has developed the following privacy policy to inform visitors about how information is handled once it has been submitted online. 

Personal, identifying information is not collected from visitors to our site unless this information has been voluntarily provided. All sensitive information sent to APICS is kept confidential. However, please be advised that the APICS Web site will query visitors browsers for certain information, such as   
* the domain you are registered with   
* the type of PC operating system you use   
* the type of browser you use. 

This information is used solely to measure and improve our Web site and services and to better serve our members and customers. No individual session data is saved; APICS only uses aggregate statistical data to compile reports. 

When you order from our online _Educational Materials Catalog_ , please be aware that  
the catalog uses "cookies" for temporary storage of individual items in your shopping cart during the ordering process; however, these "cookies" are deleted when you complete the order.

When you request information or items related to the APICS CPIM and CIRM certification programs, your contact information (name, address, and APICS identification number) is automatically transferred to the test administrator. This information is required to be on file with our vendor to enable APICS customers and members to register for our certification exams. Please note: Information transferred to APICS' test vendor is not used or distributed in any other manner. 

Persons placing orders or requests for free brochures from the APICS Web site will occasionally receive information from us about products, services, and educational offerings that relate to their area of interest. We try not to deluge you with junk mail.

Please note: If this is the first time you have contacted APICS online, it has been our practice to send one e-mail message to you at the end of the month with an invitation to join the What's New electronic mailing list, which provides updates and information about new developments at APICS and our Web site, [http://www.apics.org](http://www.apics.org/).
