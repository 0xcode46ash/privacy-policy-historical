1\. Collection of Information  
Information is collected within the Apigee in several ways. During the ordering process, Sonoa asks for information such as names, addresses, and account information. Once you have submitted this information, you will be registered into Apigee. You may also be asked for personal information when you add Users, report a problem with Apigee, or if you otherwise contact Sonoa. When your API is accessed through Apigee our servers automatically record information that developer programs send. These server logs may include information such as your web request, Internet Protocol address and the date and time of your request.  
Sonoa’s Apigee Privacy Policy applies solely to information collection practice on the Apigee website. This website may contain links to other sites. Please be aware that Sonoa has no control or influence over the privacy practices of such other sites. Sonoa encourages Apigee users to be aware when they leave the Apigee website and to read the Privacy Policy of each and every website that they visit.

2\. Use of Information  
Sonoa’s primary purpose for collecting and using personal information is to ensure the Apigee is tailored to your preferences. The information better equips Sonoa to provide you with services and products that you expect from Sonoa.  
Sonoa may also use information for marketing purposes. For example, Sonoa may use information you provide to contact you to further discuss your interest in Apigee and to send you information regarding Sonoa, such as information about promotions or events. 

3\. Choices Regarding Collection, Use and Distribution of Information  
If you indicated upon ordering that you are not interested in receiving offers or information from Sonoa, Sonoa will remove you from the distribution list. Only Sonoa will send you these emails.

Sonoa will not disclose any of your personally identifiable information except when we have your express permission or under special circumstances, such as when we believe in good faith that the law requires it. Sonoa may also disclose account information in special cases when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) Sonoa’s rights or property, other users of Apigee, or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities. Sonoa may disclose aggregated user statistics to others, but none of these statistics will contain personally identifiable information about our customers and their use of this site.
