**Fraud Protection**

AVADirect has designed its online store to give you options concerning the privacy of your credit card information, name, address, e-mail and any other information you provide us. AVADirect is committed to data security with respect to information collected on our site. In addition to the industry standard security measures available through your browser called SSL encryption, we have made a practice to call customers in the event of potential problem with your purchase. Also, you may always contact a sales representative over the telephone in case you don't want to provide your credit card information online at 1-866-766-4629. 

Help provect yourself - we strongly encourage you to use your billing address as a shipping destination to minimize risk of fraud, however unlikely a scenario it may seem. 

For protection of our Customers, we ship only to the verified billing address or authorized shipping address registered with the Customer's credit card issuer. Authorized shipping address can be obtained upon contact of the credit card issuer. Credit card issuer registers alternative (shipping) address upon customer's authorization in addition to existing billing address for internet deliveries. Please call 1-866-766-4629 if you have any questions. 

To register an alternative address (not the same as billing - for example your office or relative's place of residence), call the toll-free number on the back of your credit card for further assistance.
