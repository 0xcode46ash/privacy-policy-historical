Privacy Statement

Availity has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for the Availity web site.

The registration form and online surveys require customers to provide us with certain contact information, such as name and email address. We use this contact information to send customers information about our company and upcoming enhancements.

The Availity marketing web site and transaction gateway contains links to other sites. Availity is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such web sites.

Security 

Availity is committed to managing information transaction exchanges using state-of-the-art security systems and encryption technology which are designed so that data traveling through the Availity® Gateway is inaccessible to those who are not otherwise entitled to the information. Network and data security is fundamental to Availity. Our security and registration processes are designed to be compliant with evolving State and Federal regulations such as the [Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)](https://web.archive.org/web/20031203132611id_/http%3A//www.availity.com/hipaa_home.htm "HIPAA Information").

Part of the Availity value to the health care community is helping to establish accurate information exchange. Availity does provide some level of data validation by performing health plan-specific edits, in addition to those that participating health plans may evoke, to ensure the highest degree of accuracy and turn-around time as possible. These edits are not a manipulation of any medical, financial, or other data, and Availity does not otherwise manipulate the data values.

Availity provides a connection through which information passes and has no ownership interest in the data passing through our gateway. Our commitment to health care providers, health plans, and others is the secure movement of accurate health care information from one customer to another. The Availity Gateway allows providers, health plans, and other health care stakeholders to communicate without the need to fully convert their other applications or to cede any control of access to their databases or their database content.

A listing of [HIPAA-related links](https://web.archive.org/web/20031203132611id_/http%3A//www.availity.com/reference_hipaa.htm "HIPAA Reference Page") is available for more information.
