However, in order to conduct global business in this increasingly electronic economy, the collection of Personal Data is often necessary and desirable.

**The Collection of Personal Data**

In order to access and use certain Avaya websites or parts of websites, Avaya will request Personal Data from you, like your name, e-mail address, company name and telephone number ("Personal Data"). Avaya uses this information to customize your experience on our web site and provide you with a password to use these web sites, or for the purposes stated at the time of collection, such as participation in a promotion.

By registering on the Avaya web site, you will be deemed to have consented to the use, transfer, export and retention of your Personal Data as set out in this privacy statement. Consequently, after registering, Avaya may use this submitted information for other business purposes, such as alerting you to products and services that can assist you in your business, promoting site registration, and assisting in order processing. Avaya will maintain Personal Data in a secure environment through a secure connection/encryption to ensure confidentiality.
