| Privacy Policy  |   
| (Last Revised - 3/06/01) |   
| Thank you for visiting the Avanade Web site. This online privacy policy is designed to tell you about how we will collect and use information from our site so that you can make an informed choice about using this site. The primary purpose of Avanade is to develop and deliver Internet and technology solutions to help businesses improve profitability, deepen customer and supplier relationships, gain speed to market, and fuel growth. |   
| Please be advised that your use of this site constitutes your acceptance of the provisions of this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to these provisions, you should immediately terminate your access to and not use the Site. Avanade reserves the right to change the provisions of this privacy policy at any time but will alert you that changes have been made by indicating on the privacy policy the date it was last updated. Your use of the site following the posting of such changes or revised policy shall constitute your acceptance of any such changes. We encourage you to review our privacy policy whenever you visit our web site to make sure that you understand how your information will be used.  |   
| What information do we gather?  |   
| Information on Avanade is gathered in two ways: (1) passively (for example, through our site's technology), and (2) actively (for example, if you send us an e-mail request). |   
| When you visit our site, our software automatically collects some information from your computer. The information includes the unique Internet address assigned to your computer, your Internet service provider, your browser type and version, and your operating system. |   
| We also collect information when you voluntarily submit it to us. For example, if you ask for more information on Avanade's services, we may store and use the information you provide for marketing purposes. If you submit a technical question to us, we may store your question and we may contact you if we need clarification on the question. Also, we may post your question along with our answer on our site. However, we will not include your last name or email address if we post an answer to your question. |   
| Similarly, if you contact us through our site to inquire about employment opportunities with Avanade, we may collect and store the information you provide for recruiting purposes. If you are applying for a job in a country other than the United States, your application information may be shared with outside recruiting consultants. If you wish to inquire further about employment opportunities in the United States, you will be directed via a link on our site to an online recruiting site (the "Recruiting Site") managed by SHL USA, Inc ("SHL"), a consulting firm that is assisting us in our recruiting efforts. On the Recruiting site, you will be asked for information necessary for the recruiting process such as your name, contact information and technical experience. In addition, you will be asked to complete a screening exercise. SHL will compile the information you provide and send it back to Avanade. SHL will not use or share this information with anyone except Avanade. Please note that people under 18 years old are not authorized to submit recruiting information. |   
| How do we use the information we collect? |   
| We may collect the information you voluntarily submit to us and use it for the purposes for which it was submitted. We may also use the information that you voluntarily submit to us in the following ways: |   
| To provide you with information about Avanade; To request feedback and to enable us to develop and improve the features and content of the site and the services available from Avanade; To contact you regarding your use of the site; changes to the Terms of Use, Privacy Policy, or other policies; and our use of the information you submit; and to contact you regarding new site features, news about Avanade, events, marketing offers, products, services, and other opportunities. If we wish to use the information for other purposes, we will notify you prior to such use. If you object to any such use, you can e-mail us at [webmaster@avanade.com](mailto:webmaster@avanade.com) and let us know of your objection, and we will not use your information for such purpose. If you wish to have any personal information you have sent to us removed from our database, please e-mail us at [webmaster@avanade.com](mailto:webmaster@avanade.com). |

| We may analyze the information we collect passively and with cookies to determine what is most effective about our site, to help us identify ways to improve it and, eventually, to determine how we can make it more effective. |
