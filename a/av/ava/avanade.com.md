Thank you for visiting the Avanade website. This online privacy policy is designed to tell you about how we will collect and use information from our site so that you can make an informed choice about using this site. The primary purpose of Avanade is to develop and deliver Internet and technology solutions to help businesses improve profitability, deepen customer and supplier relationships, gain speed to market, and fuel growth.

Please be advised that your use of this site constitutes your acceptance of the provisions of this privacy policy. If you do not agree to these provisions, you should immediately terminate your access to and not use the site. Avanade reserves the right to change the provisions of this privacy policy at any time but will alert you that changes have been made by indicating on the privacy policy the date it was last updated. Your use of the site following the posting of such changes or revised policy shall constitute your acceptance of any such changes. We encourage you to review our privacy policy whenever you visit our website to make sure that you understand how your information will be used. 

Avanade Inc, is a company incorporated in State of Washington and controls this site from its U.S. offices, according to U.S. law.

 **What information do we gather?**

Information on Avanade is gathered in two ways: (1) passively (for example, through our site's technology), and (2) actively (for example, if you send us an e-mail request).

When you visit our site, our software automatically collects some information from your computer. The information includes the unique Internet address assigned to your computer, your Internet service provider, your browser type and version, and your operating system.

We also collect information when you voluntarily submit it to us. For example, if you ask for more information on the services that Avanade provides, we may store and use the information you provide for marketing purposes. If you submit a technical question to us, we may store your question and we may contact you if we need clarification on the question. Also, we may post your question along with our answer on our site. However, we will not include your last name or email address if we post an answer to your question.

Similarly, if you contact us through our site to inquire about employment opportunities with Avanade, we may collect and store the information you provide for recruiting purposes. On the recruiting site, you will be asked for information necessary for the recruiting process such as your name, contact information and technical experience. Because different jurisdictions have different privacy laws and Avanade is committed to complying with such laws, when applying for positions in some locations before you can submit your CV/Resume you will need to indicate your consent to the following uses of your CV/Resume by Avanade: (1) Avanade, its affiliates, and agents will store, access, and use the information in any jurisdiction, including jurisdictions whose privacy laws may be different and less protective than those of your home jurisdiction; and (2) Avanade, its affiliates and agents, may use this information to evaluate your eligibility for employment and to contact you for recruiting purposes. Please note that people under 18 years old are not authorized to submit recruiting information.

By providing us with unsolicited sensitive personal data, you consent to our using the data subject to applicable law as described in this privacy policy. The references to "sensitive personal data" are to the various categories of personal data identified by European and other data privacy laws as requiring special treatment, including in some circumstances the need to obtain explicit consent.
