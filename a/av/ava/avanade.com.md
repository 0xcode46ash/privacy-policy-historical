The primary purpose of Avanade is to develop and deliver Internet and technology solutions to help businesses improve profitability, deepen customer and supplier relationships, gain speed to market and fuel growth.

Please be advised that your use of this site constitutes your acceptance of the provisions of this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy, the Terms of Use or any other policy governing your access or use of our Site you should immediately terminate your access to and not use the Site. Avanade reserves the right to change the provisions of this privacy policy at any time but will alert you that changes have been made by indicating on the privacy policy the date it was last updated. Your use of the site following the posting of such changes or revised policy shall constitute your acceptance of any such changes. We encourage you to review our privacy policy whenever you visit our web site to make sure that you understand how your information will be used.

What information do we gather? Information on Avanade is gathered in two ways: (1) passively (for example, through our site's technology); and (2) actively (for example, if you send us an email request).

When you visit our site, our software automatically collects some information from your computer. The information includes the unique Internet address assigned to your computer, your Internet service provider, your browser type and version, and your operating system.

We also collect information when you voluntarily submit it to us. For example, if you ask for more information on Avanade's services, we may store and use the information you provide in our files for marketing purposes. Similarly, if you contact us through our site to inquire about employment opportunities with Avanade, we may collect and store the information you provide in our files for recruiting purposes. If you wish to inquire further about employment opportunities, you will be directed via a link on our site to an online recruiting site (the "Recruiting Site") managed by SHL USA, Inc ("SHL"), a consulting firm that is assisting us in our recruiting efforts. On the Recruiting site, you will be asked for information necessary for the recruiting process such as your name, contact information and technical experience. In addition, you will be asked to complete a screening exercise. SHL will compile the information you provide and send it back to Avanade. SHL will not use or share this information with anyone except Avanade. Please note people under 18 years old are not authorized to submit recruiting information.

How do we use the information we collect? We may collect the information you voluntarily submit to us and use it for the purposes for which it was submitted. We may also use the information that you voluntarily submit to us in the following ways: 

  * To provide you with information about Avanade; 
  * To request feed back and to enable us to develop and improve the features and content of the site and the services available from Avanade; 
  * To contact you regarding your use of the site, changes to the Terms of Use, Privacy Policy or other policies and our use of the information you submit; and 
  * To contact you regarding new site features, news about Avanade, events, marketing offers, products, services and other opportunities. 

If we wish to use the information for other purposes, we will notify you prior to such use. If you object to any such use, you can email us at [webmaster@avanade.com](mailto:webmaster@avanade.com) and let us know of your objection and we will not use your information for such purpose. If you wish to have any personal information you have sent to us removed from our data base, please email us at [webmaster@avanade.com](mailto:webmaster@avanade.com).

The cookies we use identify you merely as a number and they are destroyed when you leave our site. (If you are uncomfortable regarding cookies use, please keep in mind you can disable cookies on your computer by changing the settings in the preferences or options menu in your browser.
