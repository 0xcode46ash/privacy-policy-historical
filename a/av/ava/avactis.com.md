Pentasoft Corporation ("Pentasoft") respects your privacy. We describe our privacy practices in this Privacy Policy so that you understand what Personal Information we collect about you and your company, and how we use such information.

"Personal Information" as used in the Privacy Policy refers to any information that identifies or can be used to identify, contact, or locate the person to whom such information pertains. This includes information that is linked with personally identifiable information from other sources, or from which other personally identifiable information can easily be derived.

When you register on our Web Site, we will ask you for certain Personal Information such as, for example, your name, company name, address, telephone number, and e-mail address. We may also ask you to complete a questionnaire about your company and provide information such as type of company, size of company, and information related to your potential interest in Pentasoft and our products.

If you send Pentasoft correspondence through e-mail, in the course of technical support, or through any other means, or if other users or third parties such as businesses send us information about your activities in connection with your use of our Web Site, Pentasoft may retain that information subject to this Privacy Policy.

You are always free to decline cookies if your web browser has this functionality, although if you do so, you may not be able to use certain features on our Web Site which are dependent on the information those cookies collect, and you may be required to reenter certain information more frequently during a session.

Pentasoft collects this information, and may use the services of a third party web site host who operates, manages and maintains our Web Site. Any such web site host acts solely as an agent of Pentasoft in the collection of such information and is required to comply with this Privacy Policy.

Use of this information helps us to better understand and immediately respond to your particular interests while you navigate our site. This information as well as demographic information derived from your registration and others may be aggregated and shared with associates and third parties, but only in aggregated form that does not contain any Personal Information.

In addition, Pentasoft uses information maintained about you, and other information obtained from your current and past activities to resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems and, if necessary, to enforce our rights. At times, Pentasoft may review the information of multiple users to identify problems or to resolve disputes.

You may at any time choose to disclose or not disclose the Personal Information we request; however, if you choose not to disclose the requested information, we may not be able to provide you with some or all of the products, information or services you request.

Our Web Site employs a number of current technology security measures to protect the security of Personal Information. We have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and help prevent unauthorized access, maintain data security, and correctly use the information we collect online. All Personal Information is stored in password protected storage facilities, accessible only to authorized personnel.

This Privacy Policy only applies to information collected by Pentasoft. Any information you provide to, or that is collected by, third-party sites may be subject to the privacy policies of those sites, if any. We encourage you to read such privacy policies of any third-party sites you visit. It is the sole responsibility of such third parties to adhere to any applicable restrictions on the disclosure of your Personal Information, and Pentasoft and affiliates shall not be liable for wrongful use or disclosure of your Personal Information by any third party.

You should also be aware that if you submit information to "chat rooms", "forums" or "message boards" such information becomes public information, meaning that you lose any privacy rights you might have in that information. Such disclosures may also increase your chances of receiving unwanted communications.

Pentasoft reserves the right to change this Privacy Policy at any time by posting a new Privacy Policy on our Web Site. However, if we change our Privacy Policy to permit a new use or disclosure of Personal Information, we will not so use or disclose your Personal Information collected prior to posting of the new policy unless we first notify you via e-mail of the new policy and provide you with an opportunity to opt out of the new use or disclosure provisions.

You may at any time print or download a copy of this Privacy Policy. If you believe that this policy has been violated, please contact by e-mail to  [](mailto:legal%40avactis.com) . Our response to such inquiries may be limited to information under our direct control.
