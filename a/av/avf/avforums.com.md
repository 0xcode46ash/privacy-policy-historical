# Privacy Policy

**Terms of Use  
**  
AVForums.com is owned and operated by M2N Limited.   
Please read this notice before using our site. By using the site, you agree to abide by these Terms of Use; please do not use our site if you do not agree with the Terms of Use outlined below. M2N Limited reserves the right to modify the Terms of Use at its sole discretion, and by using this site, you agree to be bound by the modifications or updates to the Terms of Use.

 **Privacy Notice  
**  
M2N Limited values your privacy. To keep you informed, we have created this privacy statement that discloses our purposes and methods for online collection and use of information. This statement applies to all information collected through the M2N Limited websites and information gathered from any web pages that we host.

**Types of Information Collected  
**  
Generally, personal information is not collected from visitors to the M2N Limited websites. However, in order to access certain special services, personal information is requested; those cases are described in more detail below.

**Forum Registration  
**  
M2N Limited requires a valid e-mail address for users who want to register with the AVForums.com. This allows us to protect our community from abusive postings and provides a verifiable point of contact should legal questions arise. At any time, you have the ability to keep your e-mail address hidden from other users by selecting that option within your user profile.

Also in the forum registration, you have the option of providing some additional information such as occupation, interests, and homepage URL. This information is made available to other forum users to foster a sense of community. If you have any concerns about providing this information, simply leave the fields blank and your registration will still be processed.

**Cookies  
**  
Certain activities on AVForums website involve the use of "cookies" to facilitate your experience. This includes the ability to automatically log you into the forums and show you the new topics since your last visit. You have the option to turn these cookies off at any time by updating your user profile preferences. If your browser doesn't support cookies, or if you have cookies turned off, these preferences will not be set.  
We also use a cookie which collects anonymous traffic data about how people use AVForums. This information helps us to improve the website and does not affect anyone's browsing experience or their privacy.

**Disclosure of Personal Information  
**  
M2N Limited/AVForums.com does not disclose your personally identifying information to any third parties for any purpose without your prior consent unless required by law to do so. All reasonable care is taken by staff handling personal information to ensure its security both offline and online. It is our policy to destroy server access and personal information provided during the technical support process upon completion of the technical support incident.

It's also important to be aware that when you voluntarily provide personal information (e.g., last name, address, phone number) in a posting on the forum, that information is publicly available and may be used by someone in a manner unintended by you. For that reason, we discourage the offering of any personally identifying information within the message board itself.

**Privacy for Children  
**  
Although the M2N Limited websites are generally targeted at an adult audience, we welcome the participation of younger users with their parents' consent. We strongly recommend that users under 18 years of age refrain from offering any personal information either in their user profile or in the forums themselves, and we encourage parents to stay involved in the online life of their children.

M2N Limited complies fully with the UK data protection act. The personal data we store about AVForums members (limited to their email address and date of birth in most cases) is used only for internal purposes and therefore we are not obliged to notify the Information Commissioner's Office.

**Changing or Updating Personal Information

 **Your online shopping can support AVForums.**

AVForums members often post links to products on merchants’ websites. eBay and Amazon are common examples.  
AVForums.com uses Skimlinks.com technology to convert these links into ones which generate revenue for AVForums.com.  
When a link is clicked, a Skimlinks script automatically analyses it, and if the link takes the user to an affiliated merchant’s website, the AVForums affiliate ID is tagged on the end of the link. The link is then followed to the merchant’s website.  
This does not change which web page is being visited, and the intention is that the process will be completely invisible to the user.  
After arriving at the product page on the affiliated merchant’s website, if the user then makes a purchase, a small proportion of that revenue is designated to AVForums in a standard ‘revenue share’.   
We use this revenue as part of our income to maintain and grow AVForums.  
So you can support AVForums by posting links to interesting products and bargains you find.
