# Avon UK Security Statement

**Privacy and security statement** | ****  
---|---  
   
At Avon, we respect the privacy of every individual who visits our website, communicates with us or purchases Avon products online. The information you give to us is used to process your orders and to provide you with an efficient and personal shopping experience. 

This statement outlines the information Avon will collect from the website and how we will use that information. This statement also lets you know what to do if you want us to remove personal information about you collected or stored during previous visits to the website.   
  
  
   
**How we collect and use personal information**  
****  
We follow strict security procedures in the collection, storage and disclosure of the information you have given us to prevent unauthorised access and misuse, as required by the UK Data Protection Acts of 1984 and 1998. 

We do not collect any personally identifying information from you unless you expressly consent to the terms and conditions of this statement when you register on the website or purchase our products from the website. Upon receiving your express consent, we only collect such personally identifying information that we specifically need - for example, to send you a brochure, to put you in contact with a local independent sales representative, to fulfil an order or to provide account details. 

If you do not want us to collect any personally identifiable information from you, please do not provide us with any such information. We gather non-specific information on the numbers of visitors to certain areas of our website without asking for your consent to do so. We monitor website usage in this manner to help us continually improve the design and layout of our website. 

If you do provide us with personal information, we may retain and use that information for the following purposes:   
\- We may store and process the information to better understand your needs and how we can improve our products and services.   
\- We may retain information for invoicing and delivery purposes after you make a purchase of our products.   
\- We may retain information about your previous purchases in order to customise our website services for your future visits to the website. 

In addition, we may use your e-mail address to send you information about new products or special offers which we think may be of interest to you, to advise you of important changes to the website or for other marketing purposes. You will be asked if you wish to be take part in this by clicking on the 'opt in’ box provided. 

We may also disclose any information, including personally identifiable information, we deem necessary, in our sole discretion, to comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request. 

Wherever you provide personal information about yourself, you will see the 'information padlock' symbol. This is an official symbol of the Data Protection Commissioner/National Consumer Council, and it is there to alert you to the fact that your personal information is being collected. (You can click on the symbol at any time to return to this page for more information.) 

All of your personal information will be stored securely for the duration of your relationship with us and for 2 years thereafter. 

Personal information provided to us on our website may be transmitted over the Internet. Transfers of personal information may therefore take place, potentially, to any country in the world.   
  
   
**Sharing of information with other divisions of our company**  
****  
We may share your personally identifiable information, either for processing or storage, with other divisions of our company located inside and outside the European Economic Area (“EEA”). Although countries where some of our divisions are located, including the United States, may not offer the same level of legal protection of data as countries within the EEA, other divisions of our company adhere to data protection policies that we believe provide a safe, confidential and secure environment for your personal information.   
   
**Sharing of information with other third parties**  
****  
To fulfil your requirements, we may also need to give essential personal details to third parties other than our affiliates, such as our delivery agents. We only share such essential personal information with third parties located in the EEA and subject to its stringent data privacy laws. Avon assumes no responsibility or liability whatsoever for the practices, actions or policies of these third parties.  
   
**How we protect your information**  
****  
We are aware that you may be concerned about the privacy and confidentiality of your personal information, including credit card and delivery address information. Therefore, we have taken precautions to ensure that this information is safe and secure. If you are registered with us, your online account information is protected by a password chosen by you. Access to your online account requires your username and password and we recommend that you do not disclose this information to any other person.   
Additionally, we protect your personal data using a technology called Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). Your personal information is then automatically encrypted before being sent over the Internet. (You should note that the device you use to connect to the internet must be equipped with Microsoft Internet Explorer 4 (or later) or Netscape Navigator 4 (or later) in order to use this technology.). Our divisions have taken similar precautions to ensure that any processing or storing of your personal information is safe and secure. 

All your data will then be stored securely for the duration of your relationship with us and for 2 years thereafter.
