**TABLE OF CONTENTS**

INTRODUCTION; SCOPE   
Avon Products, Inc. ("Avon," "us," or "we") has created this Privacy Statement to inform you about how we collect, use and disclose information.  
This Privacy Statement applies to information collected through this website and any Avon mobile sites, applications, widgets, and other interactive features that link to this Privacy Statement (the "Site"). Except as specifically provided below, this Privacy Statement does not apply to information collected by Avon by or through any other means, such as information collected offline.  
PERSONAL INFORMATION   
**Collection of Personal Information.** " **Personal Information** " is information that can identify you such as name, postal address (including billing and shipping addresses), telephone number, e-mail address, credit card number, and user name. We collect Personal Information from you when provide information directly to us, including when you register with us or otherwise interact with us on the Site.  
**Use of Personal Information.** We may use Personal Information:

  * for the purposes for which you specifically provided it including, without limitation, to enable us to respond to your inquiries and process and fulfill your requests;
  * to send you information about your relationship or transactions with us;
  * to tell you about our company’s operations, services, and programs;
  * to personalize your experience with us;
  * to allow you to use, communicate and interact with others on our Site; and 


  * for our internal business purposes, such as data analysis, audits,  enhancing our website, improving our services and identifying usage trends. 



**Sharing Personal Information.** We may disclose your Personal Information:

  * to companies that are affiliated with us, that is, are part of the Avon family of companies, ([click here](http://www.youravon.com/REPSuite/SEC_entity.page) to see a list), but not for their direct marketing purposes;
  * to third-party service providers who provide services to Avon, such as website hosting, data analysis, payment processing, order fulfillment, infrastructure provision, information technology services, customer service, e-mail delivery services, credit card processing, auditing, training, and other similar services. (These third parties will be supplied with, or have access to, your Personal Information for the purpose of providing these services to us or on our behalf);
  * to a third party in the event of any reorganization, merger, sale, joint venture, assignment, transfer or other disposition of all or any portion of our business, assets or stock (including in connection with any bankruptcy or similar proceedings); and

NON-PERSONAL INFORMATION 

**Collection of Non-Personal Information.** **"Non-Personal Information"** is any information that does not reveal your specific identity, such as:

  * Browser information
  * Information collected through cookies, pixel tags and other technologies
  * Demographic information and other information provided by you
  * Aggregated information



We and our third-party service providers may collect Non-Personal Information in a variety of ways. For example, we

  * collect information such as your computer type (Windows or Macintosh), screen resolution, operating system version and Internet browser type and version.
  * collect demographic information, such as your location, education, profession, age, gender, as well as other information, such as special interests when you voluntarily provide this information to us. Unless combined with Personal Information, this information does not personally identify you or anyone else.



**Aggregating information.** We may aggregate Personal Information so that the aggregated information does not personally identify you or anyone else. In some instances, we may combine Non-Personal Information with Personal Information (such as combining your name with your geographical location). If we combine any Non-Personal Information with Personal Information, the combined information will be treated by us as Personal Information as long as it is combined.  
**Use and Sharing of Non-Personal Information.** Because Non-Personal Information does not personally identify you, we may collect, use and disclose Non-Personal Information for any purpose.

COOKIES AND OTHER TECHNOLOGIES   
**Cookies:** We and our third-party service providers may use "cookies" on the Site. Cookies allow a web server to transfer data to a computer for recordkeeping and other purposes. We use cookies and other technologies to, among other things, better serve you with more tailored information and facilitate your ongoing access to and use of the Site. We also allow vendors to use cookies on our website. If you do not want information collected through the use of cookies, there is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows you to decline the use of cookies. To learn more about cookies, please visit the following site, which is not affiliated with Avon: <http://www.allaboutcookies.org/>.  
**Local Storage Objects:** We and our third-party service providers may use Flash Local Storage Objects ("Flash LSOs") in certain situations including to recognize you and remember what is in your shopping cart. Flash LSOs are different from browser cookies because of the amount and type of data stored. In addition, you generally cannot control, delete or disable the acceptance of Flash LSOs from your browser. For more information on Flash LSOs, and to learn how to control them, click on the support Page for the Flash Player and choose [Global Storage Settings Panel](http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager03.html) and follow the instructions. To see the Flash LSOs on your computer now, go to the [Website Storage Settings Panel](http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html) and follow the instructions to review and, if you choose, to delete any specific Flash LSO.  
**Pixel tags and other technologies:** Clear GIFs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies. However, in contrast to cookies, which are stored on your computer's hard drive, clear GIFs are embedded invisibly on website pages. We may use clear GIFs (also known as web beacons, web bugs or pixel tags) in connection with the Site to, among other things, track the activities of our Site visitors and compile statistics about Site usage and response rates. We and our third-party service providers also may use clear GIFs in HTML-formatted e-mail messages to help us track e-mail response rates, measure the success of our marketing campaigns, and identify when our e-mails are viewed or forwarded.  
**Site Analytics:** Avon may work with third-party service providers who use the technologies described in this section to conduct website analytics to help us track and understand how visitors use our Site. For example, we use Omniture, a third-party web analytics service provider, to help us improve our website performance and user experience. For more information and to review Omniture's privacy policy for Omniture Technology and its opt-out tool, please see their [privacy center](http://www.omniture.com/en/privacy/2o7#optout).  
**Widgets, Applications and similar technologies.** If you choose to utilize technology provided by us (such as a widget), any Personal Information or other information you make available through such technology may become available publicly, for example, through social media and other websites and platforms on which you may make the applicable technology available. In addition, some technology may have the capability to be distributed "virally" in other locations (for example, a friend may post the widget that contains your information to his or her blog). Avon is not responsible or liable for the collection, use or disclosure of Personal Information and/or other information that is made publicly available.
