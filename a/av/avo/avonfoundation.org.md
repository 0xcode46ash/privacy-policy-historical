# Privacy Statement | Avon Foundation

Last Updated: June 12, 2017

**Introduction**

Avon Foundation for Women, a 501(c)(3) not for profit organization having a place of business at 601 Midland Avenue, Rye, NY 10580 (referred to herein as “ **Avon Foundation** ,” “ **we** ,” “ **us** ” and “ **our** “), understands the importance of the privacy of individuals who interact with us (such individuals are referred to as “ **users** ” and “ **you,** ” “your” etc.). This Privacy Statement (the “ **Statement** “), which is incorporated into our Terms and Conditions of Use below (“Agreement”), describes the handling of personal information that the Avon Foundation collects through AVONFOUNDATION.ORG and other websites owned by the Avon Foundation (collectively, the “Avon Foundation Websites”) as well as personal information about you that is collected off-line for example, by telephone or postal mail.   This Statement also describes how we use and disclose that information. By providing us with your information, and/or using the Avon Foundation Websites, you agree to this Statement.

We reserve the right to change this Statement, in whole or in part, from time to time at our sole discretion, and to provide you notice of the change by any reasonable means, including without limitation posting the revised draft of this Statement and notice of the changes on the Avon Foundation Websites. You can determine when this Statement was last revised by referring to the “Last Updated” legend at the top of this Statement. Your continued use of the Avon Foundation Websites following the posting of changes to this Statement constitutes your acceptance of those changes.

**THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT**

We collect two basic types of information through the Avon Foundation Websites: your personal information and non-personally identifiable information. “ **Your Personal Information** ” is information that identifies you as an individual — for example, your name, address, telephone number, email address, race and ethnicity, credit card information, and billing address and shipping information.  “ **Non-Personally Identifiable Information** ” (or “ **Non-PII** “) is aggregated information, demographic information, IP addresses and any other information that does not reveal your specific identity. We also collect Your Personal Information that you disclose to us by off-line communications.

  * **Your Personal Information.**   You do not have to provide Your Personal Information to access the Avon Foundation Website. However, in order for you to take advantage of particular opportunities provided through the Avon Foundation Websites (for example, to sign up to receive Avon Foundation email newsletters, or to make a donation through the Avon Foundation Website), we may require that you furnish us with Your Personal Information through the Avon Foundation Websites. Information you provide when you register for Avon events, newsletters, or other services are collected directly by our third-party Service Provider and provided to us, except we do not receive any credit card or financial account numbers you provide.
  * We also collect PII, such as your name, telephone number and street address, when you contact us by off-line methods, such as postal mail or telephone.
  * **Non-Personally Identifiable Information (“Non-PII”).**   When you visit and interact with the Avon Foundation Websites, we and our third party service providers who provide services, including without limitation website hosting, data analysis, and other services of an administrative nature (those third party service providers, our “ **Service Providers** “) may collect Non-PII (for example, a list of the Avon Foundation Website pages you visit). Non-PII is generally collected from server log files, cookies, and pixel tags. Our Service Providers are those third parties who collect information at our direction through the Avon Foundation Websites and do not include Third Party Sites/Services, described in the “ **Operators of Third Party Sites and Services** ” section of this Statement.


  * **Server Log Files.**  Your Internet Protocol (“ **IP** ”) address is an identifying number that is automatically assigned to your computer by your Internet Service Provider. This number is identified and logged automatically in our and/or our Service Providers’ server log files whenever you visit the Avon Foundation Websites, along with the time of your visit and the pages that you access. We use this information, in aggregated form, to calculate usage levels on the Avon Foundation Websites, to help diagnose problems with the Avon Foundation Websites’ servers, and to improve the user experience on the Avon Foundation Websites.
  * **Cookies.**  To enhance your experience with the Avon Foundation Websites, the Avon Foundation Websites use “cookies.” Cookies are text files we place in your computer’s browser to store your preferences. We also use cookies and other technologies to, among other things, better serve you with more tailored information and facilitate your ongoing access to and use of the Avon Foundation Websites. For example, we and our Service Providers may use cookies to personalize your experience on the Avon Foundation Websites (e.g., to recognize you by name when you return to an Avon Foundation Website), and to make the login process easier for password-protected areas of the Avon Foundation Websites. If you do not want information collected through the use of cookies, there is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows you to disable the use of cookies. To learn more about cookies, please visit the following site, which is not affiliated with Avon: [**http://www.allaboutcookies.org/**](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/). However, if you disable cookies you may not be able to take full advantage of some features of the Avon Foundation Websites.
  * **Pixel Tags and Other Technologies.**   ** ** We and our Service Providers may use clear GIFs (also known as web beacons, web bugs or pixel tags) in connection with the Site to, among other things, track the activities of our Site visitors and compile statistics about Site usage and response rates. We and our third-party Service Providers also may use clear GIFs in HTML-formatted e-mail messages to help us track e-mail response rates, measure the success of our marketing campaigns, and identify when our e-mails are viewed or forwarded. Clear GIFs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies. However, in contrast to cookies, which are stored on your computer’s hard drive, clear GIFs are embedded invisibly on website pages.


  * **Use of Anonymized Email Addresses.   **We use your e-mail addresses to exclude you from advertising campaigns on social media. We do this to improve efficiency, by not serving ads to people who are already registered. We use an anonymized version of your email address to do this. We do not share your specific email address with social media sites,



**HOW DO WE USE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?**    We may use Your Personal Information in the following ways and for the following purposes:

**HOW WE USE AND DISCLOSE THE NON-PII WE COLLECT.   **Because Non-PII does not personally identify you, we may use Non-PII, and disclose Non-PII to third parties, for any purpose.

**OPERATORS OF THIRD PARTY SITES AND SERVICES.**  NOTE THAT THIS STATEMENT DOES NOT ADDRESS THE PRIVACY PRACTICES OR POLICIES OF THIRD PARTIES.  The Avon Foundation Websites may contain links to websites operated by third parties, or may embed services operated by third parties (“ **Third Party Sites/Services** “), and those third parties may have privacy practices that are different from ours. Third Party Sites/Services that are embedded in the Avon Foundation Websites are identified as such. If you provide information through any Third Party Site/Service, that information will be collected by, and may be used and disclosed by those third parties, in accordance with the privacy practices and policies of those third parties. Avon Foundation Website users should consult those third parties’ privacy policies when using Third Party Sites/Services, as we have no control over the use or disclosure of information by third parties.

**SECURITY**

We have put in place reasonable physical, electronic and managerial procedures, including encryption technology where appropriate for on-line activities, to help us safeguard against unauthorized access to Your Personal Information and to help maintain data security. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or data storage solution will be 100% secure. As a result, although we take steps to protect Your Personal Information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to or receive from us or that we store on our or our Service Providers’ systems or with our Service Providers.
