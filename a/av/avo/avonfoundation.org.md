## Privacy Statement

Last Updated: Nov. 1, 2015

**Introduction**

Avon Foundation for Women, a 501(c)(3) not for profit organization having a place of business at 777 Third Avenue, New York, New York 10017 (referred to herein as " **Avon Foundation** ," " **we** ," " **us** " and " **our** "), understands the importance of the privacy of individuals who visit and interact with our websites (referred to as " **users** " and " **you** "). This Privacy Statement (the " **Statement** "), which is incorporated into our Terms and Conditions of Use below (“Agreement”), describes the information the Avon Foundation collects through AVONFOUNDATION.ORG and other websites sponsored by the Avon Foundation (collectively, the "Avon Foundation Websites"), and how we use and disclose that information. This Statement represents the sole authorized statement of the Avon Foundation's practices with respect to the collection of information through the Avon Foundation Websites and the Avon Foundation's use of that information. By using the Avon Foundation Websites, you agree to this Statement. If you do not agree to this Statement, you may not use the Avon Foundation Websites.

This Statement applies solely to Avon Foundation's collection of information through the Avon Foundation Websites and the Avon Foundation's use and disclosure of that information. This Statement does not apply to any of the following: (a) the Avon Foundation's collection of information through any website other than the Avon Foundation Websites, or the use or disclosure of any information so collected; (b) the Avon Foundation's collection of information offline, for example, by telephone or direct mail, or the use or disclosure of any information so collected; or (c) the collection, use or disclosure of information by any third party (even those affiliated with us). We reserve the right to change this Statement, in whole or in part, from time to time at our sole discretion, and to provide you notice of the change by any reasonable means, including without limitation posting the revised draft of this Statement and notice of the changes on the Avon Foundation Websites. You can determine when this Statement was last revised by referring to the "Last Updated" legend at the top of this Statement. Your continued use of the Avon Foundation Websites following the posting of changes to this Statement constitutes your acceptance of those changes.

**THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT**

We collect two basic types of information through the Avon Foundation Websites: your personal information and non-personally identifiable information. " **Your Personal Information** " is information that identifies you as an individual — for example, your name, address, telephone number, email address, race and ethnicity, credit card information, and billing address and shipping information.  " **Non-Personally Identifiable Information** " (or " **Non-PII** ") is aggregated information, demographic information, IP addresses and any other information that does not reveal your specific identity.

  * **Your Personal Information.**   
You do not have to provide Your Personal Information to access the Avon Foundation Website. However, in order for you to take advantage of particular opportunities provided through the Avon Foundation Websites (for example, to sign up to receive Avon Foundation email newsletters, or to make a donation through the Avon Foundation Website), we may require that you furnish us with Your Personal Information through the Avon Foundation Websites. Information you provide when you register for Avon events, newsletters, or other services are collected directly by our third-party Service Provider and provided to us, except we do not receive any credit card or financial account numbers you provide.
  * **  Non-Personally Identifiable Information (“Non-PII”).**   
When you visit and interact with the Avon Foundation Websites, we and our third party service providers who provide services, including without limitation website hosting, data analysis, and other services of an administrative nature (those third party service providers, our " **Service Providers** ") may collect Non-PII (for example, a list of the Avon Foundation Website pages you visit). Non-PII is generally collected from server log files, cookies, and pixel tags. Our Service Providers are those third parties who collect information at our direction through the Avon Foundation Websites and do not include Third Party Sites/Services, described in the “ **Operators of Third Party Sites and Services** ” section of this Statement.


  * **Server Log Files.** Your Internet Protocol (“ **IP** ”) address is an identifying number that is automatically assigned to your computer by your Internet Service Provider. This number is identified and logged automatically in our and/or our Service Providers' server log files whenever you visit the Avon Foundation Websites, along with the time of your visit and the pages that you access. We use this information, in aggregated form, to calculate usage levels on the Avon Foundation Websites, to help diagnose problems with the Avon Foundation Websites' servers, and to improve the user experience on the Avon Foundation Websites.
  * **Cookies.** To enhance your experience with the Avon Foundation Websites, the Avon Foundation Websites use "cookies." Cookies are text files we place in your computer's browser to store your preferences. We also use cookies and other technologies to, among other things, better serve you with more tailored information and facilitate your ongoing access to and use of the Avon Foundation Websites. For example, we and our Service Providers may use cookies to personalize your experience on the Avon Foundation Websites (e.g., to recognize you by name when you return to an Avon Foundation Website), and to make the login process easier for password-protected areas of the Avon Foundation Websites. If you do not want information collected through the use of cookies, there is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows you to disable the use of cookies. To learn more about cookies, please visit the following site, which is not affiliated with Avon: <http://www.allaboutcookies.org/>. However, if you disable cookies you may not be able to take full advantage of some features of the Avon Foundation Websites.
  * **Pixel Tags and Other Technologies.** ** ** We and our Service Providers may use clear GIFs (also known as web beacons, web bugs or pixel tags) in connection with the Site to, among other things, track the activities of our Site visitors and compile statistics about Site usage and response rates. We and our third-party Service Providers also may use clear GIFs in HTML-formatted e-mail messages to help us track e-mail response rates, measure the success of our marketing campaigns, and identify when our e-mails are viewed or forwarded. Clear GIFs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies. However, in contrast to cookies, which are stored on your computer's hard drive, clear GIFs are embedded invisibly on website pages. 


  * **Use of Anonymized Email Addresses.   **We use your e-mail addresses to exclude you from advertising campaigns on social media. We do this to improve efficiency, by not serving ads to people who are already registered. We use an anonymized version of your email address to do this. We do not share your specific email address with social media sites, 



**HOW DO WE USE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?**    We may use Your Personal Information in the following ways and for the following purposes: 

  * **Responding to Your Inquiries and Fulfilling Your Requests.** We may use Your Personal Information to respond to your inquiries to the Avon Foundation and to fulfill your requests — for example, to send you newsletters that you request when you sign up to join our mailing lists, to send you updates about the Avon Foundation news and events.

  * **    Combining Your Data**.  We may combine Your Personal Information with information collected from other users so that the end-product does not personally identify you or any other user of the Avon Foundation Websites, for example, by using Your Personal Information to calculate the percentage of our users who have a particular zip code or telephone area code. **Sending Administrative Emails**. From time to time, at our sole discretion, we may use Your Personal Information to send you emails (a) to confirm your registration with the Avon Foundation Websites, (b) to confirm a transaction through the Avon Foundation Websites, (c) to inform you that we have received Your Personal Information, (d) to provide you with information regarding the Avon Foundation Websites, or (e) to inform you of changes to this Statement, the Agreement, or our other terms, conditions, or policies. Because this information may be critical to your use of the Avon Foundation Websites, you may not opt out of receiving these emails.
  * **Analyzing Your Personal Information.   **The Foundation may work with third-party Service Providers who conduct website analytics to help us track and understand how visitors use Avon Foundation Websites. For example, we use Google Analytics, a third-party web analytics Service Provider, to help us improve our website performance and user experience.

We reserve the right to share Your Personal Information with affiliated and third party sponsors of those Promotions ("Sponsors"), or otherwise in accordance with the rules applicable to the Promotion.
