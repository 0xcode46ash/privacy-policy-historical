# Your Security & Privacy

**security and privacy statement **

Avon Products, Inc. (referred to as "AVON", "we", "us" and "our") respects the privacy of every individual who visits our Websites and online areas, participates in interactive bulletin boards or forums, or purchases AVON products on-line. This statement outlines the information AVON will collect and how we will use that information. This Security and Privacy Statement will apply to your use of AVON.COM, YOURAVON.COM, or any other Website owned or operated by AVON ("AVON WEBSITES"). This policy statement will also instruct you on what to do if you want AVON to remove your personal information collected or stored during previous visits to the AVON WEBSITES. 

**privacy policy**

AVON will not collect or retain any information about you personally (that is, your name, address, telephone number, or e-mail address) unless you provide it to us voluntarily. We will collect information from the AVON WEBSITES in several ways. If you register for an online account, we will ask you for personal information including your name, zip code, e-mail address and phone number. This personal information will be stored in your personal profile. Once you have submitted this information and chosen both a valid username and password, you will be able to take full advantage of using the AVON WEBSITES. When you make a purchase from the AVON WEBSITES, we will also ask for your credit card information, as well as, billing and shipping information. We will send out confirming e-mails whenever you register or make a purchase, to inform you that we received your personal information or to confirm your purchase.   
If you do provide us with personal information, we may retain and use that information for several purposes. First, we may store and process the information to better understand your needs and how we can improve our products and services. Second, we may retain information about your previous purchases of AVON products in order to customize our Website services for your future visits to the site. Third, we may use your e-mail address to send you updates about new products, specials and other items of interest. If you have already submitted this information and would like to remove it, you can delete this information from your personal profile. However, if you made a purchase, we will need to retain certain information for billing and shipping purposes.   
  
** sharing of information with third parties **

When you place an order through an eRepresentative, your order may be personally processed by the eRepresentative receiving credit for your order, and not by AVON. In these cases, all personal information required to process your order will be shared with your personal eRepresentative. Except as stated above or when necessary to share your information with AVON's agents or contractors for the purposes of performing services for AVON, your personal information (name, address, telephone number, e-mail address or other information) will not be provided to any third party without your prior consent. We have restricted our agents and contractors from using your personal information in any way other than to provide the services contracted for by AVON. 

**children**

AVON does not intend to collect any personal information (such as, name, address, telephone number, age or e-mail address) from persons under thirteen years of age. If a parent or guardian of a child who has provided us with such information would like the information deleted from our records, he or she should contact us at the e-mail address or phone number listed at the bottom of this policy statement. We will make commercially reasonable efforts to delete the child's information from our existing files. 

**cookies**

When you view one of the AVON WEBSITES, we may store some information in the form of a "cookie" or similar file that is automatically downloaded to your computer. Cookies enable us, among other things, to tailor a Website or advertisement to better match your interests and preferences. Please be assured that cookies are safe. They are not programs that can be used to damage files, and personal information cannot be gathered from them. If you do not want cookies sent to or stored on your system, most Internet Browsers will allow you to erase cookies from your computer hard drive, prevent them from being stored or trigger a warning before a cookie is stored. Please refer to your Browser instructions or help screen to learn more about these functions. 

**correcting your personal information**

If you registered with us, you will be able to view and change or modify any information contained in your personal profile by using the editing tools contained in the profile section of the AVON WEBSITES. 

**links to other sites**

We cannot ensure the protection of any personal information that you provide to a third-party site that links to or from the AVON WEBSITES, since these third-party sites are owned and operated independently. These third-party sites may have their separate privacy and data collection practices that are beyond our control. Any personal information that you provide to these third-party sites will be regulated by their privacy policy, if any. AVON can assume no responsibility or liability whatsoever for the practices, actions or policies of these third-party sites, and cannot be responsible for the content or privacy practices of such sites. 

**security precautions**

We are aware that you may be concerned about the privacy and confidentiality of your personal information, including, in the case of a purchase of goods, credit card and billing address information. Therefore, we have taken precautions to ensure that this information is safe and secure. If you registered with us, your online account information is protected by a password chosen by you. Access to that online account requires your username and password. We recommend that you do not disclose your username and password to any other person. Additionally, concerning credit card information, we protect your transactions using a technology called Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). If your browser is capable of SSL, and most are, your sensitive information will automatically be encrypted before being sent over the Internet. You should also know that we do not store your credit card or ordering information on our Internet server.   
No data transmission over the Internet will be 100% secure. While we take steps to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you transmit to us and you do so at your own risk. Upon receiving your transmission, we make commercially reasonable efforts to ensure its security on our systems. However, you are ultimately responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your username, passwords and/or any account information.

**acceptance of these terms**

By using this Website, you agree to this Security and Privacy Statement. If you do not agree to this policy, please do not use the AVON WEBSITES. AVON reserves the right to change this policy at any time. Your continued use of the AVON WEBSITES following the posting of changes to our Privacy Policy will signify your acceptance of those changes.
