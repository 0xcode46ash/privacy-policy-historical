### Avon Website Privacy Policies

### I. General

Avon Products, Inc. ("Avon") respects the privacy of every individual who visits our websites and online areas, participates in interactive bulletin boards or forums, or purchases Avon products on-line. This statement of our privacy policies outlines the information Avon will collect and how we will use that information. This policy statement will also instruct you on what to do if you want Avon to remove your personal information collected or stored during previous visits to Avon websites. 

### II. Use of Personal Information

Avon will not collect or retain any information about you personally (that is, your name, address, telephone number, or email address) unless you provide it to us voluntarily. If you do not want any personal information collected, please do not submit it to us. If you have already submitted this information and would like for us to remove it from our records, please contact us at the email address listed at the bottom of this policy statement. We will use reasonable efforts to delete your information from our existing files. If you do provide us with personal information, we may retain and use that information for several purposes. First, we may store and process the information to better understand your needs and how we can improve our products and services. Second, we may retain information about your previous purchases of Avon products in order to customize our website services for your future visits to the site. Finally, if you register as an "A-List Member" at our on-line shopping site, we will collect and retain data about your shopping history and will use that information the next time you visit our site to suggest products or other offers that may be of particular interest to you. We will also use your email address to send you updates about new products, specials and other items of interest. Your e-mail address or other contact information will not be provided to any third party without your prior consent. 

### III. Bulletin Boards and Forums

Avon's websites and online areas operate several bulletin boards and forums, including the Women's Running Forum and The Crusade Bulletin Board, that allow you to participate in on-line discussions with other Avon website users. When you contribute a message to one of these discussions, certain personal information will become part of your posting and will be stored by Avon. In addition, your e-mail address and any other personal information you include will become available to other participants who may read or reply to your message. By participating in any Avon bulletin board or forum, you consent to the Terms and Conditions displayed at each bulletin board or forum. All submissions become the property of Avon. The Crusade Bulletin Board is part of Avon's Breast Cancer Awareness Crusade and provides a venue for open and supportive dialogue about breast cancer. Avon will not use any personal information contained in postings to the Crusade Bulletin Board for marketing or any other purpose. 

### IV. Children

Avon does not intend to collect any personal information (such as, name, address, telephone number, age or email address) from persons under thirteen years of age. If a parent or guardian of a child who has provided us with such information would like the information deleted from our records, he or she should contact us at the email address or phone number listed at the bottom of this policy statement. We will make reasonable efforts to delete the child's information from our existing files. 

### V. Technical Information Collected Automatically

In some cases, we may collect certain technical information, which does not allow us to identify you personally, pertaining to your use of our website. For example, on the Web such information may include the type of Internet Browser or computer operating system that you are using and the domain name of the website from which you linked to our site or advertisement. 

### VII. Information Placed Automatically On Your Computer's Hard Drive

When you view one of our websites, we may store some information in the form of a "cookie" or similar file that is automatically downloaded to your computer. Cookies enable us, among other things, to tailor a website or advertisement to better match your interests and preferences. If you do not want cookies sent to or stored on your system, most Internet Browsers will allow you to erase cookies from your computer hard drive, prevent them from being stored or trigger a warning before a cookie is stored. Please refer to your Browser instructions or help screen to learn more about these functions.
