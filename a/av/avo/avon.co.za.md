Avon Cosmetics Limited is committed to protecting the privacy of every individual who visits our website, communicates with us or purchases Avon products online. The information you give to us is used to process your orders and to provide you with an efficient and personal shopping experience.

Our Privacy Policy helps you understand what information Avon will collect and how the information will be used.

We will collect and process your personal information in accordance with the Data Protection Act 1998 and any other applicable legislation as amended from time to time.

 **How we collect and use personal information**  
We will only collect personal information from you if you specifically and knowingly provided such information to us for example:-

  * to send you a brochure
  * to put you in contact with a local Representative, Sales Leader or Area Manager
  * to fulfil an order or provide you with your account details
  * when you purchase Avon products through the Website
  * when you enter any competitions or prize draws that we advertise on the website
  * when you request Avon to send e-mail or text communications with product information



  
If you use the internet ordering system, whether as a direct customer, Representative or Sales Leader, we will identify you and keep a record of any transactions undertaken through that system. This information is used to manage your account and process any orders you make.

In some instances your personal data may be transmitted to any of our associate companies around the world.

 **Sharing of information with third parties**  
To fulfil your requirements we may need to give essential personal details to a third party, for example, our delivery agents. We may also use the information we collect to notify you about new products and special offers we think you'll be interested in, important changes to the website, or for other marketing purposes we think would interest you. If you do not want us to do this, you can tell us by clicking on the 'opt out' box provided.

 **Using your personal information**  
If you provide us with personal information, we may retain and use the information for the following purpose:

  * to store and process the information to better understand your needs and how we can improve our products and services;
  * to retain the information about your previous purchases in order to customise our website services for your future visits to the site;
  * to use your e-mail address or mobile telephone number to send you information about new products, special offers and other items of interest;
  * to retain certain information for invoicing and delivery purposes.

Wherever you provide personal information about yourself you will see the 'information padlock' symbol. This is an official symbol of the Data Protection Commissioner/National Consumer Council, and it is there to alert you to the fact that your information is being collected. (You can click on the symbol at any time to return to this page for more information.)

All your data will be stored securely for the duration of your relationship with us and for 2 years thereafter.

 **Sharing of information with third parties**  
If you become a customer, Representative or Sales Leader we may need to give essential personal details to an authorised third party. Examples include fulfilling orders, carrying out surveys, delivery of your orders, analysing data, marketing assistance, processing credit card payments, credit reference checking and providing general customer service. We may also use the information to notify you about new products and special offers we think you'll be interested in, important changes to the website, or for other marketing purposes we think would interest you.

We may also provide your personal information to authorised third parties if we are under a legal obligation to do so or in order to enforce or apply our Terms and Conditions.

We may also transfer some of your personal details to any other company within Avonâ€™s group and business contacts located in other countries outside of the European Economic Area including the United States even where the country or territory in question does not maintain the same standards of data protection as within the European Union.

If you do not want us to do this, you can tell us by clicking on the 'opt out' box provided.

 **How we protect your information**  
We are aware that you may be concerned about the privacy and confidentiality of your personal information, including credit card and delivery address information, therefore we have taken precautions to ensure that this information is safe and secure. If you are registered with us, your online account information is protected by a password chosen by you. Access to your online account requires your username and password and we recommend that you do not disclose this information to any other person.
