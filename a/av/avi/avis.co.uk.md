# Privacy Policy | Avis Car Hire UK - Car Rental

## Controller of information

Any personal information provided to or gathered by this website is controlled primarily by Avis Budget EMEA Ltd, whose registered office is at Avis House, Park Road, Bracknell RG12 2EW, United Kingdom. 

## What data does Avis collect?

**Booking Information:** When booking car rental services we ask for your name, postal address, telephone number and email address. This helps us to process your booking, to contact you if we have any problems with your request or to send you an electronic confirmation of the booking. If you pay for your rental at the time of booking you will be asked to enter your payment card type, number and expiration date to enable us to take your payment.  
 **Online Account:** Online Account: When you make a booking, we will give you the opportunity to create an online account. If you accept we will store the personal details you provide in our customer database. This will enable you to make future bookings more rapidly.  Deletion of your online account will not delete the personal data that we hold on file.  You are able to view and correct the personal data we hold at any time, see the Accessing and updating information section on how to do so.  
 **Avis Preferred:** If you join our Avis Preferred service we will create an online account for you. Your account will include all the information you enter into the Avis Preferred Membership Form.  
 **Wizard Card Holders:** If you are a Wizard card holder we link your membership number to the information we keep in our main customer database in order to speed up your booking process.   
History of Transactions: We will maintain electronic records of all rental agreements and other transactions you enter into with Avis.  
 **IP address:** We collect your IP address when you visit our site. This only identifies your ISP (Internet Service Provider) and does not contain any information about you as an individual. We use this information to help us understand more about where our site traffic originates.   
**Cookies:** Our website uses "cookie" technology. "Cookies" are encrypted strings of text that a website stores on a user's computer. Cookies enable us to customise our website and offerings to your needs and provide you with a better online experience. In addition, cookies are used to measure usage of various pages on our website to help us make our information more pertinent to your needs and easy for you to access. The types of cookies that we use are referred to as "session" cookies and "persistent" cookies.  
Session cookies are temporary and are automatically deleted once you leave our website. Persistent cookies remain on your computer hard drive until you delete them. We do not use cookies to gather information concerning your visits to other sites, nor ascertain any personally identifiable information about you apart from what you voluntarily provide us in your dealings with our website. Cookies do not corrupt or damage your computer, programs, or computer files.

## How does Avis use your data?

**Sharing Information**  
Avis will never release your personal details to any company that is not a member of the Avis Rent A Car System for marketing purposes.   
As we are part of an international group operating the Avis Rent A Car System, we will from time to time share with other companies operating the Avis Rent A Car System (located inside and outside Europe) information relating to our car rental service operations, which may include your personal information. Unless you have given us your consent your personal information will not be used for any other purpose.  
 **Avis online competitions**  
If you enter any competitions we offer on our site, we will ask you to enter certain personal information so we can notify you if necessary. Exact terms and conditions and rules of each competition will be posted at the time and may vary. If a prize is offered through a third party we may need to disclose information to the relevant third party in order to facilitate the distribution of any prizes.  
 **Avis online surveys**  
When you participate in any online surveys you may be asked to supply certain personal information, for example age or income. Provision of all or any of the requested information is voluntary. Survey results will only be used to improve the Avis car hire experience for our customers and not for any other purpose.   


## How does Avis protect your data?

Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption technology is used to protect personal information such as credit card details when making a booking.  
Any personal information that we hold as part of your customer profile will be held in a database with physical and technological security controls and procedures in place.  
Only the last 4 digits of your credit card number will be displayed when viewing, amending or deleting your credit card details or on any booking on our website.   


## Our Commitment To Data Security

The security of your personal information is important to us. When you enter sensitive information (such as your payment card number) during any registration or booking process, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).

We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personally identifiable information and personal data submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

With this in mind we would ask you not to enter any payment card number into fields on our websites, unless that the field is specifically marked for that purpose.  


## Accessing and updating information

You are welcome to see the information held about you at any time and to make the necessary amendments to keep the information up to date.  
To view your personal information please contact **ukmarketing@avis.co.uk** quoting your name and address and either your drivers licence number or date of birth (for verification).  


## Subscribing to our email newsletter

Our email newsletter provides subscribers with the latest information on prices, offers, products, services and competitions. We will only send our newsletter to users who have agreed to receive it.  
When you agree to receive our newsletter we will ask for a minimum of your email address. Over time we may ask for additional personal information about you. Providing this information is voluntary and will be used to customise the content of your newsletter so it is relevant to you.   
You can unsubscribe at any time and will be given the option to do so on our website and from each newsletter we send you.
