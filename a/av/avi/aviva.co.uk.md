We will always be clear to explain when and why we need this information and the purposes for which we will use it and will obtain your explicit consent to use sensitive personal information
  * Information about your employment, including salary
  * National Insurance Number and
  * Your marketing preferences



**Your car** : we may collect vehicle registration details and data about your car from publicly available sources. 

For more information about data use related to your motor insurance please click below. 

### Motor

We may use your information to allow us to detect and prevent fraudulent applications and claims. For details relating to information held about you on the Claims Underwriting and Exchange Register and Motor Insurance Anti-Fraud and Theft Register please visit [www.insurancedatabases.co.uk](http://www.insurancedatabases.co.uk/).

For details relating to information held about you by the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) please visit [www.dvla.gov.uk](http://www.dvla.gov.uk/).

Information about your insurance policy will be added to the Motor Insurance Database (MID) managed by the Motor Insurers’ Bureau (MIB). MID and the data stored on it may be used by certain statutory and/or authorised bodies including the police, the DVlA, the DVLNI, the Insurance Fraud Bureau and other bodies permitted by law. This information may be used for purposes permitted by law, which include but are not limited to:

  * Electronic Licensing
  * Continuous insurance enforcement
  * Law enforcement (prevention, detection, apprehension and/or prosecution of offenders)
  * The provision of government services and/or other services aimed at reducing the level and incidence of uninsured driving.



If you are involved in a road traffic accident (either in the UK, the European Economic Area or certain other territories), insurers and/or the MIB may search the MID to obtain relevant information.

Persons (including his or her appointed representative) pursuing a claim in respect of a road traffic accident (including citizens of other countries) may also obtain relevant information which is held on the MID. It is vital that the MID holds your current registration number. If it is incorrectly shown on the MID you are at risk of having your vehicle seized by the police.

You can check that your current registration number details are shown on the MID at [www.askmid.com](http://www.askmid.com/).

Information which is supplied to fraud prevention agencies and databases such a IDLS and MID can include details such as your name, address and date of birth together with details of any injury arising from a claim.

Your data may be supplied to databases in order to facilitate automatic no claim discount validation checks.

Under your policy you must tell us about any incident (such as an accident or theft) which may or may not give rise to a claim. When you tell us about an incident, we will pass information relating to it to the fraud prevention agencies and databases such as IDSL.

##### How we will use your data – Driving Licence Number

Insurance underwriting purposes i.e. to examine the potential risk in relation to your (and/or a third party’s) prospective policy so that we can:

  * Provide your (or any person included on the proposal) Driving Licence Number (DLN) to the DVLA to confirm your (or the relevant person included on the proposal) licence status, entitlement and relevant restriction information and endorsement/conviction data. Searches may be carried out prior to the date of the insurance policy and at any point throughout the duration of your insurance policy and at any point throughout the duration of your insurance policy including at the mid-term adjustment and renewal stage. A search of the DLN with the DVLA should not show a footprint against your (or another relevant person included on the proposal) driving licence.
  * Searches may be carried out at point of quote and if an insurance policy is incepted at renewal stage.



Please note that if you give us false or inaccurate information it may invalidate your insurance policy/prospective insurance policy or it could affect the amount we pay to settle any claims you make under the policy.

##### Fraud prevention and detection

In order to prevent and detect fraud we may at any time:

  * undertake searches against your (or any person included on the proposal) DLN against details held by the DVLA to confirm your licence status, entitlement and relevant restriction information and endorsement/conviction data. This helps insurers check information to prevent fraud and reduce incidences of negligent misrepresentation and non-disclosure. A search of the DLN with the DVLA should not show a footprint against your (or another relevant person included on the proposal) driving licence;
  * Share information about you with other organisations and public bodies
  * undertake credit searches and additional fraud searches;
  * check and/or file your details with fraud prevention agencies and databases, and if you give us false or inaccurate information and we suspect fraud, we will record this.



We can supply on request further details of the agencies and databases we access or contribute to and how this information may be used. If you require further details contact us at Policy Investigation Unit, Aviva, Cruan Business Centre, Westerhill Business Park, 123 Westerhill Road, Bishopbriggs, Glasgow G64 2QR. Telephone 0345 300 0597. Email: PIUUKDI@AVIVA.COM.

We and other organisations may also search these agencies and databases to:

  * help make decisions about the provision and administration of insurance, credit and related services for you and members of your household;
  * trace debtors or beneficiaries, recover debt, prevent fraud and to manage your accounts or insurance policies;
  * check your identity to prevent money laundering, unless you furnish us with other satisfactory proof of identity.
  * Under the conditions of your policy you must tell us about any insurance related incidents (such as fire, water damage, theft or an accident) whether or not they give rise to a claim. When you tell us about an incident we will pass information relating to it to the fraud prevention agencies and databases such as IDSL.



You can ask for more information about this. If you require such information, please contact Aviva Insurance Limited

  * We may search these databases when you apply for insurance, in the event of any incident or claim, or at time of renewal to validate your claims history or that of any other person or property likely to be involved in the policy or claim. 



You should show these notices to anyone insured to drive the vehicle(s) covered under the policy.

##### How your data is used and shared by Insurers and Databases in relation to motor insurance

The data you provide will be used by us and shared with other insurers as well as certain statutory and other authorised bodies for: 

  * Insurance underwriting purposes i.e. to examine the potential risk in relation to your (and/or a third party’s) prospective policy so that we can: 
    * Consider whether to accept the relevant risk;
    * Make decisions about the provision and administration of insurance and related services for you (and members of your household);
    * Validate your (or any person or property likely to be involved in the policy or claim) claims history (at any time including upon application for insurance, in the event of an accident or a claim, or at a time of renewal). 
  * Management Information purposes. To analyse insurance and other markets for the purposes of: 
    * Portfolio assessment;
    * Risk assessment;
    * Performance reporting;
    * Management reporting
  * Anti-fraud purposes. To detect and prevent fraudulent claims and/or activities by: 
    * Sharing information and you with other organisations and public bodies including the police;
    * Tracing debtors or beneficiaries, recovering debt, managing your accounts and/or insurance policies;
    * Undertaking fraud searches. Insurers pass information to fraud prevention agencies and databases including the Claims Underwriting and Exchange Register and where appropriate the Motor Insurance anti-Fraud and Theft Register by Insurance Database Services Limited (IDSL). This helps insurers check information and prevent fraudulent claims. When we deal with your request for insurance we may search these registers.
  * Compliance with legal obligations and responsibilities.
  * Claims management – In the event of a claim we may need to disclose information with any other party involved in that claim such as third parties involved in the incident, their insurer, solicitor or representative and medical teams, the police or other investigators. We also may have to investigate your claims and conviction history.
  * Complaints management – If you make a complaint about the service we have provided, we may be obliged to forward details about your complaints, including your personal information, to the relevant ombudsman.

Online channels
    

We may use and share information from or with online sources, such as websites, social media and information sharing platforms. This information may be used to help tailor and improve our services and communicate with you effectively, as we know many of our customers use a range of media channels.

Where we use or share information from or with these sources, we will respect any permissions you have set about how you would like your information to be used. 

We recommend you routinely review the privacy notices and preference settings that are available to you on any social media platforms as well as your preferences within the Profile section of MyAviva.

Information collected from third parties
    

We use information about you or the property we insure for you, from publicly available sources such as:

  * Electoral roll
  * British Geological Survey



We also obtain information about you from credit reference agencies and similar third parties. For more information please click below.

### Credit searches and use of Third Party information 

To ensure we have the necessary facts to assess your insurance risk, verify your identity, to help prevent fraud and to provide you with our best premium and payment options, we may obtain information relating to you from third parties at quotation and renewal and in certain circumstances where policy amendments are requested. This information may include a quotation search from a credit reference agency which will appear on your credit report and will be visible to other credit providers. It will be clear that this is a quotation rather than a credit application by you to pay by monthly instalments.

We are a responsible provider of credit which is regulated by the Consumer Credit Act and we take these responsibilities seriously to ensure our customers are able to meet their monthly instalment commitments. Where you agree to pay monthly under an Aviva credit agreement, the status of your quotation search from our credit reference agency will be updated to reflect your credit application and this will be visible to other credit providers. Credit reference agencies may keep a record of the search. We may also pass to credit reference agencies information we hold about you and your payment record. The information will be used by other credit lenders for making credit decisions about you and the people with whom you are financially associated for fraud prevention, money laundering prevention and for tracing debtors.

We may obtain information about you from medical professionals, or your employer. We will always seek your permission to contact these people for your information.

We may obtain information about you from our third party suppliers and other third party databases, such as commercial property sites, government sites for marketing insights, pricing research, product development, business strategy and to detect and prevent fraudulent activity. 

How we use information to help you
    

**We may use information to:**

  * Administer quotes and policies, including to: 
    * improve your experience by reducing the number of questions we need to ask you

    * understand your risk so as to offer you our best price
    * verify your identity and carry out anti-fraud checks,
    * provide you with premium and payment options,
    * check that you can afford a credit agreement

### Insurance Administration 

Your information may be used for the purposes of insurance administration by the insurer, its associated companies and agents and by re-insurers. It may be disclosed to regulatory bodies for the purposes of monitoring and/or enforcing the insurer’s compliance with any regulatory rules/codes. Your information may also by used for offering renewal, research and statistical purposes and crime prevention. 

If you give us information about another person, in doing so you confirm that they have given you permission to provide it to us and for us to be able to process their personal data (including any sensitive personal data) and also that you have told them who we are and what we will use their data for, as set out in this notice. 

In assessing your application or at renewal, the insurer or its agents may undertake checks against publicly available information (such as electoral roll, county court judgements, bankruptcy orders or repossessions). Similar checks may be made in assessing any claims made.
