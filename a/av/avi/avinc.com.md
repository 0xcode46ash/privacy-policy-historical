I. Types of Information we collect and how we collect it**

In discussing the types of information we collect from customers and visitors to our websites we use the term “Customer Information” as a broad, general term that refers to any information relating to you and your AeroVironment and/or EV Solutions™ products or service (“EV Charging Products”), including Account Information, Service & Performance Information, Commerce Information, and Web Site Information. 

The following are specific types of Customer Information that we collect from customers and visitors to our websites:

**“Account Information”** means information about your AV account, including, but not limited to, your name, address, e-mail address, telephone number, credit card information, the model and serial number of your EV Charging Products (as applicable), and appointment scheduling information. We collect Account Information directly from you when you activate or change your account, or purchase products or services from us.  We may combine information we obtain from third parties with Account Information we collect.  
**  
“Service & Performance Information”** means information necessary for us to provide services related to your EV Charging Products, including site assessment, installation, warranty and non-warranty services, as well as data, including software files, with detailed information about the operation of your EV Charging Products, electric vehicle charging practices, and type of electric vehicle. Examples of Service & Performance Information include your product software version number, details regarding your home’s configuration and electrical infrastructure, product information and information you provide to our customer service representatives and/or electrical contractors regarding the functioning of your electric vehicle or EV Charging Products. In addition, we may collect diagnostic logs and other performance information for one or more EV Charging Products for quality control, electrical contractor performance, product improvement and troubleshooting purposes, as well as to identify trends that may be useful to AV and its partners and affiliates in the electric vehicle, utility, power generation and charging industries. Service & Performance Information is generally linked to or associated with your Account Information.  
**  
“Commerce Information”** means personally identifiable information about you that enables a commerce partner to fulfill your request to participate in a business transaction. From time to time, we may present on-screen offers or enable you to buy goods and services from us or third parties. We will only collect and send on your behalf information such as your name and address and your interest in a specific offer or transaction to the commerce partners that are sponsoring the promotion or transaction if you take advantage of such an offer or engage in a transaction. In addition to fulfilling your request, such commerce partner [or we?] may also use your Commerce Information to send you other information in which you might be interested, consistent with its own privacy policies.  
**  
“Web Site Information”** means information collected and stored on our web servers when you become a registered user of, or visit, our EV Solutions™ commerce websites (“EV Commerce Websites”). If you are a customer or register on our EV Commerce Websites to access your AV account, we may collect information that you provide us (including your email address) and use it in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Whether or not you are an AV customer or register on our EV Commerce Website, we may collect information about visitors to our EV Commerce Websites as follows:

**Cookies**  
We use cookies to customize our EV Commerce Websites for returning visitors. These cookies remain on your computer and are automatically retrieved when you visit our EV Commerce Websites at a later time. These cookies contain only information concerning the type of customer and frequently visited pages. No other Customer Information is stored on cookies. If you are uncomfortable with cookies, you may disable them on your computer. Disabling cookies may affect user functionality.  The design of the EV Commerce Websites allows access to most offerings with cookies disabled; however, visitors who have disabled cookie processing will not be able to use AV’s personalized account management function.  
**  
Web Logs**

AV also maintains standard web logs that record data about all visitors to our EV Commerce Websites. These logs may contain:  
• The Internet domain from which you access such Websites.  
• Your IP address (your computer is automatically assigned an IP address when you surf the Internet. Your IP address is either static or dynamic. A static IP address may be identifiable to you; a dynamic address is usually not identifiable to you).  
• The type of browser and operating system you use.  
• The date and time you visited this site.  
• The pages you viewed on the EV Commerce Websites.  
• The address of the website from which you linked.

AV uses web log and clickstream information to help us design our site, to identify popular site features and to make the site more useful for visitors. Web logs are recorded in sequential files, and we normally do not attempt to identify individuals from these logs. However, we may use web logs to identify persons attempting to break into, disrupt, or damage our Site. We may share web log information with law enforcement personnel if we believe evidence exists, or is likely to occur, of a violation of federal, state or local laws or regulations.

Links to other websites: When you visit our website, you may find opportunities to link to websites of third parties. When you click through to these third party websites, AV’s Privacy Policy no longer applies. We recommend that you read the privacy policy for any third party websites.

**II. Use of Customer Information**

AV may also disclose Customer Information to any person performing audit, legal, operational or other similar services for AV.  Whenever reasonably possible we will require any recipient of Customer Information for these purposes to agree in writing to hold the information in confidence, to use the information only for the permitted purpose, and to return or destroy the information when the services are completed.

We may share with third parties certain pieces of non-personally identifiable information and aggregated non-personally identifiable information, for example, the number of customers located in a certain geographic area or how many hours a day customers with a particular type of electric vehicle are using their EV Charging Products. Such information will not identify you individually.
