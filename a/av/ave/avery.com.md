Avery Dennison protects its consumers' right to privacy. The following guidelines outline fair and appropriate handling of all consumer information passed through this Web site.

**Avery Dennison Worldwide Office Products Consumer Privacy Policy Guidelines**  
We at Avery Dennison Worldwide Office Products value our consumers and take great pride in assuring that their privacy is maintained. With electronic mail, Internet, and other online resources growing exponentially, it is important that we maintain an environment where our consumers feel comfortable that the information they provide us will not be misused.

This protection of consumer privacy is best achieved through cooperation between the business community, customers, service providers, government agencies, and information collectors. We at Avery Dennison, believe every consumer should be able to conduct business with us without having their personal information used for unrelated purposes.

This document provides guidelines that Avery Dennison Worldwide Office Products uses to ensure proper handling of all consumer information.

**Opt-Out Process**  
We believe our consumers should have the right to decline disclosure of personal information that is collected on our databases. The records for those individuals who request that their personal information not be used for future mailings or phone calls will be marked in our database so that their names will be excluded from any contact in the future.

Currently, we mark consumer records in two ways:

  1. **Do not mail** excludes the consumer's name from our direct mail campaigns
  2. **Do not call** indicates that the consumer does not wish to receive any phone communication (i.e., phone research or telemarketing campaigns) from Avery Dennison.



_Consumers can request removal of their name and consumer information by the following methods:_

  * Writing Avery Dennison Consumer Service Center with the request:  
Avery Dennison Consumer Service Center  
PO Box 129  
Brea, CA 92822-0129 
  * Calling Avery Dennison Consumer Service Center:   
(888) 283-7967
  * Faxing Avery Dennison Consumer Service Center:

**Avery Dennison Consumer Information Sources**  
 _Avery Dennison's consumer information is collected when consumers:_

  * _Call Avery Dennison Consumer Service Center (CSC)_. When consumers call the CSC, we might ask for their names, address, phone number, and other consumer profile information that helps us better serve their needs in the future. Consumer information is collected only if the consumer has given us permission to do so. This information helps facilitate communication with our consumers by allowing us to quickly and efficiently identify the consumer.
  

  * _Respond to various marketing campaigns (i.e., advertisements, business reply cards, offers, etc.)_. This consumer information collected is completely voluntary. In most cases, consumers are given a choice to have their names removed by checking the appropriate box on the questionnaire.
  

  * _Visit the AveryÂ® products Web site (www.avery.com)_. Consumers might be asked to respond to survey questionnaires or to register to receive future mailings and product updates. Consumers might also be asked to provide consumer information before downloading Avery brand software products.



**Types of Information**  
The consumer information we collect allows us to better understand our consumers and their product and service preferences. Consumer profiles help us develop products and programs which meet our consumers' needs. The typical consumer profile information collected is: name and postal address, phone or fax number, types of printers used, job title, Avery brand product usage, and stores or dealers used to purchase Avery products.

**Avery Brand Online Services**  
Avery Dennison Worldwide Office Products' consumer Web site is www.avery.com. Consumers that visit our site can preview product information, locate dealers, and download software templates. From time to time, we ask our consumers to respond to surveys or questionnaires, to register to receive future mailings or product updates, or to download Avery software products.

**Information collected about a consumer may include:**

  * Contact or locator information (such as name, postal, and email addresses);
  * Navigational information (such as data revealing consumers' preferences or the choices they make among the range of products, services, or sites);
  * Other consumer profile information that helps us better target our products and services.



**Uses of Consumer Information**  
Consumer information may be used for various research projects aimed to better understand Avery products consumer preferences. The data may be used to evaluate consumer reactions to content, products, and services offered online. It may also include using the consumer's name and address for direct mail or other consumer communication methods.

On occasion, we may also disclose names and information collected to approved firms that conduct market research for Avery Dennison or to companies that do joint promotional activities with Avery Dennison. Those consumers who have requested removal of their name and consumer information should not be contacted.

**Email Processes**  
We would only use online email communication with consumers who have given us permission to do so. When used, we will provide our consumers a mechanism through which they can request that Avery Dennison omit their email addresses from lists or databases. We will always provide our consumers with an email address, postal address, and telephone number at which we can be contacted.
