**Audio Video Revolution Privacy Policy**

The Audio Revolution, Inc., producer of Audio Video Revolution and its related content and service sites, is firmly committed to respecting the privacy of our readers, those people who visit and/or use our web property. The following policy explains how your personal information will be treated. Please check back periodically, as these policies may change from time to time; however, our fundamental commitment to protecting reader privacy will not change.

**What We Do With Sweepstakes Information**  
Audio Video Revolution collects contact information (e.g., e-mail addresses, phone numbers and street addresses) and demographic information (e.g., zip code, age or income level) for each monthly contest. This information is provided to the sponsor company that is running each sweepstakes that you have actually entered. We also use this information to contact the reader if he or she is a contest winner. This information may be used by Audio Video Revolution (or our sponsors) to notify viewers of products and/or services that may be of interest to them. This is sometimes done through our weekly e-mail newsletter further discussed below. You may choose to tell us that you do not wish to have your information used as a basis for further contact with you, and we will respect your wishes; you may also update your personal information in our database. On occasion, summaries and aggregations of profile data collected on contest entry forms are shared with our advertisers and other partners.

**Minors**  
Our promotions are not open to those under 18 years of age. We do not knowingly market to or solicit information from persons under 18.

**Newsletter and Database Information; Actions You Can Take**  
Audio Video Revolution offers a weekly newsletter to subscribers listed in its database.

The Audio Revolution Inc. and its publications are compliant with California's anti-SPAM law (Business & Professional Code SECT 17529).

If you do not wish to receive future offers or information from us, you may opt out by using the automated link on our website to remove yourself from our database. Please note that by using this automated link, you will be removed from our database within approximately 24 hours. Please be aware that if you thereafter enter any of our sweepstakes or re-subscribe to the newsletter, you will be added back to our database.

If you would like to change or update your current data (e.g., your e-mail address) in our database, simply e-mail [Jerry@avrev.com](mailto:Jerry@avrev.com) and we’ll take quick action.

If you are having problems removing yourself from our database via the automated link, please e-mail [Jerry@avrev.com](mailto:Jerry@avrev.com) or call us toll-free at 866.235.0069 and we’ll manually remove you from our database.

Flames, e-mails with profanity, threats or other abusive content will be deleted, reported to the appropriate authorities or ISPs, or referred to our legal counsel for appropriate action. Please remember, we only want people in our database who are interested in and excited about our newsletter and related correspondence.

**Surveys**  
Audio Video Revolution occasionally offers online surveys to our readers. Online surveys are used so that we can gather information to better serve you. We may share summaries and aggregations of profile data collected on surveys with advertisers and other partners. You are not required to complete online surveys, sweepstakes or promotions.

**Site Visit Information**  
We gather information on site activity, such as the reader’s domain name/IP address (e.g., whether the reader is logged on from netscape.com or yale.edu), referral data (e.g., the address of the last URL a reader visited prior to clicking through to our site), and browser/platform type (e.g., a Netscape browser on a Macintosh platform). We use this information on an aggregate, anonymous basis, to improve site content and target advertising. We also may disclose aggregated information (for example, the percentage of our readers visiting the product reviews section) to third parties. When we do present such aggregated site activity to third parties, no one will be able to identify you or contact you.

**Links**  
Our site contains links to other sites, such as those of our advertisers. We provide these links solely as a convenience to our readers. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the content or privacy practices of such other sites, including the accuracy, completeness, reliability or suitability of the information. We encourage our readers to be aware when they leave our site and strongly recommend that you read the privacy policies of such other sites, as such other sites may collect information about you.

**Cookies**  
Cookies are pieces of information stored directly on the computer that you are using. Cookies can contain a variety of information, such as a simple count of how often you visit a Web Site or information that allows the customization of a Web Site for your use. The use of advertising cookies sent by third-party servers is standard in the Internet industry. If you click on one of our banner ads, you may get cookies from our advertisers that allow the tracking of your response to our advertisements. These cookies do not identify you personally and are solely for the purpose of assisting us in measuring the effectiveness of advertisements placed on our site.
