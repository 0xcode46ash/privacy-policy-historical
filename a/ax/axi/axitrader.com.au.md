The personal information we collect about you may include:

  * Information you provide to us on applications and other forms, such as your name, address, date of birth, occupation, employer, assets and income, telephone or mobile number, email address, tax file number, nominated Bank account details;
  * Information about your transactions with us and with our affiliates;
  * Information we receive from consumer-reporting agencies, such as your credit history and creditworthiness, and other entities not affiliated with AxiCorp; and

We take all reasonable steps to protect your personal information from misuse, loss, unauthorised access, modification or disclosure. We limit access to your personal information to those employees who need to know in order to conduct our business, service your account and providing you with a broad range of products and services. Our employees are required to maintain and protect the confidentiality of your personal information and must follow established procedures to do so.

About Cookies

Cookies are small files containing information that a Web site uses to track its visitors. AxiCorp may set and access AxiCorp cookies on your computer, enabling us to learn which advertisements and promotions bring users to our Web site. AxiCorp or any of its affiliates or divisions may use such cookies.

About Hyperlinks

AxiCorp's Web sites may contain hyperlinks or "links" to other sites, and other sites may "link" to our sites. These Web sites that may be linking to or from AxiCorp's sites may have their own privacy policies. AxiCorp's privacy policy applies exclusively to AxiCorp and information collected by us. AxiCorp is not responsible for the privacy policies or the content of the sites you link to, nor do we have control over the use or security of information provided by you or collected by those sites. If you choose to link to one of these Web sites, you may be asked to supply registration or other information. It is important that you realise this information is going to a third-party, and you should become familiar with the privacy policy provided by that third-party.

AxiCorp Security Technology

AxiCorp uses GeoTrust Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption technology in order to protect the information that you submit to us. This type of technology is designed to protect you from having your information intercepted by anyone other than AxiCorp while it is being transmitted to us. We also use other safeguards such as firewalls, authentication systems (e.g., passwords and personal identification numbers) and access control mechanisms to control unauthorised access to systems and data. However, you acknowledge and accept that any services provided through the Website involve transmissions over the internet and that such transmissions are therefore subject to the internet’s inherent risks. Whilst we acknowledge our responsibility to take reasonable security precautions, you also acknowledge and accept that, as with any network, you may also be exposed to unauthorised programs transmitted by third parties, electronic trespassing and/or the failure of information and data to reach their intended destinations and/or erroneous receipt or misdirection of such information. Although our and our suppliers’ privacy and security features are designed to reduce these risks, we cannot guarantee that the risk can be eliminated completely. You therefore acknowledge that we will not be liable for any breach of confidence or unauthorised access and use arising as a result of such event.

Disclosure to Non-Affiliated Third Parties and Regulatory Bodies

If you do not provide us with your personal information, or if you provide us with inaccurate or incomplete information, we may not be able to provide you with our services, including giving you access to our Websites.

Accessing and Revisiting Your Personal Information
