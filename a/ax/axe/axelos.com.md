# Privacy

## Introduction

The purpose of this privacy policy is to set out the manner and purposes for which TSO will obtain and process your personal information. By using this website, you are consenting to the collection and use of your personal information in the way we describe in this policy and our [Terms and Conditions](http://www.axelos.com/axelos-Help-Pages/Terms-and-Conditions-of-Sale/).

## Who we are

This website is hosted and managed by TSO (The Stationery Office Limited). Registered address: 29 St John's Lane, London, EC1M 4NA. TSO is a registered Data Controller as defined by the UK Data Protection Act 1998 (Act). We obtain, process and store personal information in accordance with the Act and all other applicable UK privacy legislation.

## Obtaining your personal information

We may obtain personal information about you when you register to use this website, place an order with us or when you provide feedback about our products or services.

## Processing your personal information

We collect and process data that you provide for specific purposes. You will be asked to provide information about yourself when you use certain site facilities, in order to complete your request or transaction. This may include personal information such as your name, email addresses, mailing address and telephone number. We use this data to provide you with the information, products or services that you request from us and to communicate with you. We may keep a record of any contacts you have with us. We may use the information that you provide for record keeping, statistical or research purposes.

We only retain this information where required to do so by law; for the length of time needed to provide the service or information you have requested (including any retention period specified by law or by government policy), or for the length of time that you choose to store information or permit us to contact you if you have registered with our website.

In order to source the product that you require and ensure that it is delivered to the delivery address that you have specified as quickly as possible, it sometimes may be necessary for us to pass your delivery address details to an external publisher or supplier acting on our behalf to enable them to dispatch the goods that you have ordered directly to you. However, your order will always be managed by TSO and we will only provide our suppliers with the minimum information necessary to facilitate the delivery of the goods to you, such as your name, address and the details of the products to be supplied. Our suppliers have provided sufficient security guarantees in relation to any personal information that we might provide them with for these purposes and they are required to act only on our instructions in relation to any such information.

## Direct marketing material

We will use your personal information to keep you informed of products, services and events that we feel may be of interest to you or your business. We may also use your personal information to keep you informed of new and/or existing products that are similar to those which you have previously purchased.

You may at any time ask us to cease or not commence sending you direct marketing material by contacting our customer services division on +44 (0)870 600 5522 or [tsoproductupdates@tso.co.uk](mailto:tsoproductupdates@tso.co.uk).

Upon receipt of notification that you do not wish to receive marketing material from us, we will action your request within a reasonable time period.

## Email marketing communications

TSO offers a free email newsletter subscription service to keep you informed of our products and services. All recipients of our newsletter have either consented to receiving such material or have placed an order with us for similar products or services.

We incorporate a tracking system in our email marketing communications which allows us to monitor whether the email has been opened and which links are the most popular. This allows us to tailor and refine our service to ensure that the emails you receive are relevant to your interests.

Where you have consented to receiving email marketing material from us or are currently receiving material relating to similar products or services, you may at any time ask us to cease sending you such material by sending an email to [tsoproductupdates@tso.co.uk](mailto:tsoproductupdates@tso.co.uk) with the subject header 'Unsubscribe', or go to your free updates page (you will need to log in if you have not already done so) and click the Unsubscribe link at the foot of the page. Unsubscribe instructions are also clearly outlined at the bottom of every direct marketing email that we send you.

## Cookies

Cookies are small files that are often created when you visit a website, and which are stored in the cookie directory of your computer. A cookie often includes an anonymous unique identifier. Cookies do not damage your computer. Each website can send its own cookie to your browser if your browser's preferences allow it, but to protect your privacy your browser only permits a website to access the cookies it has already sent to you, not the cookies sent to you by other sites. You do not have to accept cookies. You can decide if you want to accept cookies by changing the settings on your browser to accept all cookies, reject all cookies, or notify you when a cookie is set.

If you would rather not allow our storage or access to cookies that may contain your aggregate information then you should make appropriate arrangements to deactivate the cookie function on your web browser. Further information regarding the use of cookies, including their deactivation can be found at www.allaboutcookies.org. This website is run by the Interactive Advertising Bureau and provides guidance to users on how to turn off cookies.

TSO analyzes customer statistics, sales, traffic patterns and related site information. In order to facilitate this, where possible, our web server may automatically recognize the domain name and email address of users of this website, by using cookies. We also use cookies to operate the shopping basket system in our online bookshop. This may include the auto-completion of financial information.

For more information on the cookies used on this website, please visit our [Cookies page](http://www.axelos.com/axelos-Help-Pages/Cookies/).

We may also collect the domain name and email addresses of visitors to this website and those that communicate with us via email. We may also collect other aggregate information, e.g. information about the pages users access or visit and the transactions they perform there and any other information volunteered by the user, such as survey information and/or site registrations. We can also identify the web browser that the user is using and the way in which the user has accessed our website, e.g. via a particular hyperlink or link contained within a marketing email.

The information we collect in this way is used for internal review and improvement purposes, e.g. to improve and/or customize the content, and/or layout of our websites for our users or each individual user. This information is not shared with other organizations for commercial purposes.

## Data protection and information security

Our ecommerce activities are certified to the best practice information security standard ISO 27001 and we follow strict security procedures for obtaining, processing and storing the personal information with which we have been entrusted.

We will not disclose or make your personal information available to a third party (otherwise than where indicated within this privacy policy) without your consent.

You can help to protect your personal information by ensuring that you keep your login password secure. We also recommend that you log out of your account once you have completed your transaction or enquiry, especially if you are using a shared computer.

We will, at your request, provide you with a copy of any personal information that we are holding about you. We will charge an administration fee of Â£10 on each occasion that such a request is made and we will require you to prove that you are the person who is the subject of the information that we are holding before disclosing it to you.

We will also correct or delete any inaccurate information that we are holding about you that is brought to our attention.

## Links to other websites

This website may contain links to other third-party websites with whom we have a relationship. However, we are not responsible for these websites and their privacy practices. We therefore suggest that you read the privacy policy statements on any website that you visit from a link on this site, as their policies and procedures may differ from our own.

## Changes to this privacy policy

If we decide to change this privacy policy we will post the changes here. However, if we intend to make material changes to the way we use your personal information we will seek your consent before doing so.
