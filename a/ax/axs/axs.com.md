## General Overview

This Privacy Policy applies to our web site, [axs.com](http://axs.com/) (the "Site") as well as the AXS mobile application (the "Mobile App").  The Site and Mobile App are collectively referred to in this Privacy Policy as the "Services." The Services are owned and operated Outbox AXS, LLC, which processes sales for events in the United States, and its subsidiaries and its affiliates, including 9390936 Canada, Inc. which processes sales in Canada (collectively, "AXS" or "we"). The purpose of this Privacy Policy is to disclose to you what information we may collect when you use our Services, how we may collect it, with whom we may share it, and certain other matters related to such information, including the choices you have regarding our collection of information and our use and disclosure to other parties of information we may have collected from you. This Privacy Policy is incorporated into the [Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/about-terms-of-use.html) for our Services. Terms not otherwise defined herein shall have the meaning ascribed to such terms in the [Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/about-terms-of-use.html).

AXS has received TRUSTe's Privacy Seal signifying that this Privacy Policy and our practices have been reviewed for compliance with the TRUSTe program viewable on the validation page available by clicking the TRUSTe seal. The TRUSTe program covers only information that is collected through our Site and does not cover information that may be collected through our Mobile App.

If, after contacting us, you have an unresolved privacy or data use concern that we have not addressed satisfactorily, please contact TRUSTe at <https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request>.

AXS is committed to protecting your privacy. We use the information we collect about you to process and complete the commercial transactions you request that can be completed on our Services, and to provide you with a more personalized experience on our Services. We may also use certain information for marketing purposes. We have created this Privacy Policy in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to protecting the privacy of all of our customers and visitors. Except as otherwise discussed in this Privacy Policy, this document only addresses the use and disclosure of information we collect from you online. For some services, including ticket sales, we collect and transfer personal information to a service provider and/or Partner (as defined below), and we act as a service provider for our clients, the venues, promoters, and/or teams ("Clients"), when we sell tickets on their behalf. We encourage you to review the venue, promoter, and/or team's privacy policy before purchasing tickets on our Services. Or, as a result of visiting our Services you may visit or click-through to other merchants (e.g. unaffiliated ticket sites) through links on our Services who may collect and use your personal information in ways that are different than how we utilize your information. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of these sites before you disclose your personal information to others. We may occasionally transfer your personal information to our sponsors, partners, and other third parties (collectively, "Partners") as further described in our Privacy Policy. 

AXS complies with the U.S. – E.U. Safe Harbor Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use and retention of personal data from European Union member countries. AXS has certified that it adheres to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access, and enforcement.

**Types of information that may be collected**

For purposes of this Privacy Policy, " **personal information** " is information which can be used to distinguish or trace an individual's identity, such as their name, email address, etc. whether used alone, or when combined with other personal or identifying information which is linked or linkable to a specific individual. The personal information we collect is used to facilitate the purchase and delivery of tickets and/or other products, services, or information to our customers, and we may require our customers to provide certain personal information in some instances. We also collect non-personal information such as browsing patterns, geographic location and demographics, which does not reveal your specific identity, as further described below. The categories of information collected by our Mobile App will be disclosed at the time you download the Mobile App from the applicable mobile application "store" using your mobile device, and are also described below. 

Please read the following to learn more about our data collection policies and practices:

  * We may require users and/or customers wishing to participate in any of our contests, drawings, sweepstakes, promotions, newsletters, or other interactive features which may or may not involve a purchase to complete an entry or similar form which will require the submission of certain personal information. 
  * The personal information that may be collected in an entry or similar form includes, but may not be limited to, customer's first name, last name, zip code, phone number, age and email address. Winners of contests, drawings, sweepstakes, and/or promotions will be required to provide additional personal information such as a shipping address and telephone number. If the privacy policy varies for a particular sweepstakes, promotion or feature, that information will be disclosed in the sweepstakes or promotion rules or feature's terms of use. 
  * In order to complete the purchase of a ticket, a product and/or service on the Site or Mobile App, an online credit card transaction is required. During this process we generate and collect certain personal information. 
  * The personal information that may be collected from our customers in completion of a ticket, product and/or service purchase, includes, but may not be limited to: customer's first and last name, first and last name of the credit card owner, credit card billing address, credit card number, credit card security code, credit card expiration date, customer's shipping address, phone number, and email address. You may also have the opportunity to permit us to maintain this information in a personal profile for you so you do not have to re-enter the information each time you make a purchase. If a customer sends us personal correspondence, such as emails or letters, we may collect such information into a file specific to you. 


  * If you choose to use our AXS InviteTM feature, we ask you for your friend's name and email address. We will send your friend an invite email on your behalf. AO or our service providers store this information for the sole purpose of sending this invitation email along with subsequent email reminders if your friend has not responded to the original request. Your friend may contact us at [privacypolicy@axs.com](mailto:privacypolicy@axs.com) to request that we remove this information from our database.

**How is this information collected?**

We may collect information from you in several different areas on the Services, including but not limited to those described below: 

**Registration**

If you register on our Services, you will be asked to complete a registration form and provide personal information; you may also be asked to choose a user ID and password in order to take advantage of certain features our Services may choose to offer, including, but not limited to, newsletters, contests, notifications, or other services.

**Newsletters, Emails, Mobile Offers**

We may offer newsletters and/or other communications to share information with you about the Services, about us and our affiliates and subsidiaries, or about our business partners, advertisers and sponsors. You may receive a newsletter from us or our Partners (as appropriate) either by registering for a particular newsletter, offer, or category of offers (e.g. Partner offers), or in conjunction with a special feature or membership for which you have registered through the Services. You may cancel your subscription by following the instructions provided on the Services, in the designated area of the newsletters or emails, or as specified in a mobile communication. Remember, if you consent to receive Mobile App alerts or texts from us, your wireless carrier may impose a charge on incoming texts. Please check with your wireless carrier for details.

**Contests or Sweepstakes**

We may operate contests and sweepstakes through the Services, which may require registration in order to enter. Your personal information may be used to contact you for winner notification, prize delivery confirmation or other promotional purposes. Your entry in the contest or sweepstakes may also result in your being added to our marketing lists as well as those of our promotional partners associated with the contest or sweepstakes. Acceptance of a prize may require you (unless prohibited by law) to allow us to post publicly some of your information on the Services, such as on a winner's page. In some instances, a third party advertiser or sponsor may operate or host a contest or sweepstakes on the Services, and collect your information. In those cases, we may have no control over the information collected and accordingly urge you to review the official rules of the contest/sweepstakes as well as the advertiser's or sponsor's privacy policy, before participating.

**Surveys or Voting**

From time-to-time we may request personal information from you via surveys or voting polls. Participation is voluntary and you will have the opportunity to decide whether or not to disclose information. At times, you may have to register to vote or to take part in a survey. By completing the survey, you consent to our collection of any Personal Information and other data you provide, and use of that personal information and other data to administer, respond to, analyze or otherwise complete the survey process or as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy.

## **If you use our Mobile App**

If you download and use our Mobile App, we or third party service providers may collect certain information through that Mobile App. Information collected may include the personal information and other registration, login, or payment information you choose to provide; information about your device, such as your IP address, OS, device model, your device's proprietary advertising identifier; and information relating to how you use the Mobile App, such as the content you view, ads you click, and purchases you make. When you consent to our use of location services, or otherwise depending on the settings on your mobile device, we or third party service providers may collect the precise location information provided by your device, including data provided by your GPS, WiFi, or data obtained when the Mobile App interacts with a beacon or other technology at a venue. 

We may use data collected from physical proximity beacons (which may be located in some of the venues or events for which we have sold tickets) to send you relevant, targeted offers based on this data (for example, a discount on food purchases near our event). We and any third parties enabling these features may store this data and combine it with other information about you. You may disable the communication of these beacons with your mobile device by disabling Bluetooth or modifying your preferences for location services through your OS. 

We collect the information primarily to facilitate the functionality of our Mobile App and deliver relevant content to you. For example, we may collect your registration and payment information so we can show you content that interests you and to process transactions on your behalf. We may collect your device's location in order to show you offers or features available near you, to deliver more relevant information and ads, and to understand how users interact with a venue or at events we have ticketed. We may combine data we collect through our Mobile App with other information we hold about you so that we can personalize or improve the relevance and quality of the services we provide you.

**Tracking Technologies**

AXS and our Partners may employ industry common tracking technologies such as: cookies, beacons or pixel tags, and scripts on the Services to provide you with an efficient and personalized experience, to help us better understand our users, and to present information we or our Partners believe would be of interest to you. Analytics tools such as Google Analytics and Omniture Reports & Analytics are used in analyzing trends, administering the Services, tracking users' movements around the Services and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these companies on an individual as well as aggregated basis. To learn more about, or to opt-out of Google's analytic and marketing services, visit [Google Analytics Terms of Use](http://www.google.com/analytics/tos.html), the [Google Privacy Policy](http://www.google.com/privacypolicy.html), or [Google Analytics Opt-out](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en-GB).

When you first use our Services, AXS may send a cookie to your computer that identifies you as a unique user. We may use session cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them) to store your preferences, identify you and maintain your signed-in status, provide advertising as described below, and provide you with a more personal and interactive experience. You can set your browser to refuse cookies or delete persistent cookies by following your browser's help instructions. If you choose to disable cookies, some of our services may not work properly and your experience on areas of our Services may be limited.

We use Local Storage Objects (LSOs) such as HTML5 to store content information and preferences. Third parties with whom we partner to provide certain features on our Site or to display advertising based upon your Web browsing activity use LSOs such as HTML 5 to collect and store information. Various browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML5 LSOs. 

To learn more about cookies and similar tracking technologies, and how they can affect your privacy, visit [allaboutcookies.org](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/).

**Behavioral Targeted Advertising/Ad Re-targeting**

We partner with third parties to either display advertising on our Services or to manage our advertising on other sites. Our third party partners may use technologies such as cookies to gather information about your activities on our Services and other sites in order to provide you advertising based upon your browsing activities and interests.  We or a third party may also place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser, which may reflect de-identified demographic or other data linked to data you voluntarily have submitted to us, that we may share with a data provider or other third party.  

These third-party tracking technologies may be set to, among other things: (a) help deliver relevant, personalized advertisements or content to you on our Services or third party sites; (b) prevent you from seeing the same advertisements too many times; and (c) understand the effectiveness of the advertisements that have been delivered to you. To achieve these purposes, our partners may use the shared information in a number of ways, including (i) to evaluate the nature of the connection across your devices, browsers, or applications; (ii) to assess the suitability of your desktop or mobile device for interest- or demographic-based content; (iii) to provide information and inferences about user interests to third parties; and (iv) to develop insights and reports relating to the presentation of customized advertisements or content, including statistical reports in connection with activity on a website, optimization of ad placement and performance, development of reach and frequency metrics, billing activities, and tracking ads served on a particular day to a particular website.  Our partners may also combine shared information with additional non-identifying information collected from other sources to enhance these activities.  

We and third-party vendors, including Google, use first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookie) and third-party cookies (such as a DoubleClick cookie) together to report how your ad impressions, other uses of ad services, and interactions with these ad impressions and ad services are related to visits to our Services. To learn more about how to opt out of Google's use of cookies, visit [Google's Ads Settings](https://www.google.com/settings/u/0/ads/authenticated). To learn more about how to opt out of DoubleClick's use of cookies, visit the [DoubleClick opt-out page](https://www.google.com/settings/u/0/ads/authenticated). Please note, most modern browsers include a "do not track" feature that may help protect your privacy. However, because there is not yet a defined response to do-not-track requests, our Site does not respond to your browser's do-not-track request. 

If you do not wish to not have your information used for the purpose of serving you interest-based ads, you may opt-out by clicking [http://preferences-mgr.truste.com](http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/) or visit the Digital Advertising Alliance in the U.S. at http://www.aboutads.info/choices or in Canada at <http://youradchoices.ca/choices>(or if located in the European Union click [http://www.youronlinechoices.eu](http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/). Please note this does not opt you out of being served all ads.  You will continue to receive generic ads. 

**IP Addresses and Click-stream Data**

As is true of most web sites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. We may collect IP addresses and/or click-stream data for purposes of system administration, to improve our Services, to report aggregate information to our advertisers and sponsors and/or other internal uses related to the Services. An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you access the Internet. Our computers identify your computer by its IP address. When you request Web pages from the Services, our computers log your IP address. 

Click-stream data is information collected by our computers when you request Web pages from the Services. Click-stream data may include such information as the page served, the time, the source of the request, the type of browser making the request, the preceding page view and other such non-personal information. When analyzed, this data helps us analyze how visitors arrive at the Services, what type of content is most popular, what type of visitors in the aggregate are interested in particular kinds of content and advertising, and the like.

We may combine this automatically collected log information with other information we collect about you. We do this to improve services we offer you, to improve marketing, analytics, or Site functionality.

**Transaction Information**

If you place an order on our Services, we will ask you to complete an order form that will request certain information from you, including financial information such as a credit card number and expiration date and general contact, billing and shipping information. We will use this information to complete the transaction that you have requested, e.g., to deliver the information, products or other services that you order, and to send you a record of your transaction. Such information is collected and stored through encrypted means for your protection.

**How we use the information we collect**

We internally use personal information about our customers for the purpose it was collected (for example, to deliver the ticket you purchased), to improve our marketing and promotional efforts, to statistically analyze usage, to improve our content and product offerings and to customize our content and layout, or for the other purposes described in this Privacy Policy. We believe these uses allow us to improve our Services and provide better services and information to our customers. 

We may use a customer's email address and mailing address or phone number, to contact a customer regarding administrative matters or notices, issues with a transaction, satisfaction with the Services and/or our products and services, to provide further information regarding additional events, products and/or services in which we or our third party partners believe the customer would be interested, or as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy.  We may also acquire information about you from other sources, and aggregate it with the information we have obtained from you in order to create a more complete profile. 

We may also use information in the file we maintain about a customer to resolve disputes and troubleshoot problems, or for our, or our Clients', other business purposes.

**To whom the information may be disclosed.**

We will share your personal information with third parties in the ways that are described in this privacy policy, or in accordance with your choices (for example, when you opt-in to receive Partner offers). When appropriate, our Partners may contact you regarding goods and services they provide which may be of interest to you.nformation we collect may be accessed by a variety of parties, depending upon the purpose for which the information was provided and the context in which the information was provided. 

If you register with the Site or Mobile App, your information and information related to purchases you make on any of our Services will be aggregated and maintained as part of your profile and may potentially be accessed or used by us, our affiliates, our Partners, and our Clients, or shared by us with third parties, to provide you with offers, information or marketing communications we think may interest you. 

In order to process your requests we may provide your personal information to service providers or other companies who work on our behalf in order, for example, to process the transaction and deliver the tickets or other goods/services you have ordered. When we do so, we use reasonable efforts to assure that they comply with our Privacy Policy and applicable law. When we are acting as a service provider on behalf of a Client, we provide your personal information to the Client for use, among other things, in connection with identification/verification of purchasers of tickets and event security, marketing future events to you, or for other business purposes. The Client may in turn share your personal information with the promoter for a specific concert or event, or with other parties, and may use the information in accordance with their usual business practices. 

In addition, in the event that we go through an existing or potential business transition, such as a merger, acquisition, liquidation or sale of all or a portion of our assets, customer information will, in most instances, be part of the assets transferred. 

We may, without your consent, access and disclose your personal information, any communications sent or received by you, and any other information that we may have about you as may be permitted or required by law, regulation, rule or court order pursuant to requests from governmental, regulatory or administrative agencies or law enforcement authorities; or to prevent, investigate, identify persons or organizations potentially involved in, or take any action regarding suspected fraud, violations of our Terms of Use, or activity that appears to us to be illegal or we believe may expose us to legal liability. Additionally, we may disclose personal information in situations that we believe to be emergencies involving potential threats to the physical safety or any person or property if we believe that your information in any way relates to that threat. 

Finally, your information may be provided (by us) to Partners, or affiliates, our service providers, and other companies, to the extent permitted by applicable laws and regulations in the circumstances described in this Privacy Policy. Otherwise we will not provide your information to unaffiliated third parties. 

Your information when provided to Partners, Clients, affiliates, or other third parties is subject to the usage and protections outlined in that party's privacy policy and related terms.  You may contact the third party, using the means of communication specified in their policies, web and mobile tools and/or email correspondence, to limit and/or remove the use of your information by that party. However, we do not control your information once it has been provided to a third party. 

Remember, when we sell tickets, we do so as a service provider for our Clients. We do not control the privacy practices of our Clients. If you wish to confirm the privacy practices of one of our Clients, please review the Client's privacy policy or contact the Client directly.

This includes links from advertisers, sponsors and partners that may use one of our logos as part of a co-branding agreement. These other websites or services may send their own cookies to you, independently collect data or solicit personal information and may or may not have their own published privacy policies. If you visit a website that is linked to our Services, you should carefully review that site's privacy policy before providing any personal information. 

**Single Sign-On**
